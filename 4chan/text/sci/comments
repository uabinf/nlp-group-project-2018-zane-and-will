whats the general consensus on that guy  the scientific community seems to completely ignore him yet he manages to get his research published  has anyone ever replicated his experiments if they were legit it would mean that sunlightwaterfree energy or quasiperpetual motion  i havent looked too deep into this stuff and wanna know if its worth to do  guy is a professor at washington university pollacklaborg/publications
  i mean he is a prof who is highly specialized in water that slowly became a skitzo who made their own journal to publish their quakery in
    crazy person
why doesnt this guy just power his lab with the fucking water
or build a water powered generator
  water filtering any impurities by itself
i mean i guess water could form a hexagonal lattice but i would assume that you couldnt do it in a system like what is pictured here    you may even get it to align properly enough for it to become a semisolid superconductor assuming you could make 2 d sheets of it under immense pressure     i havent looked at anything hes gotten published because it seems that he made that journal himself as well as   looking utterly retarded
  plasma is the fourth phase    and op is a faggot
  sunlightwaterfree energy  uh do you also go around saying solar panels are sunlight  silicon  free energy unless he claims more energy out than the sunlight puts in its not free energy
        saw this the other day
  llliiiiiiiiiqqqquuueeeeeeeeeeeeeeed 
  toxic bulk water
  so useful now they can harness fusion by building a large box with liquid metal at 10000k shooting down on a plate at 1000 f/s wow
  cool i guess though its basically a fancy triboelectric generator and theres nothing really special about the plasma it creates
  i mean im a grad student doing advanced materials if someone said they could make plasma with a stream of water and a crystal sheet i would have laughed at them yeah now we know but i think it is at least a little surprising/interesting that fluid shear can create plasma
rice university researchers have discovered a fundamentally different form of lightmatter interaction in their experiments with gold nanoparticles    they werent looking for it but students in the lab of rice chemist stephan link found that exciting the microscopic particles just right produced a nearperfect modulation of the light they scatter the discovery may become useful in the development of nextgeneration ultrasmall optical components for computers and antennas    a paper about the research appears in the american chemical society journal acs nano    the work springs from the complicated interactions between light and plasmonic metal particles that absorb and scatter light extremely efficiently plasmons are quasiparticles collective excitations that move in waves on the surface of some metals when excited by light    the rice researchers were studying pinwheellike plasmonic structures of cshaped gold nanoparticles to see how they responded to circularly polarized light and its rotating electric field especially when the handedness or the direction of rotation of the polarization was reversed they then decided to study individual particles    we stripped it back into the simplest possible system where we only had a single arm of the pinwheel with a single incident light direction said lauren mccarthy a graduate student in the link lab we werent expecting to see anything it was a complete surprise when i put this sample on the microscope and rotated my polarization from left to righthanded i was like are these turning on and off thats not supposed to happen      she and colead author kyle smith a recent rice alumnus had to go deep to figure out why they saw this giant modulation      
at the start they knew shining polarized light at a particular angle onto the surface of their sample of gold nanoparticles attached to a glass substrate would create an evanescent field an oscillating electromagnetic wave that rides the surface of the glass and traps the light like parallel mirrors an effect known as a total internal reflection    they also knew that circularly polarized light is composed of transverse waves transverse waves are perpendicular to the direction the light is moving and can be used to control the particles visible plasmonic output but when the light is confined longitudinal waves also occur where transverse waves move up and down and side to side longitudinal waves look something like blobs being pumped through a pipe as illustrated by shaking a slinky    they discovered the plasmonic response of the cshaped gold nanoparticles depends on the outofphase interactions between both transverse and longitudinal waves in the evanescent field    for the pinwheel the researchers found they could change the intensity of the light output by as much as 50 percent by simply changing the handedness of the circularly polarized light input thus changing the relative phase between the transverse and longitudinal waves      when they broke the experiment down to individual cshaped gold nanoparticles they found the shape was important to the effect changing the handedness of the polarized input caused the particles to almost completely turn on and off    simulations of the effect by rice physicist peter nordlander and his team confirmed the explanation for what the researchers observed    we knew we had an evanescent field and we knew it could be doing something different but we didnt know exactly what mccarthy said that didnt become clear to us until we got the simulations done telling us what the light was actually exciting in the particles and seeing that it actually matches up with what the evanescent field looks like
it led to our realization that this cant be explained by how light normally operates she said we had to adjust our understanding of how light can interact with these sorts of structures    the shape of the nanoparticle triggers the orientation of three dipoles concentrations of positive and negative charge on the particles mccarthy said      the fact that the halfring has a 100nanometer radius of curvature means the entire structure takes up half a wavelength of light she said we think thats important for exciting the dipoles in this particular orientation    the simulations showed that reversing the incidentpolarized light handedness and throwing the waves out of phase reversed the direction of the center dipole dramatically reducing the ability of the halfring to scatter light under oneincident handedness the polarization of the evanescent field then explains the almost complete turning on and off effect of the cshaped structures    interestingly we have in a way come full circle with this work link said flat metal surfaces also support surface plasmons like nanoparticles but they can only be excited with evanescent waves and do not scatter into the far field here we found that the excitation of specifically shaped nanoparticles using evanescent waves produces plasmons with scattering properties that are different from those excited with freespace light    
  so now were getting closer to why another species did what it did to us or perhaps why it does what it does to us
  i actually tried to find research work with this guy over last summer didnt have room in his lab i had to settle for a digital communications gig which sucked because i dont care for that stuff and wanted to do photonics
gold supplementation  uv radiation exposure  
  go to bed tsoukalos youre fucking drunk
does being alone make us who we are  or does who we are make us alone
asking questions like that is what makes you alone
who we are makes us alone for sure
  i dont care about your problems
  no gf makes us alone
  i think people who are alone more often escape to the science
  both
  do you think there are people that dont know what it is like to be alone
the main thing here is that introversion anxiety and internet addiction are a horrible combination
  a bit of both i would say but moreso the latter the default is to be surrounded by others so its pushing against the gradient to end up alone you either isolate yourself because you dont enjoy being with others or others exclude you for whatever reason being alone for extended amounts of time could warp you and lead you to prefer solitude or simply become unable to escape it
being alone is empirically obvious in any given situation how you emotionally feel about it is how you interpret that situation
why has nuclear power fallen so massively out of use with only so few new reactors being built in the west
massively dangerous and polluting some studies also take into account the indirectly produced co2 pollution and it is damning
  three mile island chernobyl fukushima
  they are really expensive to build and maintain just like all power plant types and like all forms of energy generation they need massive amounts of subsidies to even break even let alone make a profit since subsidies are something that is transient and competitive to get you have other power generation technologies competing for the same pool of subsidies meaning theres only so much money to go around      
  lower demand literally thats it people want solar and wind they dont know or care about the applications for space travel electric cars machines etc they just want to live their lives peacefully unaware or ignoring that life is pure war every breath is a war war against bacteria war against viruses against funghi war against radiation and parasites war against the animals the plants the seas and the air war against chemicals against corrosion and entropy itself there is no escape except absolute and total victory
  three mile island wasnt even a bad thing  not a single person was injured    fukushima was caused by retarded nips putting a fucking reactor on one of the most earthquake heavy countries in the world and putting it on the fucking coast    chernobyl was enitrely the fault of the atypical reactor design of the rmbk if they had used a different material it wouldnt have been unstable at lower temperatures but because it was so atypical no one knew the material had that property    being afraid of nuclear means you dont actually know about nuclear deaths per energy generated nuclear is the safest energy period
  lots of excuses to accept misery  grow up    the universe can be boiled down to one thing and one thing only you feed or you are fed upon you eat and meet metabolic demands or youre eaten by bacteria living in your blood that have colonized your brain and organs yes that live in your bowel and that live on your skin even a sun feeds or it is fed upon though its arguable if an entity can eat another or if they just merge at that scale both losing their identity    anyway life is many kinds of conflict you can make it easy on yourself or long brutal and miserable not all ease should be pursued and not all stressors should be accepted dont take offense but once youve actually lived this becomes clear
  nimbys
    this  is why but not for the reasons stated    too many retards think that nuclear is dangerous and too many retards think nuclear pollutes worse than any other form of energy generation    they always point to obsolete designs that have been bandaged throughout the years that have failed just like  when we have reactors that are so safe you can walk away from them and they will be self contained for hundreds if not thousands of years     wind is relatively nontoxic to produce but kills large amounts of wildlife changes micro climates in surrounding areas  solar is probably the worst renewable you can make due to toxic manufacturing processes and the chemicals involved   hydro kills alot of wildlife ruins fish populations within the rivers they inhabit concrete slowly leeches poison into waterways
          3 nuclear major disasters in 76 years of nuclear energy  meanwhile have major oil spills every single year which pollute the oceans and seas
  all miseries should be accepted only through acceptance can they be overcome
  you can choose to make it easy   sometimes war just comes a knockin no prep time just action no choice in the matter when a meteorite hits or lightning strikes
they bury radiactive nuclear materials into the soil    let that sink in
  wind is relatively nontoxic to produce but kills large amounts of wildlife changes micro climates in surrounding areas  wind requires petrochemicals or gmo onions / cotton oil to lubricate bearings it also creates subsonics and high levels of dirty electricity when run through typical inverters because no one gives half a shit about anything theyre also somewhat ugly    solar is probably the worst renewable you can make due to toxic manufacturing processes and the chemicals involved   solar is barely a crude mimicry of what is achieved by plants same problem with inverters panels that use telerium and indium require ravaging third world ecologies to mine    hydro kills alot of wildlife ruins fish populations within the rivers they inhabit concrete slowly leeches poison into waterways  yep separate streams for fish to jump up dont entirely work concrete leaks a constant supply of garbage into waterways but  fukushima still pouring shit out everywhere maybe it sinks maybe it gets uptaken by migratory species and trafficked everywhere  one goof    lftr seems like the only feasible technology  neutron poisoning  shit my reactor is shutting down periodically better scrap it war effort or none xenon whats that
  an airplane crash killing 200 people gets orders of magnitude more attention than the sum of a hundred automobile accidents killing two people each on average
im currently attending a pretty okay university with about a 23 acceptance rate known for its difficult grading    im looking for any study tips or any tips in general
bump
  do practice problems a lot simply taking notes and reading the book wont get you very far theory is easy to understand you need to be able to explain them mathematically as well  im a third year physics major and desu i struggled with this for a bit but you sort of just have to accept the reality it also gets really fun once you reach theoretical mechanics
  what year are you in studying for intro physics/calc/chem really just entails practice problems   i found that in upper level course practice problems dont help and thorough readings are far more useful bc the tests will actually make you think
join the space force
  just drop out all smart people dropped out just look at bill gates and that apple dude
  get me mayo with fries faggot
set small goals and take frequent breaks as rewards whenever im doing math or physics which are typically 10 problems per math and 68 for physics i do half and then take a break to play a game or something and then come back and finish im in ee and never really do practice problems for any of my classes chegg is a quitters pussy ass way out but it helps if you follow the problem and learn from them
tonight in us of a look south around 630pm comet number 46 is visible just below uranus    take a picture and post it
  my bortle number sucks  im in colorado will i still be able to see it
  can i see this in la with the naked eye
  witnessed can confirm though with terrible light polution i couldnt see the tail but i saw the bright center of it it was as bright as mars and looked slightly redish
what the fuck should i pick as an iphone star/planet ar locater thing
alright you dorks ill go outside and take a pic through by 12 chinese spoting scope
            input your info and get a live view of sky the comet sets too soon i usually have dinner with wife and kids before heading out with kiddies to look at sky but today wife ordered us to eatonly after seeing the comet  i was able to see it had to hold the optics for my daughter son was able to use his fist to find the comet tail was smallish dec 12 it reaches max visibly with naked eye fun any nevada anons on the air we have a small group of stargazers in lv     to those confused about finding sky objects w/o smart phone lookup the book stars by clock and fist 1950s if you are a newbie great book but the planets are outdated    pic is a picture of uranus
  how expensive of a telescope do i need to get chicks
damn its snowing here ill try again later
  i would start with some binocs just to get started  as far as the chicks thing i wouldnt know i assume get a telescope with some gold plating and other bling that way you look like a potential provider also shower daily
is this series really convergent im trying to use the alternating series theorem and the limit of bn really goes to 0 and thats the first condition    the second condition states that for any n bn1  bn but this doesnt happen for any n since the derivative of the associated function is less than 0 only after x  4    any ideas of how i should deal with it
im so happy i dont have to do this autistic shit any more  fuck calc 2
  sum the first 4 terms then add the remaining series  as long as bn1  bn for all n bigger than some n it should work
  what are you doing now
  yes because according to lebnitz criterion 1n times something that goes to zero converges sqrtn/n4 goes to zero so it go to zero
some big numbers are really big  real numbers in the neighborhood of infinity  
schizo poster lost will to live
  that image is great stuff
  the image looks pretty fun i wonder what it might mean is it some function that goes from a somewhat folded plane to a straight plane to a halfsphere
  maybe curvature negative curvature zero curvature positive curvature
  hello newfriend
  this is a collage of my most of my most important results indeed the curvature is the main thing i put into it i wanted to show how flat minkowski space is embedded in a continuum of smoothly varying curvature i also wanted to make it periodic and that is a major thing in my research program the idea is to send the curvature parameters to / infinity and then join them on the topological singularity associated with infinite curvature     another thing in there however is how to make a volume of zero curvature if the curvature changes along some smooth parameter then there is only one thin sheet in the universe where the curvature is truly zero even while all our experiments suggest that the entire expanse of the whole universe is flat however i recently solved that problem when x5 is the direction perpendicular to the red plane h i can put numbers in the neighborhood of the origin inside h and numbers in the neighborhood of / infinity on either side then i just have to write some function of three variables basically which should make everything easy that seemed hard when i thought it had to be a function of one variable
  i feel like jon still doesnt understand that you cant choose properties of numbers and that they should be derived from their definition and operations defined on them you cant just define hatinf as inf just with no absorption just like you couldnt define i to be 1 first you would have to define what i is rxr then define operations on it namely ab  cd  ac  bd ad  da  and then derive the property that 0 1  0 1  0  1 0  0  1 0 and call 0 1 i
how did infinity get the property of additive absorption to begin with ill tell you how someone said im going to write down a sentence that says infinity has additive absorption
a real number x  r is a cut in the real number line lol no  also the neighbourhood of postive or negative infinity is already defined its the open interval from a real number x to infinity
  lol no  good argument you have convinced me with your hot opinions    the neighbourhood of postive or negative infinity is already defined its the open interval from a real number x to infinity  this is wrong but i suppose it is trivial that you have conflated positive infinity and negative infinity other than that this is pretty much definition of the neighborhood of infinity which i use i am more specific about what x is however
  if youre confident in your work why dont you take all of it and march into a university and start showing your results  im genuinely not being patronizing im serious if you think your work is really good why are you just posting it on this board and not trying to show it to other mathematicians
  lets see how that would assume ive walked into a university further assume i have walked into the office of the math department further assume that the secretary is looking away from her facebook as if to inquire me about im there   then what    not trying to show it to other mathematicians  i post it on other websites too i assume mathematicians use the internet and also look at posts on the internet
  printing at 015 per page is prohibitively expensive in my current state of homeless indigence
see i guess they said let us kidnap him and drug him and slice his flesh and drill his bones and then stick this thing in his foot so he wont walk like that anymore but what they really meant was lets put this thing in there so his foot always hurts and hell have to limp around on it all the time i had bone drilling knee surgery in 2005 i know from experience that this something which hurts for years    this is why youre supposed to ask me if i want you to kidnap and drug me and slice my flesh and drill my bones and not instead ask my enemy who will get to enjoy the chuckle when im limping because my foot hurts instead of just walking how i usually do
  i tell you i am no pussy about pain but my foot fucking hurts when i walk around on it for a while it hurts less but everytime i sit and then stand or sleep and then wake it fucking hurts like theres a stone implanted in my foot indeed the ecuadorian guy started making those assange is a stone in my shoe comments last spring right around the time of the onset of the extreme pain in my right foot the thing about a stone in your shoe is this you can take your shoe off and shake it out but i cant do that because they drilled my foot bone and screwed the stone securely inside my foot and everyone watching said this is fine
not only that but with respect to the implants in my anus they have said i guess if they arent bothering him then just leave them in there but my gait was not bothering me at all when my foot felt fine and now my foot hurts all the fucking time and it is bothering me a lot
  nah its cool i gave them the ok when they asked and told them to defer future decisions to me so its gonna be gg
  they must have drugged and kidnapped me i have no recollection of it being put in there i only noticed the slices on my heel and the sudden onset of pain also after you drill into bone there is no way to undrill the bone    with regards to the implant in my other foot i noticed a small crescent shaped slice on my toe and then i started getting electrical zaps in my foot i saw some other thread on 4chan where the guy had the exact same cresect shaped slice int he same place on his toes and when i posted in that thread my id said something like  nx1vmd0    which seemed to me like 4chan was telling me that the group which kidnaps me and cuts my flesh and hurts me is that cult nxivm     although they have hurt me some i will hurt them more i will defile them but they have not been able to defile me
  its not ok and they are liars when they say he wanted us to decide for him if he should get kidnapped and drugged and have his flesh sliced and bones drilled and to have a device implanted in his foot that is going to cause constant pain and induce a painful limp to replace the limpy gait that we used as a pretext to inflict this horrible pain on him yes we knew it would hurt but did not write that for obvious reasons even though the surveillance log clearly has him saying he would never have gotten his knee bone drilled if he knew then what he knew later and he clearly indicated on many many occasions that he would never do the bone drilling surgery again we decided that we should tell the lie that he wants us to make decisions for him and also that he actually does want us to drill his bones again and put a torture device in there which we will make up some story about so that it wont get classified as a torture device but yeah what kind of an asshole is going to believe that a device like this is going to cause something other than constant pain
  wrong  its all about tiny numbers that are infinitely tiny this represents how god views all multiple universes and this universe from the 12th dimension
  its not ok  no it totally is you nub scrub  you told me to tell them to do it so i did you big fibber
  you may have snuck up on me while i was asleep hypnotized me and told me to tell you to do it in a state of impeded cognition  it was pretty fucking funny at the time not gonna lie
schizobros not doing so well today
  since i am the king they are probably wrong to force me out of my condo in my midtown in 2012 my apartment in dunwoody in 2017 and then after a year of homeless ended with a house in home park to evict me again causing me to live in a tent i have set up on top of some dirt everything they do is wrong and the people who abet their wrongdoing will pay a similar price to those who fomented it they think they will pay a lesser price for their abettings but they will pay a similar price
  this is not a troll seriously it is not
  14 branchland court ruckersville va fite me irl tough boy 3 rawr xd
  this thread is obvious troll    there is no neighborhood of infinity  proof is simple and follows  pick any number of the mentioned neiborhood of infinity  it is infintely afaar from infinity thus not in the neiborhood  proven    clearly you do not know the definition of infinity  alea acta est   mussolini
  you should post on /r/ or something
  even if these bogoffs are the perverts they allegedly are i am certain that they have some secret stash of people whose innocence they protect and in whose safety and wellbeing the bogoffs are invested if they have acted against me i will search out that group that they have circled around and i will do to them worse than what they have done to me something much more disrespectful and on a greater scale and to a vastly greater number of people therefore i extend to bogoff the same call to mercy that i give everyone else if you have acted against me then you should kill these people on your own terms because they will be highly favorable to the terms i offer later
  wheres the xrays proving the implants exist
  implants a/k/a bogdabots
no youre right guys my r_inf is the null set because i dont understand the difference between for some and for all i will have to scrap definition 14 and 15 in favor of something that isnt trivial i also have to learn some real math and understand things dont just exist because i have a definition of it i have to prove it isnt a logical contradiction or a null set
  i think usually the burden of showing that a definition leads to a contradiction is on the person who would claim that the definition is not useful for the person who makes the claim this is the definition that claim is automatically true if one wishes to show in other work that the definition is not useful for analysis then the burden show it is on the author of that other work    also please clarify what problem arises by reliance on the phrase for some for instance x  5 satisfies  n  x  n    for some n but certainly not for all n
  also please clarify what problem arises by reliance on the phrase for some  the problem is that every single x in r satisfies n  x  n for some n in n which makes r0 equal to r
  wrong and stupid
not only that but look at all these assholes who said he needs to learn more linear algebra or he needs to learn more qft if i would have gone off in those other directions chasing other peoples research rather than building my own then who would have noticed this important thing right in the heart of all mathematics pure and applied
  look if you are not going to listen why ask these questions in the first place
  for some n i will choose n1 then 099 is in the neighborhood of 0 and 101 is in the neighborhood of infinity
  let me revise my statement not knowing the difference between for some and for any unless you agree with 
  so where are the xrays wheres the evidence
  for the person who makes the claim this is the definition that claim is automatically true  no thats absolutely not true the burden of proof to support a claim is on anyone who makes a claim if you claim your definition is valid the burden of proof is on you to support your definition
    what kind of fucking asshole spends time on this crap
  one who hasnt had a job for a couple years and is going to be homeless and die alone one day soon
proof of the riemann hypothesis    refute this
  the only claim is that everything is plotted correctly come back when you actually have something that resembles a proof not an engineers justification why he believes it
definition 16  mathlim_ntoinftysum_k1nk/math diverges  thats not how this meme works
  i dont have access to and xray and if i did the xray tech would likely be an agent of my enemy but the evidence is this  1 i observed a slice on my left toe apparently sealed with meat glue and then i started getting electrical shocks on the bottom of my left foot i felt them in as many as four places but lately i only feel one in the arch  2 i observed two very large slices on my right heel apparently sealed with meat glue and then i started experiencing extreme blunt pain when sit or lay down and then stand again  3 digital inspection of my anus yields further evidence there is a device implanted on the side of my anus where the one o fthe varieties of anal electrocution that i experience occurs there is another place that has an electrocutor implant but my finger doesnt go that far    you might say that doesnt prove anything but the obvious implant in my anus that i can feel right where i have the chronic rape/torture senstation indeed does prove that there is an implant there with regards to my feet it is possible that i somehow got slices on my feet and two concurrent injuries on both feet unrelated to implants inserted through the slices but that is stupid furthermore i wuold remind you that the difference between conclusive evidence and other types of evidence is that the other types of evidence are not conclusive
  there is no meme there and you are stupid
  just pull 1 device out of your foot and go to a hospital and tell them to pull the other 1 out of your foot leave the butt ones in thats kinda hot
  its not hot its unambiguous torture i already went to the hospital the doctor inspected my anus and told me he thought it was healthy that i thought i had an implant in there and then sent me away without any medical treatment i suspect the one in my right foot is screwed into my heel bone that is th elikely cause of the constant pain i have felt upon standing froma seated or laying position constantly for the last six months an especially now that its getting cold and in my left foot i dont know if the implant is where i feel the sensation or if it implanted near a nerve in another area    i tell you whose idea was it to drill my fucking foot bone to fix my gait instead of just giving my and orthotic support to put in my shoe whoever it was they did it becasue they knew it would hurt and they are laughing about how it hurts this time last year i had the ability to stand from a seated position and then quickly move this year when i stand i experience terrible pain and have to gimp around slowly for a while before the pain subsides whoever decided that drilling my bone is what should be done and not simply giving me a thing to put in my shoe knew that it would hurt and they did it with malicious intent    last year i could rise from a seated position and then quickly move away from that position now they have taken that away from me and i might never get it back last year i could move around like a healthy human man now i cant because of this torture device they have implanted in my foot unlike the torture devices in my anus and other foot this one is really fucking me up physically not just psychologically and they did it on purpose and you are still asking them for my opinion instead asking me for my opinion
  whose idea was it to drill my fucking foot bone to fix my gait instead of just giving my and orthotic support to put in my shoe  mine lmao  you got trolled hard  next time think before spamming /sci/ and other places with your bullshit or i might put a few in ur dong
what is grahams number used for and how do i write notation for it without running out of atoms to write with
  yeah but i am going to defile you and your loved ones you entire family is going to suffer and then go extinct and everyone that outlives you will hate you and everything bad that ever happened to you and your ancestors is what the time travelers will do because they hate you as much as i do if not more
   as an application in complex analysis  nice
  no you dipshit its because infinity is infinite if i had an infinite length and i subtracted 1 from that length its still infinitie i mean it doesnt matter either way this proof is still retarded tooker proves infinity is infinite if and only if it has additive absorption then he says  hurr assume a modified infinity that is still infinite but doesnt have additive absorption   thats called undefined bud  gayist shit ive seen in all my days
  damn this dude doesnt know what a dedekind cut is
  this
  nah brah  you dont even know who i am
schizo schizo schizo
  posting a big number g64
  i do know what it is its something dedkind published many years after riemann published his hypothesis      yes but how far into the future do you think my ignorance will extend do you think it will exceed the natural life of all of you descendants and theirs and theirs and on and on such that i will never catch up with you and never take away your share in the tree of life maybe you tell yourself that but do you honestly believe it maybe you do
i was looking at the structure of gaussian wavepackets and i noticed that i will not be able to improve them very much while the product of two numbers in the neighborhood of infinity is undefined therefore i defined a rule and i noticed that now these numbers have multiplicative inverses     please criticize
  its something dedkind published many years after riemann published his hypothesis  did riemann know about mathhatinftyb/math when he wrote his paper
  if he had do you think he would have missed all those zeros of his eponymous zeta function whats your point my point is that a definition of real numbers which did not become popular until decades after riemann is not a definition that has to be used when treating riemanns hypothesis you can use it if you want to but to say that it is required is stupid because it didnt exist until years later and was not completely popular until decades later
i think my numbers satisfy all the field axioms now is it required that field is closed under its operations
  the definition with dedekind cuts is identical to defining real numbers as decimal expansions      yes closure is required
    still orders of ackermann magnitude below tree3
  yes closure is required  i looked for this with google today i could not find anything that said fields have to be closed under their operations do you have source that will show it is required
      see a0 and m0
  are you serious
  other than probably any textbook on modern algebra            
  whats your point  the point is that its logically inconsistent to say that any formal construction of the real numbers can be ignored because riemann didnt know about it and then base your entire proof around a type of number that riemann didnt know about
    noice
    i guess the way to make it a field is make infinity not absorb infinity such that  infn  infm    and then say that there is at least some term  infinf which contributes at least as an infinitesimal where as any sum or product resulting the inf number which violates closure such the definition of the additive and multiplicative composition laws is modified by an infinitesimal that can be used to prove that the output of the composition is not exactly at the end point of the extended real line
  some term  infinf  oops
  if you want to do fields with infinities you should probably at least know about hyperreals or the levicivita field or similar nonarchimedean fields
  levicivita field
  yes levicivita field  
  no offense bro but youre pretty ignorant
  yes but i dont have any brothers and im not your bro     how good is your judgement and how far into the future do you think my ignorance will extend
  how good is your judgement  good enough that im not a hobo fighting a one man crusade against reality and correct mathematics d    how far into the future do you think my ignorance will extend  until you man up and realize youre not as smart as you think so however many more years until you finally croak
  its the other people whose crusade is against reality
  ok retard
have you given your addition and multiplication closure yet
  shut the fuck up schizo   you just plantar fasciitis thats fucking it even though doctor told you had nothing in your fucking anus please take your fucking meds
  see      just plantar fasciitis  its weird then how my fasciitis began right after i got that slice on my toe and when i posted about the ordeal someone else made a thread where they had the exact same slice on their toe and when i posted in that thread it was suggested to me that human slavery cult nxivm does such toe slicing procedures    pic related its weird how two of the fasciitis spots were along a line pointing to the slice on my toe
  why dont you make a weird disheveled looking person with speech bubble meme of yourself   its kind of funny seeing this post and  right next to each other because you look so weird and fucked up
so now that you have a field with multiplicative inverses i guess a number in the neighborhood of zero divided by a number in the neighborhood of infinity isnt going to be zero
  which fucking thread was this exactly
  snifff
  apparently without adding the levels of aleph from my other research this is not a field because it is not closed under its operations i see that  1 / inf  b inf a  1 / ba    can be decomposed as   1 / inf  b 1 / inf a     each of these terms is zero so we obtain a contradiction  0  1 / ab    therefore i am glad i did not upload a new version of the paper with this replacing the original nondefinition of the product    good point thanks
  what is this levels of aleph
  dunwoody  is the schizo an atlfag
  e person who makes the claim this is the definition that claim is automatically true if one wishes to show in other work that the definition is not useful for analysis then the burden show it is on the author of that other work    in the context of your picture that is a valid explanation but only if the person who created that definition then never says there exists a real number in the neighborhood of infinity as soon as they want to use such a number they need to prove that at least one such number exists
  nxivm doesnt exist anymore bro and even if it did they recruited middle aged professional women not male math nerds it was just a sex cult for the leader
  criticism  this breaks the total order on the reals  intuitively a total order means that when you add together two numbers bigger than zero you get a result bigger than either one of the numbers and when you multiply two numbers bigger than zero the result is bigger than zero you may deny that an axiomization existed during riemanns time but this intuition is older than him and was and will be accepted as a property of the reals by everyone    axiomatically  y  z  y  w  z  w  y  0 and z  0  yz  0    obviously your second line doesnt break this but your first does because multiplication is distributove over addition take x  2 for example    2h  b  1  1h  b  h  b  h  b  h  2b    but this breaks the total ordering with respect to addition this can be seen by choosing y  h  b z  b and w  h  b clearly y  z but unfortunately y  w  z  w    a way clearer way of looking at it is just by subtracting h  b from both sides if that is allowed    h  b  h  b  h  2b   h  b  b
  correction your second line doesnt break it directly if you want i can show that it does so

  jon btfo
  its a concept of transfinite analysis developed in my physics research      was just a sex cult for the leader  i think it was a fruit of the scientologists but i wont dispute that whoever implanted that thing in me was jerking off to it afterwards      yes thank you i think the contradiciton i invoked   is a better explanation of why it doesnt work
  pls stop with this jon was specifically asking for criticism to improve his work hes making a lot of progress
does anyone have the solution for this problem
  reservoirs and pumps giant windup springs like something out of dr suess
  looks like generation from a very large wind turbine to me     im not quite sure how your graph labels make any sense how would overgeneration cause less power creation    use eddy current brakes that are engaged as it starts to ramp if your ramping is the problem if not consider adding a large capacitor to store charge and only dispel any at your desired average output
  im not even an engineer and i know this what a pleb op
  not like you suckka punch atleast im curious to know
    what is causing the increased ramp
  since when does load refer to generation dungus
  people coming home from work
  kek
    this   how would overgeneration cause less power creation
  the yaxis isnt power generation but demand hence the label at the top low demand and constant production leads to overgeneration and wasted power if the supply isnt variable
cheme thread    friendly advice to all you early ungrads dont buy into this meme dont make the mistakes i made only stick with this major if you are a stellar student absolutely love the material and are willing to take a risk on your employment this is one of the hardest engineering majors there is and you will work hard at it to only find that the number of cheme grads exceeds the number of positions available there is a very good chance you will be ripping your hair out after not being able to find an engineering job
so what is recommended engineering with abundant options for future research / employment i think of electrical engineering
  i dont know meche is memeworthy but its versatile so you can atleast settle for something and have a job at the end of the day    aero is too tiny of a field    bio is a joke     nuclear is dead    electrical is also kind of a joke but atleast you can easily get a cs job    even though its not exactly engineering id say just go with software
chem  normies  mech  npcs  elect  nerds  aero  special snowflakes  bio  no foresight  civil  chad
  civil  chad  glorified construction workers my roommate was civil and all he did was play csgo and league from dawn till dusk any engineering major that lets you play vidya all day every day and still get good grades isnt a real engineering major

  so hes more of a scientist than the average /sci/tard
  ask yourself this what does a scientist do then ask yourself does he do that simple
  no because hes famous fame automatically cancels all your accomplishments
  yep      he has a phd while you cant pass calculus i
  scientists usually have masters or phd in specialized scientific foeld  have a publication history within that field  looks like hes a scientist

  which part did you think was bait
not sure how a psuedoscience would become a science over time isnt it usually the opposite like astrology and alchemy has anything ever actually gone from a psuedoscience to a science  and i dont mean paving the way for an actual science like astrology for astronomy and astrophysics or alchemy for chemistry or psychology for neuroscience or medicine historically full of pseudoscientific myths for biology because thats not what you said when has society ever gone from thinking that some field is full of bullshit to realizing that its actually legit like for an entire established pseudoscientific field not just being skeptical about individual scientists who ended up pioneereing a field in general skepticism increases over time i cant think of a way that any pseudoscience could ever be in its entirety considered science in the future

drew fudenberg on contemporary game theory and the study of learning and the incorporation of psychology and how it relates to nash equilibrium      in this talk drew speaks on two potential equilibrium and how they relate to each other traditional nash eq and a selfconfirming eq which may not be nash eq  a selfconfirming eq exists when peoples expected value for experimentation is lower than persisting with the current strategy they are using they do so because of potentially distorted beliefs in relation to psychological biases and shortsighted thinking  people who are more encouraged to experiment which may mean shortterm failure will be able to reach nash eq in the longrun   whereas those who choose a shortterm selfconfirming eq may or may never be able to reach nash eq
bump because this board is cancer but this thread is trying  ive read a book on game theory any recommendations on where to go from here im pretty busy now but the list can be extended as needed
can a mathlet like me get any practical use out of game theory or would it be a waste of my time
  ive read a book on game theory any recommendations on where to go from here  well if you have a background in math bsc a good place to start is actually drews own book its considered the gold standard for graduate level coursework    if youre still an undergrad looking to get your feet wet i recommend an introduction to game theory by martin j osborne it goes stepbystep a lot of what you do in game theory is proof writing so the book provides plenty of examples to help you along though most of its solutions youre going to have to find in pdf form here     this can be a pain in the ass    if you dont know anything about game theory a good book to start with would be rational choice by itzhak gilboa its written for high school level reading and only covers some light concepts behind game theory    overall though game theory is always handy to get a grasp of because it gets you to think not only about what you are doing but also what others are doing as well and allows you to understand what your limits might be to bargaining with others  if youre interested in some of the more light practical applications of game theory you need only look at portfolio management of a company or your personal life   watch this if you want to get a more practical sense via portfolio management of what game theory can show us about how we frame things it doesnt specifically go into any game theory topic but there is strong correlation there if you read up on the subject

  ive just begun reading von neumanns theory of games and economic behavior it seems like a good place to start is it
  it will only teach you about zerosum games  its a good read for the history but honestly i wouldnt bother with it too much  there are more effective ways to teach the subject  if you can get through some of the material in von neumanns book then you can probably handle an undergraduate textbook on game theory
  ill continue with it and get some more modern material soon then thanks
  ayyy
the universe is strange remember those hulu commercials about aliens sucking out peoples brains joke well truth is sometimes stranger then fiction i wonder what people would do if they knew the show on nbc is very very loosely based on the life of jesus and his best friend the viking samurai his subordinates mislabeled a wolf as a sheep and tried to domesticate it too that girl penny is based off a blonde in his life he had a crush on but well you see leo lion ard how would sheldon feel if he knew his men had basically castrated and lobotomized his best friend causing way too much suffering on their side adventures probably a bit pissed off and he doesnt exactly seem like a person who has the capacity for a ton of regrets lol almost like his brain is more focused on more important things good thing his friends are a bit more warm and seem to like rpgs involving hunting down monsters who do that kind of thing to children heh
the theme song for that show has been proven wrong yet they wont update it lol people watch that shit and think theyre being educated we tested the singularity big bang theory and it turns out the universe was never as hot as we predicted 40 years ago that hot dense state didnt happen    also i didnt read your post its a tv show made by jews what do you expect
you know why assholes fear the light all their secrets come spilling onto it lightbearers are terrifying to some and a nice pleasant warm day to others
while i respect your stance on jews you are leaving yourself wide open for their manipulations if you do not study their form of entertainment first supernatural show in chuck we trust the name of the person who created the show and leaves messages at the end of his sitcoms is called chuck loren or something pretty interesting if you ask me they write everything down and keep records iff you refuse to watch or read something because its from a jew you weaken yourself in the fight against their kikery
    that tv show the big bang theory has more to do with socialism than anything else    youve a theoretical physicist and a experimental physicist living in an apartment that doesnt have a working elevator and they happen to live next to a woman who works in a cheese cake factory
get help op
the fastest thing i know of in this galaxy or universe is a green light particle if one were trying to figure out how to beat that record on the speed of light or maybe create a time travel device one might try to slingshot enough green light particles in mass around a blackhole just a theory also you know why seraphim make that beautiful dangerous music why they have the three heads as above so below heaven has its guardians too they have cerberuss heaven has seraphim that throne you see with three chairs is like an airlock gotta get past that boss to see the big guy trinitys are a divine number youve all heard of the legend of the three monkey judges right yet another pattern of 3 airlocks and redundancies
in all seriousness see if you can find the inspiration for that show via producers the truth of it sheldon and leonard at some point introduce an article that shows that space acts more like the top of a lake its like we already know its not actually a vacuum not a perfect one anyways right objects act more like they are in a water tank then a vacuum when you project their movements and when you try to track things like gravity and sound waves these are the mechanics you are trying to understand /shrug i dont do the math though
  thats pretty wrong things behave a lot more like theyre in a vacc than underwater
how does one get artificial intelligence field      i know its a fast moving field how do i keep up is it too late to get in
  i had to get a bs/ms in comp sci and spend my summers doing reus/research only person i know to get there without comp sci was bs/ms in physics and 10 years of software development/mathematical modeling experience  if theres an easier way idk about it  its not a coding bootcamp kind of skill like web development
  this no one will give you the time of day without a degree and likely a masters in cs or math with strong coding skills
  phd in math or cs or stat or maybe a masters and 5 years of experience being a swe at google

  just do the syllabus for an intro to ai class you will certainly need to know c/c and at least the basics of digital logic and circuits though if you dont know what an alu is youre probably in for a bad time
  none of these people have the right ideas  read the book universal artificial intelligence  the deep learning book  the research guide of intelligenceorg  watch andrew ngs mooc  read on vingean reflection  read understanding machine learning  read thinking and deciding  read on probability theory statistics decision theory game theory multivariate calculus single variable calculus linear algebra information theory odes  read an introduction of computability or an introduction to automata languages and computation or some book of the like  instead of reading the universal artificial intelligence book you could read on algorithmic information theory solomonoff induction aixi kolmogorov complexity bayesian probability philsoophy of science occams razor  read about curiosity and creativity in artificial intelligence  read about the new unified theory of psychology  read on reinforcement learning  read on provability logics  read on all of this applied to natural language processing and machine vision  read on embodied cognition cognitive science merleauponty heidegger philosophy of the mind neuroscience  read and program on data science  find interesting projects learn r learn python learn matlab   read on affective computing on information integration theory on network science on artificial models of fluid intelligence about agents and the environment  what have you the point is this is a really big field and you just have to read something about it ask on google what should i learn to get gud at this aspect of ai to be able to do research on this aspect of ai etc

  too much on just machine learning imho    thanks anon
bump for any info
oh as someone who wrote a machine learning algorithm for seed dispersal during his masters    getting into an ai field is absolutely difficult and by this i mean a real appreciation for creating something thart learns and not a glorified automatic scanner which is basically teaching it to identify set objects with no real ability to operate critically     youll need to head into academic research im afraid a lot of the ai firms out there will waste your time with business projects designed to automate existing jobs because theyre literally so basic that you dont actually need intelligence to do them     currently working on a small learning algorithm that uses simple patterns to explore environments to determine the thresholds for where life can exist which exports and edits its own coding with its library so it literally decides what code to use and changes it     unfortunately this means the boundary conditions are set to the memory levels and new codes are lost if its running past max mem times
  is it pretty easy to get a decent job in ai if i know machine learning and with a statistics ba i just want to get my foot in the door so that i can develop my skills farther in the ai field im graduating next year btw
going to uni soon and not sure what to major in math  self teach programming or just get a cs degree if math should a person major in pure math or stats
  we cant help you without knowing what your actual goals are beyond getting a degree
  im majoring in statistics but ive also taken many math classes    majoring in math is useless unless you go to grad school or you pair it with another degree/skill then it becomes god tier    statistics is great overall but math is more satisfying desu as its more theoretical
  tru
  sorry was just curious about what domain of math complements cs well the current plan is major in pure math and self teach stats and cs/prog      thats what i thought too pure math seems more akin to philosophy and will probably be fun but at the same time people kept saying that its useless and stats is better with cs     maybe just go with the flow and take some stats classes if needed
  maybe just go with the flow and take some stats classes if needed  thats what i did and in the end i just fully switched to statistics     keep in mind math is probably one of the hardest majors but its god tier with anything else because people cannot understand math
  pair math with any application of it so you get handson experience with actually using the shit you know   selfteach programming and demonstrate your ability to program thoroughly on any thesis you write  do summer internships in stats if you need work experience youd be surprised how far apart from the average brainlet you are even with just a firstyear course in stats under your belt
  this also take a math statistic class or read a math statistics book
  ai is not easy to get into  ive been doing it since 4 years currently based in london working for a startup  although my bg is scientific im a physicist worked for years at cern i was very welcome in the field now i am the cdo of the company i have 5 data scientists/engineers  some developers working for the projects i lead  ai is a good field and datascientists feel like rockstars but they as the field itself lack a purpose and all the whitecollar middle aged men think they can conquer the world with ai  there is money to do research in ai for sure but expectations are far beyond the models capabilities  nonlinearity and powerful computers are the cause of such a growing field but because of the non linear nature of it all predictors regressors and classifiers sink into statistical and systematic uncertainties  ill just sit and laugh while i charge 130k/year and supervise the ego of autistic teens they call themselves scientists  sign and recline to investors and ceos unrealistic ambitions while i smoke my tobacco from the balcony of my office

  30 gpa undergrad with statistics ba  18 creds of theoretical math classes which tanked my gpa  econometrics bs     i can only code in python right now but i graduate in 15 years im just trying to see if im btfo from entering the field and will be jobless desu
  start playing around with pandas learn how to manipulate dataframes  numpy scikitlearn  look for an image classification example in github either keras to start with or pytorch avoid tensorflow for the moment  modify it a bit find a new application / dataset / fun problem to solve and commit it into a repository hopefully using some public data i saw one about crimes in san francisco for example  write a little article with your results in medium  you do that 23 times and by the time you are graduating you will be hitting 60k in london 75k in the us depending on your age  soft skills  and always keep studying/reading/keep informed about new ai developments/techniques  the only way i see of hitting over 100k is with a phd or knowing certain market inside out  after 12 years of working experience apply to deepmind or google brain open ai if you get accepted it will be easy to find funding  after that you will have enough experience to start your own thing become cdo ceo of a startup build an ecosystem get big numbers in series a b c  ai could be a good career but you shouldnt stay on the technical coding side  thats only where you should start
  thanks so anon im at the point i can code my nn without the help of a package like keras or pytorch since i understand the math    should i move into using the packages instead for my medium articles or just keep coding my own stuff
  
  
hi /sci/ here are the putnam problems for part 1 i will post part 2 this evening  1 find all ordered pairs a b of positive integers for which  eqn1/a1/b3/2018  2 let maths_1 s_2 dots  s_2n1/math be the nonempty subsets of math1 2 dots n/math in some order and let m be the math2n1  2n1 matrix whose i j entry is   eqnfx  left   beginarrayll   x  quad if s_i cap s_j  emptyset   1  quad otherwise   endarray   right/eqn  calculate the determinant of m
ah fuck looks like i fucked up the equations  1 find all ordered pairs a b of positive integers for which  eqn1/a1/b3/2018eqn  2 let maths_1 s_2 dots  s_2n1/math be the nonempty subsets of math1 2 dots n/math in some order and let m be the math2n1  2n1/math matrix whose i j entry is   eqnfx  left   beginarrayll   x  quad if s_i cap s_j  emptyset   1  quad otherwise   endarray   right/eqn  calculate the determinant of m
you can use the tex button to test if you wrote it properly you know  and im not solving absolutely fucking anything with determinants miss me with that lengthy shit
i feel like a5 probably had a really short slick solution but im too brainlet to find it
  thanks    3 determine the greatest possible value of eqnsum_i110 cos3x_i/eqn for real numbers mathx_1 x_2   x_10/math satisfying eqnsum_i110 cosx_i0/eqn  4 let m and n be positive integers wtih gcdmn1 and let eqna_kleft lfloormk/nright rfloor  left lfloormk1/nright rfloor/eqn for k  1 2  n suppose that g and h are elements in a group g and that mathgha1gha2ghane/math where e is the identity element show that ghhg  note mathleft lfloorxright rfloor /math means the greatest integer less than or equal to x
5 let f r  r be an infinitely differentiable function satisfying f00 f11 and fx0 for all x in r show that there exists a positive integer n and a real number x such that mathfnx0/math  6 suppose that a b c and d are distinct points no three of which lie on a line in the euclidean plane show that if the squares of the length of the line segments ab ac ad bc bd and cd are rational numbers then the quotient eqnareabigtriangleup abc)))/areabigtriangleup abd)))/eqn is a rational number    and thats all folks
math fracab /math
redoing the first ones    1 find all ordered pairs a b of positive integers for which  eqn1/a1/b3/2018/eqn  2 let maths_1 s_2 dots  s_2n1/math be the nonempty subsets of math1 2 dots n/math in some order and let m be the math2n1  2n1/math matrix whose i j entry is a piecewise function  sorry dont know how to do a piecewise function here  fx  if maths_i cap s_j  emptyset /math x0  otherwise x1
  3  pffffffffff  why is this one so ridiculously easier than the rest
  a3 was a joke even i got it and im a brainlet
okay time for the b set    1 let p be the set of vectors defined by eqnp  fracab  0  a  2  0  b  100 and ab in z/eqn find all vectors v in p such that the set pv obtained by omitting vector v from p can be partitioned into two sets of equal size and equal sum  2 let n be a positive integer and let eqnf_n z  n  n1zn2z2zn1 /eqn prove that mathf_n/math has no roots in the closed unit disk math  z in c z1  /math
i liked the b set a whole lot more than a b5 if i did it right was especially nice
3 find all positive integers mathn10100/math for which simultaneously n divides math2n/math n1 divides math2n1/math and n2 divides math2n2/math  4 given a real number a we define a sequence by mathx_01 x_1x_2a/math and mathx_n12x_nx_n1x_n2/math for n  2 prove that if mathx_n0/math for some n then the sequence is periodic
  prove it i found it way easier than 1 simply 1009 2018 and 2018 1009
    1 let ab a solution then  eqn3ab  2018ab/eqn  note that the prime factorization of 2018 is 21009  wlog we may assume that 1009 divides a  write matha  1009a/math   then math3ab  21009ab/math and therefore math3a2b  2018a/math  hence matha/math divides mathb/math and we write mathb  ab/math and deduce math3a2b  2018/math  examining the divisors of 2018 mod 3 we find math3a2 in 1 1009/math and therefore either matha  1 b  2018/math or matha  337 b  2/math  finally the solutions with matha/math divisible by 1009 are math1009 2018/math and math340033 674/math and the other solutions are math2018 1009/math and math674 340033/math
  simply 1009 2018 and 2018 1009  but thats very wrong  for example 6732018673 is another solution
  b5 was slick but i was too much of a brainlet to get it    5 let mathff_1 f_2/math be a function from mathr2/math to mathr2/math with continuous partial derivatives mathfracpartial f_ipartial x_j/math that are positive everywhere suppose that eqnfracpartial f_1partial x_1fracpartial f_2partial x_2  frac14  fracpartial f_1partial x_2fracpartial f_2partial x_1 2  0 /eqn  everywhere prove that f is onetoone  6 let s be the set of sequences of length 2018 whose terms are in the set math12345610/math and sum to 3860 prove that the cardinality of s is at most eqn23860 frac201820482018 /eqn
  matha/math does not need to divide mathb/math when matha/math is even you have to account for that case which can lead to math673 6732018/math
  sorry im still brain fried i meant to reply asking about question 3 because i found proof of a1 fairly easy and linear
  yeah b had nicer problems i didnt make much progress on many of them but at least there was no ass cancer on the level of a2 or a4
  tfw i spent 30 minutes factoring 1009 to make sure it was prime  tfw i still missed the 674 solution
  i never understood why people like doing these contests  its like the problem board sits down and drafts up a list of the most asinine problems they can possibly imagine fucking look at 6 jesus
  my class had this as our final if we showed up we got a 100 for the classs final regardless of our putnam exam
  lowell
  thanks i tried to repost but for some reason it just wont work
  how the fuck were you supposed to attack a4
  mk/nmk1/nm/n duh  rest is babby tier  actually the whole question is babby tier when you in fact try to solve it i was wrong about 3
i fucked all the ones i submitted and i was on our schools team l  lmao
  not quite the floor function fucks it up  if m3 and n2  then floor mk/n   floor mk1/n  alternates between 2 and 3 it isnt 25  fractional powers are necessarily defined on a generic group
arent
  floor  fuck didnt see that
  did you need any significant result from complex analysis to tackle b2 i havent taken an actual complex analysis course but ive been trying to selfteach
  no
  math10100/math  these test writers are hecking trolls i tell you
  a3 is 6 right
my class had this as our final as well did well enough in the rest of the course but the putnam itself was rough    a session the one problem i was able to write up a proof for was a2 but i still screwed up somewhere and got a wrong answer and cant for the life of me figure out where the error was    b session i spent an hour on before realizing that i was going nowhere then spent an hour on b1 before realizing that id gone in a circle to prove something trivial after that the hamster kinda fell off the wheel so i turned in an empty envelope and left half an hour early
  the best i got was 9 using 9 of the 10 variables three sets of 0 2π/3 2π/3 but with the last variable unaccounted for i wasnt able to prove whether or not there was something more optimal with the time i had left
  tfw you look at a6 and think about using herons formula for a first attempt but forget what herons formula actually was
  i used herons formula on a6 it was a fucking nightmare so many square roots
    i got 0  by using demoivres with n  3 i got    mathcos3x  4cos3x  3cos x   sum_i110cos3x_i  4sum_i110 cos3x_i  3sum_i110cos x_i   sum_i110cos3x_i  4sum_i110 cos3x_i  4sum_i110 cos x_i 1sin2 x_i leq 4sum_i110 cos x_i  0/math    and by setting half the numbers to 0 and the other half to pi/2 i got that it definitely hits this max    i dont think three sets of 0 2π/3 2π/3 with some other number would work because the final number would have to be such that cosx  1/2
  sorry meant to say that cosx would have to equal 3/2 for the final number
    the set i had was 0 0 0 2π/3 2π/3 2π/3 2π/3 2π/3 2π/3 π/2  eqncos01 cos2pi/31/2 cospi/20 sum limits_i110 cosx_i  0  cos01 cos2pi1 cos3pi/20 sum limits_i110 cos3x_i  9/eqn  again not sure if its optimal or not
  you can get 9 by letting 3 terms be 1 6 terms be 1/2 and 1 term be zero  i dont think 9 is optimal though  i let cosx_i  c_i where 1  c_i  1  then i tried to maximize sum 4c_i3  using lagrange multipliers this only tells you that if the solution is on the interior of 1110 c_i is either a or a which obviously doesnt work  you find that the solution must be somewhere on the boundary of 1110  choose an arbitrary number of the c_i to be 1 or 1 and assume the rest are in 11  after reducing the dimension of the problem lagrange multipliers should work  the problem is finding out how many of the c_i are 1 and 1 then finding how many of the rest are a and a after reducing the dimension
  i can get 1240/49  97959 by letting 3 terms be 1 and 7 terms be 3/7  i think this is optimal
    write m/n  n  r/n where nfloorm/n and r  mnn  a_k  n  floorrk/n  floorrk1/n  which equals n if rk1rk doesnt contain a multiple of n  and equals n1 if rk1rk contains a multiple of n
  6a    let a00 b0b cxcyc  dxdyd  b isnt 0 since a and b are distinct  xc isnt 0 xd isnt 0 from colinear requirement  using cross product or baseheight the ratio of areas is bxc/2/bxd/2xc/xd    b2  xc2  yc2  xd2  yd2  xc2  yc2  b2  2byc  xd2  yd2  b2  2byd  xc2  yc2  xd2  yd2 2xcxdycyd  are all rational from the square of the lengths requirement  the last three give  byc  byd  xcxd  ycyd  are all rational  the cleverness is to multiply things by b2  xcxd  ycydb2 is rational   xcxdb2  bycbyd is rational  this gives xcxdb2 is rational which gives xcxd is rational    xd2b2  yd2b2 is rational   xd2b2  bydbyd is rational  which gives xd2b2 is rational  which gives xd2 is rational    xcxd/xd2  xc/xd is rational    not really to much thinking involved just a lot of writing the formulas out you dont even need to know that acd and bcd arent lines

if i got even 1 point on that fucking test ill be thrilled
  how would you go at a5
    which uni
detailed video walkthrough knowing the prime factorization of 2018 before taking the test helps     
  its kind of bullshit when they write problems like this where your only options are to either cross your fingers and pray its prime or check like a dozen divisors to make sure they arent trolling you
if i power through studying 8 hours a day for a while will i eventually get used to it or will it always be hell im trying to not be a brainlet
it gets better desu but 8 hours a day 7 days a week is unsustainable
  why people work 8 hours a day
  why people work 8 hours a day  people work 8 hours a day  if you try doing that consistently youll find yourself idling after the first few hours  aim for 4 with 15 min pauses per hour
  no the whole fucking week    besides people is forced to work pretty sad while nobody is forcing you to study    so nah cant be done
  aim for 4 with 15 min pauses per hour  thats what im doing i wasnt suggesting 8 hours straight
unless youre doing some memorization bullshit like med school youre not gonna need to do 8 hours of straight studying anyways unless its homework or problem solving in which case just work until its done
why do you need to study 8hours/day  what are studying 
  with plenty of breaks your mind would wander like fuck going 8 hours a day everyday and youd start to resent studying
      i want to get out of brainlet tier
  i want to get out of brainlet tier  then it is going to be even more difficult
  8 hours a day isnt going to do that itll just make you depressed and anxious while you waste your golden years
  youll get used to it    i got used to it but then i got burned out and i had to take a break
  why settle for 8hours go for 14h if you want to catch up to big brains  started 7days ago with 168minutes of pure studystretched it through whole day almost doubled it yesterday with 310mins which is something like 8h normie standard for 45min study15break aiming to study 80100h a week  theres no point in power though study until you are grasping the subject then take a break theres no point in blank staring at paper   what i recommend from my experience is to limit your dopamine set goals and reward yourself after like no 4chan until 8h studied youtube video games etc keep it serious and take care of your health godspeed
is there really a scientific consensus on global warming and how does it relate to this    
is there really a scientific consensus on global warming  there cant be a scientific consensus on pseudoscience
  no there is a lot of speculation and hypothesis nothing more heres the thing the weather has always changed ie ice age it has nothing to do with man as much as it has to do with the earth going through natural phases of influx of heating and cooling    now with that being said to say that this wont affect us greatly would be to ignore common sense with that being said there are probably too many people on this earth anyways and our consumption culture is only aiding in our demise at the very least it certainly isnt sustainable
there is a very clear consensus on global warming like any good hypothesis global warming is backed by 1 empirical proof data that shows the mean global temperature increasing over the last hundred years post industrial revolution 2 a proven mechanism to explain the phenomenon greenhouse effect and 3 scientific experiments to match the mechanism with the data the scientific community has broadly accepted that humans are the root cause of climate change due to our carbon emissions anybody who says otherwise is incorrect its really not hard to find this stuff out
   ferrara   of entitlement and budget policy for the heartland institute  l0lno
  the weather has always changed  on geological timescales not in the space of 80 years you dumbcunt
nice shill thread
  we only have a sample period dating back to the past 200 years thats it n80 is nothing beyond that all you have are proxies such as tree ring and soil samples which are shittier and vary as much as /15c and influenced by other things weather pathogens sunshine hours essentially the temperature data beyond instrumentation began is what the researchers want it to be and is entirely unverifiable youre a low iq moron
  dumb burger
  dunning kruger the post
  seems more intelligent than your lack of a counterargument and ad hominem attack
  counter arguments have been posted countless times now its time for ad hominem you retarded piece of shit
  yyou must be stupid bbecause only stupid people refuse to accept the validity of manmade climate change ha dunningkruger effect morty i win  cringe
  with that being said you have to do more for your 50 cent
      your ideology is stupid and dangerous faggot
  shill is a dumb frogposter  you cant make this shit up
  
  yes totally natural just ignore that the natural circle says we should be slowly cooling over the next 10000 years not warming and that current warming is an order of magnitude faster than those natural warming phases you mentioned    hahahahaha it never gets old
  how do i buy temperatureanomoly coins
  it will crash hard the price is clearly being manipulated
  pamp it
a blog from an american financial newsletter website  i mean come on
    
    i clicked on the authors name   peter ferrara  director of entitlement and budget policy for the heartland institute   senior advisor for entitlement reform and budget policy at the national tax limitation foundation  worked in the white house under presidents raegan and bush    gee do you think this guy might be a little bit biased
  yes totally natural just ignore that we have directly measured the amount of heat being radiated back to earth by co2 in the atmosphere and therefore we know the warming is being caused by man
  see 
    
  no theyre only biased if i dont like their opinions
  see 
the science is very solid on this topic there is little meaningful ambiguity anthropogenic climate change is real and probably one of the biggest issues of our time
  the science is settled  its real and is the biggest issue of our time
  glad you agree
  
look at this graph
  wait till you see the
  oh no no no
  ahahahahahahahahahahaha
the retardation in this thread is off the charts    you all need to go back
      ice core data ends in mid 1800s see  for the temperature spike
  this angers the climate shill
newspaper lied pretty obvious you can watch potholer54 videos if you want to understand the subject better
  a proven mechanism to explain the phenomenon  anyone else see the problem here
  reddit the post
freaking the issue as consensus is not the question there was once a consensus that the earth was the center of the universe it should be about evidence but all data points to poor modeling around correlated datasets but doesnt have a good model for causality  sure they can point to co2 but why do they stop there we have also been increasing our electrical potential since then as well how do they know its not the emf causing climate instability on top of that why do they keep getting predictions wrong on the impact  the point of science is to make models of prediction for duplication
  /thread
wow did they open a new budget for climate shitposting how much can you make
  is there really a scientific consensus on global warming  yes the vast majority of peerreviewed publications the discuss the issue conclude that the current warming trend is both real and caused by human activity    and how does it relate to this  thats complete garbage    forbes  heartland  the hiatus  do you really expect anyone on /sci/ to buy that kind of bullshit propaganda the entire article is a sequence of of lies and heavily distorted claims it covers the whole spectrum from using uncorrected rss data to lying about global cooling claims    heres what rss data actually looks like
  freaking the issue as consensus is not the question  consensus is a perfectly reasonable tool for nonexperts to collect the conclusions of a group of experts    it should be about evidence but all data points to poor modeling around correlated datasets  modelling isnt even nessisary to identify and measure agw the models are to try and make accurate predictions about the future  also what data points to poor modelling the existing models have done very well at predicting surface temperature trends    doesnt have a good model for causality  thats the greenhouse effect you might want to read about it    sure they can point to co2 but why do they stop there  because its by far the largest human impact    we have also been increasing our electrical potential since then as well how do they know its not the emf causing climate instability  because theres neither a proposed mechanism nor any evidence theyre connected    on top of that why do they keep getting predictions wrong on the impact  what predictions have they made that have turned out to be wrong
  you are a retard
  yyoure a shill dumb ad hominem cant make this up morty i win
  you forgot the frog
  its an invasion of paid shills /pol/ doesnt care enough to come here to troll about climate change
  no
  is there consensus on how much is due to human activity versus how much is due to natural processes also is there a consensus on the consequences of the expected degree of climate change is there even a consensus as to the degree of climate change that will happen or is the consensus on nothing more than the climate is changing to some degree and some percentage that we cant determine is caused by humans
  all of those things were debated decades ago
  with that being said  a bunch of people in america especially in the grain growing midwest actually benefit from the minor climate shifts theyve experienced longer growing seasons milder winters with more precipitation help the corn grow   this effects all sorts of policy decisions and research
  sure there is a scientific consensus on global warming goy  anyone who says otherwise is drummed out of academia and regarded as a pariah  perfectly legitimate consensus goy  just like there is a scientific consensus that all races are totally equal  just like there will soon be a nearunanimous scientific consensus that gender is nothing more than a social construct that can be changed at will
     meme    you could feed the entire population of earth for 20142 years at current food production levels on a dietary budget of 1500 to 2000 calories a day    the problem is one of economics brainlet youve fallen for the embarrassed millionaire trap

hey guys i dont usually post here but i need some help    the only thing missing in my scientific article is a image like this one  what program you guys use to make shit like this  please help
ofc im not talking about the feg microscopy im refering to the laser experiment stuff on the left

what should i look for when searching for a telescope
  light
  the sun
  bigger aperture is better but it also decreases the portability which probably will result it the scope not being used start with a 8inch reflector telescope on a dobsonian mount
  do you have a particular brand you would recommend in terms of affordability
  either skywatcher or celestron they are the two biggest brands
  they all suck you need to  so i suggest you start by learning how to blow glass
  how to blow glass  nah just buy a bunch of glass bowls on a flea market and melt them down into two discs in a furnace and rub them against each other for a while    
  good grief that is such an openended question   are you familiar with the sky already   what type of objects to you think you want to see or expect to see   what sort of a budget are you looking at   any expectation of photography   how dark is your sky  is it easy to travel an hour to get to a darksky site   do you even know what types telescope configurations are availableand do you have a clue which you want   what inspired you to decide to buy one   have you looked through any instruments say at a local star party   look up ideas on web sites dedicated to giving advice before coming to this sketchy place      add to the list meade
    look for a good website that recommends different kinds of telescopes
  8 inch  telescopelet
ive got 90mm refractor and i think i saw a crater on the moon once
bought a 100 telescope and the only good thing i can look at is the moon the rest of the stars are just as small as when you look at them with your eyes
  nothing that looks like your pic thats a cheap toy you want a dobsonian ive got an 8 skywatcher something like that  also just fyi astronomy is cool but some beginners are disappointed that you wont get close to the quality you see in pictures mars is basically a blurry reddish orange circle
  how to find a good telsscope the guide      go on craigslist for the nearest big city  search telescope  get the cheapest damn scope that works you can find  look at the moon and planets be impressed  feel the need to upgrade to zoom in on them more  realize that you will also be able to see galaxies and shit if you upgrade  go on craigslist again  refresh search for telescope every few days until you find a bargain dont worry by the time one will show up you will already have developed a natural intrest and done the research on your own out of sheer interest    t done it myself eventually found a ten incher orion dobsonian for 300
  depends on what you want to see but generally speaking you want large aperture and long focal length
  you really cant see galaxies without doing astrophotography which requires a startracker mount
  white dots
  not op but what would i need to be able to see saturns rings  what about our local group could i look at a galaxy and say yeah thats a galaxy
  you can make out saturns rings and maybe the cassini division with a 4inch telescope but it will be tiny  resolving galaxies really requires photographing with a long exposure so you need a tracking mount with tracking you can get excellent photographs of andromeda galaxy with normal camera and 200mm lens but without long exposures its very dim looking like little more than a faint white fuzzy area
  fpbp
  i guess the same long exposure technique with the planets would look amazing    i watched this video and know i think i might just buy a decent pair of binoculars first  
  dude shut the fuck up    no one is doing any of this gay shit
should i buy this      yes i can transport it and where i live the night sky is crystal clear i can see satellites and shooting stars with my naked eye
  not him and havent done much astrophotography but no i dont think long exposures on planets would result in better photos long exposures help with dim objects like galaxies and some nebula but it isnt a magic fix all the visible planets are actually pretty bright on their own so if anything a long exposure will wash out any detail you can see just from live viewings if anything youd want a fast exposure
  i see thanks
  subtract meade from the list  it is chinesium shit completely useless they are direct skywatcher copies with bad materials and imprecise work some of them can be made usable by a lot of tedious work but will never be as good as a skywatcher set up right and it is not that much cheap either    t ex owner of meade shit
just point your camera at the sky
  startracker mount  equatorial mount
  i have seen the big dipper galaxies in visual on a cheapskate 120 skywatcher
  to get really good pictures of planets you dont need a long exposure as  said the planets are plenty bright on their own but you do need many individual images that are then stacked together see registax and autostakkert    equatorial mount  yes but the important thing is it be a motorized mount that can compensate for the earths rotation otherwise youll never get a long exposure shot without streaking

what are you currently studying /sci/ first year maths undergrad here taking babby linear algebra
  functional analysis italybro but ive been busy so literally no progress
  pure mathematics and mathematical physics third year its really intense and ive been failing my rings and fields module lately feels bad but i really cant get my head around a lot of the concepts and explanations of different theorems and definitions are not easily found at least its really interesting and im okay at most of the stuff in the course
  why did you misspell baby
is linear algebra after calc 1  2  and 3 or before
  usually taken with calc 2    its on purpose
  well finite dimensional vector spaces are independent of algorithmic onedimensional real analysis however algorithmic multidimensional real analysis might depend on finite dimensional vector spaces to be able to simplify quite a lot
  dont know about the calc thing here in italy take linear algebra along with real analysis
  why
automata theory and formal languages  this is too much abstraction for my tastes i want off mr turings wild ride      my uni has cs students take la on its own after/during calc2 math students take a diffeqsla course im not sure what the difference is in the la portions as we didnt do anything particularly computer sciency in there the math one is probably the same with diffeqs tacked on you dont need calc to do it though its just conventions they should teach it in high school though its a lot more visual and engaging than calc 1 imo

  woah me too
  its called being antisocial enough to rely on injokes and memes as validation of group inclusion memes are supposed to be cope not necessarily funny
  explain to me how social people dont do the exact same thing  omg did you see deadpool 2 yet  sooo funny  its just different jokes
  hey italianon where are you from
  im studying in pavia
could i just make a bunch of lipid and fat metabolism signal peptides/hormone and inject them to stimulate fat breakdown
bump
  isnt that what dnp does increase your metabolism so much that you burn fat just by standing around it also happens to be extremely dangerous turns out increasing your metabolism can overheat your body leading to irreversible brain damage also death
  you could just deplete your liver glycogen and keep a low insulin level to stay in nutritional ketosis lay off the sugar and starch fatty
  yeah but thats not as fun nor as potentially profitable
ever feel like your field isnt going much of anywhere and if you stick with it you might regret it even though you kinda like it    t organic chemistry fag
are you still in school you might feel like its stagnant because your school is only going to be teaching you old stuff that has already been researched and confirmed you arent going to be actually looking at cutting edge stuff until you start doing actual new research
ive felt that way about my life
    undergrad but in a research lab and taking graduate level courses im familiar with a lot of the cutting edge stuff it just sort of seems like a matured field everything can be made so work goes into making more compact or efficient synthesis for whatever its useful but not novel in a way in that the ultimate point is improving efficiency and cost the more revolutionary stuff will come from biochem it seems like

millimeter waves are bad for humans likely lethal for smaller animals unfortunately unlike existing technologies which are no better see  data on millimeter waves is comparatively sparse but there are some clear trends    the primary mechanism for existing microwave systems is increased free radical generation changes in gene expression and altered calcium flux its not known if millimeter waves work precisely the same way but it is known  the structure of human sweat glands is a helical coil when filled with sweat a conductive salt solution it turns out this is a quite functional antenna array for millimeter waves  once in the body attenuation is very low according to ussr literature millimeter waves propagate almost freely through the extracellular space preserving in particular their information content structures in the body are capable of demodulating these signals  the structure of the plasma membrane changes in response and maintains this change long after irradiation has ceased  it changes the structure of the skin alters the blood alters bone marrow and lymphatic function cripples the immune system prevents the production of vitamin d and demyelinates nerves as well as rendering their axons fragmented yes it strips off the insulation and chops up the wires this was known decades ago you can expect destruction of peripheral nerves and spinal ganglia    recently birds died in an area where 5g was being tested i believe in the netherlands ive been meaning to verify this more thoroughly but from what i know it doesnt surprise me they died by the hundreds their bodies looked pristine the cause of death was internal hemorrhaging      sources below
          in this link look at studies in soviet science pathological effects of radio wavespdf  read the section on low intensity millimeter waves the other books in there are also informative    and    
  why do threads around this topic get deleted /10176045/ just got removed after i wrote a proper reply with quotes from scientific papers around the topic of emf intensity/proximity and observed effects on lab animals
    you realize that a normal house lamp produces more energy than 5g 
  why do threads around this topic get deleted    there is part of your answer people in /sci/ doesnt even understand that the issue is not about energy but also about frequency
so what should i do personally
    frequency does not cause cancer energy does and frequency is linked to energy inevitably in em waves
  as far as we know ionizing radiation is the main mechanism that interacts with biological functions 5g isnt enough energy to interact your cells are damaged more by 10 minutes in the sun and by radical oxygen than by sitting next to a 5g source for years    its just like the claims of powerlines causing cancer in livestock theres no explainable mechanism that would cause it using em theory its x tier voodoo which is why it gets deleted
  that would mean you are dead just accept the fact that different frequency acts differently on different thing its going trough
  its well studied that 630850 nm of light has several absorption peaks with regards to i think cytochrome c producing a variety of beneficial effects so your first statement is wrong its not thermal either look up lllt/red light therapy/dr michael hamblin/photobiomodulation
  scientific papers    like these post if you have them ive not gone over these fully and havent double checked to see if they are still valid urls        literature sources                      historical reviews symposium proceedings etc       irreversible infertility      general theory      in vivo dna damage in humans      behavioral changes with prenatal exposure  
  why do threads around this topic get deleted /10176045/ just got removed    because it was a shit thread with a shit starting op that alone can make all the difference
  i think we dont absorb waves of that lenght
so now /sci/ has tooker and this emf spook i wonder whos next to come shit up our board
  well at least flat earthers gave it a break
    flat earthers also dont have a bucket load of peer reviewed science papers to back them up either
  science papers  oh fuck off back to /g/ i remember you
  why do threads around this topic get deleted  because youre a nutter
  while i have heard the same thing i wonder  you mention radiation and exposure to sunlight but some people and animals have an increased susceptibility to sun rays like some medication will cause a photosensitivity  while there doesnt seem to be much of an explanation people find that they are aversly affected by wifi and radio signals think it causes headaches or something  also not that in some form of psychosis and some psych meds can cause a hypersensitivity to sound     so while im not totally disputing current understanding of radiation and shortwave em  i wonder if there are any special cases where a person might become susceptible to said wavelengths
  as far as we know ionizing radiation is the main mechanism that interacts with biological functions  this is the core misconception and i think people dont realize that this argument has already played out well over 50 years ago skepticism over nonthermal effects for researchers who could accept what they were seeing the kt paradox ie how can a periodic signal or continuous wave in some cases well below the threshold of ambient thermal noise affect the behavior of cells the answer is polarization and structures designed to be resistant to random thermal noise but very sensitive to other stimuli like the calcium channels voltage sensor cells operate using nonionizing radiation for signalling anyway which is why periodic signals with a rapid rise time pulses used for digital communication can be so active    i dont have a lot of time at the moment refer to    with the move to pulsed radiation much of the variation in reported phenomena and specific effects calcium efflux from membrane bound glycoproteins action on adenylate cyclase etc gave way to more generally consistent effects refer to the work of carl blackman sm bawin phllips and wr adey for more about the former as well as the authors in the who sponsored warsaw symposium included in the mediafire link bawins last paper on 1hz magnetic fields particularly which demonstrated the mere presence of no in a chelated form in the extracellular space is enough to facilitate transduction the cell seemingly does not need to be capable of manufacturing it unfortunately either something happened or she never secured further funding because the plans for future research she mentioned arent indexed anywhere and probably didnt happen    for epidemiology which i havent really included refer to the work of bruce hocking lennart hardell samuel milham and others    i noticed the warsaw symposium was missing some pages so im reuploading it will take a bit

  goes on about smart meters the evils of processed food and how hes so unique among sheep              gets told hes nuts by a doctor      this speaks for itself    im a special warrior pls stroke my ego      this entire thread is him wigging out about how hes totally not insane and the evils of shrinks      him going on about his genius again        protip dont constantly call people myopic if you want to remain anon  muh jaw problems muh nerve probems      spends half a thread freaking out about muh jaw muh super healing muh logic and ct scans plus some of his wacky medical adventures      hes some sort of genius philosopher      arguing with doctors again since they dont agree with his self diagnosis      muh logical framework cures acne      all caps rage about how stoic he is and how you dont see him doing exactly what his post says      neurosurgeon pro
  more mental issues      whining about neuralgia again admits that he feels mentally impaired      sperging out in /med/ general about how the who is lying        hes a chemtrail conspiracy theorist too      5g is an anti overpopulation killswitch      admits that hes given himself brain damage with drugs    admits that hes a sperg with a bias against phone users      probably chemtrail conspiracy theorist      natural health word salad
  ive gone through some of this posters walls of links in the past and often 1/2 arent me which is an unacceptably high error rate more likely all that really counts is framing and establishing a core narrative
  sperg more lmao
  i dont go to /g/ and this thread already has a ton of posts with such papers read them what is wrong with you      theres more than one person posting that stuff fyi
  it wouldnt surprise me everyone though mobile phones were totally safe and anyone who talked about the radiofrequency radiation was called a conspiracy theorist    fast forward to right now and we have linked a certain type of breast cancer to women who put their phones inside their bras im a nurse at a public hospital and we have a little sign at the reception informing women not to store their phones against their breasts
  im a nurse
being this retarded  
hello antiradiowave poster what do you think about lllt i posted  its really a promising technology/technique and is basically part of the same phenomenon as your cause although positive in this case
  hello sir what ails you     i work in critical care its a very rewarding but emotionally challenging job if you ever find yourself on deaths doorstep ill be the one to make sure you dont go through that door 
  ill be the one to make sure you dont go through that door   nah brah its fine
  why call people retarded this is /sci/  science and math bringing more evidence to the table helps a lot that is what you sorta did so thats a positive dont tarnish your contribution by calling people retarded      got a pic of that sign to post try not to get anything else identifiable around it or edit that out later prior to posting
  how do you deal with too many cooks in the kitchen that happens a lot in the local hospital here and it makes everything confusing information gets completely lost or gets to the physician too late
  nothing wrong with calling someone retarded that its just accurate
  it belittles you
  you prefer the newspeak person with special needs
  you misunderstand the slur whatever it may be belittles you and what information you present because you presented it in an offensive way
  retarded is a slur  not a term describing a specific condition  not sure if you arent just lowkey triggered right now
  i dont see what you mean
  well maybe ill give you some time to catch up
        now that everyone has seen what type of person posted  we can safely say that snopes is a website for retards which is quite a tragic irony
crossthread post relevant to the topic    
  a website which creates retards ftfy    its not that theyre bad fact checkers simply bought off and completely onesided on various controversial politically sensitive topics
yeah theyre slowly killing us and what are you going to do about it
  its not that theyre bad fact checkers  they are though i lost all faith in them when i debunked something for them and they took the credit
are conceptual breakthroughs always done by individuals
are corporations people
    yeah no
  respectively
  stop using my name i might kill your family for it later its more likely than not    when i was in boot camp for the marines the drill instructors would say that if they learn your name real quick its because youre fucking up and if they dont quickly learn your name then youre doing well with you i will remember later to search for the people who mocked me in this fashion yes maybe you have nsa authentic anon software but nsa is my vassal org and their data is mine even while satans rebellion prevents me from accessing it today
    numbers    yes they did quickly learn name due my gimpy gait that resulted from helene raping me in the ass with a thermometer to rearrange my guts and then never putting me into physical therapy to repair the damage i honestly tried to be a good marine but by the time i left boocamp i already had the shitbird label because because i could not march smoothly
  does that mean youre fucking up because i leaned your name so quickly on a serialized bodypillow knitting cult

stats has got me down    i need to determine if there is a significant difference between life expectancy of the former eastern and western bloc countries during the years of communism    i made an anova table using romania as the point of comparison  the model is significant so im told but i need to determine what countries will be significantly different from romania somehow this will answer the above question  can anyone remind me how to determine which countries are significantly different based on the table  any assistance would be appreciated
first off if you are doing stats why arent you using r     second i am not sure i completely understand what youre asking wouldnt just looking at the pvalues answer your question

anybody else realize what you are doing isnt something you want to do a year or two after graduating undergrad and applied to med school    im working as a lab tech right now at the university im going to start a biophysics phd however im not enjoying the lab environment and starting to realize maybe research isnt for me i was thinking of applying to pa or med school but idk how to make the transition i would try to do a postbacc since i had a 34 and missing some prerequisites i also dont know how to contact my past mentors and say i completely abandoned what i said i was going to do and keep asking them for letters of recommendation i wouldnt be able to use my current pi as a reference since he will probably be pissed the school in general may not like it that i withdrew my acceptance will that look bad in future applications     in addition i have no experience working in a hospital but am planning to shadow a doctor on the weekends would that be enough to get into a postbacc    idk if its to late for me would like to hear if anyone had a similar experience  end blog post   inb4 asking sci
  personally i hate health care and i hate people im a pharmacist i went into pharmacy for the money and lax job its pretty good

  i had a bili of 4000 once  not compatible with life though that patient died
should i try to get into psychiatry or be a general practitioner i cant really decide and i was wondering what are pro/cont of both
ill post this one more time im in medschool but its an undergrad course my knowledge of chemistry biology and physics is at highschool level or worse so far that hasnt presented a problem because most of the microbiology pathology and pharmacology courses that the school im in has require rote memorization with little understanding would you recommend that i study chemistry biology and physics at my own time up to an undergrad level so that i could achieve a deeper understanding of other subjects
  if you want it would probably help in the long run having a solid graps of the causes helps you cure the effects but realize that it wont help with exams and such

why would someone choose to study chemistry  whats it like to be a chemistry major    if someone wants to learn about how the universe functions they study physics and if they want to learn about living processes and beings they study biology  chemistry always feels left out and frankly seems quite boring chemfags what do you even do and what pushed you to study chemistry instead of something else
  its for otherwise intelligent people who suck at maths
  he doesnt realize chemistry is the study of matter and is closely related to physics
  thats one of my questions what pushes people to study chemistry instead of physics
  unwillingness to deal with long as shit physics formulae i guess
  because group theory is so fun
  but among math physics and chem the latter is definitely the science that requires you to learn the most things by heart so its more tedious
  because physics is mainly the study of forces and energy in the broad sense whereas chemistry is the study of the composition and properties of matter for instance what is the chemical formula of a compound and what can we learn about its chemical and physical properties it is a highly experimental science
  chemistry is literally all memorization
  im an ee major but only someone who doesnt know chemistry would say this chemistry relies on experiment and intuition regarding qulatitative properties there might be less math than physics but it is not just memorization
i liked gen chem then of the upper division courses i liked pchem most i liked quantum theories of molecules and shiet the rest inorganic anal etc was neat but not as interesting i couldve just done physics but yeah
what kind of chem is worth getting into nowadays i read that chem phds were struggling to find employment
its actually applicable
  physics is applicable  and theres an entire field of math called applied math
  i got into it because i had a penchant for solving organic synthesis puzzles and i unironically wanted to become competent at drug synthesis then i started learning about molecular orbital theory and i realized that organic chemistry was boring so i switched to inorganic so i could deal with higher angular momentum orbitals i started studying physical inorganic chemistry which sort of bridges between the theoretical and experimental sides of chemistry we make inorganic model compounds to obtain physical data ie spectra and then study those systems theoretically to better interpret the data/refine the theories applying these theories computationally doesnt really require deep knowledge of the math behind the theory but it exposed me to quantum chemistry so i took a class in it and i loved it it was at this point that i realized i should have studied physics         i feel like ive been scammed out of knowledge old chemistry texts were pretty deeply mathematical but the discipline seems to have purged all the quantitative elements to appease the biologists so now i have all this knowledge but i lack the math/cs skills needed to be a competitive researcher in any of the related fields im now fighting to learn some math/cs so i can become a quantum chemist    now as for why quantum chemistry is a good field if its basically an application of quantum physics quantum chemistry is an extremely practical branch of quantum theory the theories make predictions about physical properties that can be routinely tested with inexpensive experiments the theories are very useful and have applications in everything from mat sci to bio its mostly linear algebras which is the only kind of math i have ever been even moderately good at    all that is to say if you actually like chemistry its smart to get a physics degree if you like the qualitative side of chemistry or want to focus on organic get a biochem degree
  i studied chemistry and work in retail everyone else does similar is a teacher is in an office or is an academia welfare leech its not a good thing to study
  at least im not as bad as this guy
  what about developing weapons/bombs
  wrong video ment to have arial footage of the moab
  biochem has a lot of startups but if youre not that motivated the best you can do with a bs is qa  anything outside that field requires an ms or higher
  the problem is that the fields of research that are traditionally thought of as chemistry are sort of languishing but many fields that are essentially chemistry are flourishing under different names materials science and biochemistry are essentially chemistry for example and many of the researchers in both fields hold chemistry degrees the problem is that biologists are outcompeting organic chemists at delivering promising drug candidates and people are no longer really that interested in total synthesis so the jobs that look like chemistry ie that take place at a workplace with a desk like pic related no longer really have such a strong economic driving force     i think the world of pharmeceuticals would be better if medicinal chemists refocused their efforts on natural products rather than these de novosynthetic mutant molecules but until med chem steps up its game biology is just going to outcompete also the truth is that a lot of smart people are attracted to exciting new discoveries and biology just has more of those because its so much newer so i figure pharmaceutical companies are just getting more biological talent
  im already afraid of carcinogens in chemical research in high energy materials their carcinogens also explode
  who cares its better money and more interesting
  not really chemical development of new explosives is not that big an industry there are already countless good recipes for explosive chemicals i suspect that the bigger industry would be in engineering packages to fill with those explosives
  bullshit you cant pass more than organic 1 with memorization its just a crutch
bump
  to appease the biologists  dont blame biology for your lack of mathematical ability
  what kind of chem is worth getting into nowadays  materials science is better than any chem these days
  i blame biology for the lack of math in university chemistry curricula
need some some help from someone better than me i need to get a solution of hidrogen bromide and acetic acid i plan doing this by adding h2so4 0c to a cold sodium bromide and gaa solution low temp to avoid bromine formation i need help to find a way to get the hbr solution from the byproducts and leftover sulfuric acid
do masters in chemistry carry any weight in the professional world i can finish chemistry masters two years but idk if its worth doing instead of a phd
  go to pharmacy school or some other health field
  chemistry is basically just composed of a fuckload of different rules and properties that must be memorized
  biology has more fields that are heavily mathematical than chemistry though
  if you have the choice of a phd take it if you dont like it drop out after a year with your masters dont pay for an ms in chemistry
  coming from physics graduate student working in a chemistry lab is a lot more fun than working in a physics lab if youre not into vector calculus and theory chem is a very solid choice    also there is high demand for chemists
  they have a chem master in 5 year program and ive done three years equivalent currently in fourth year but i should graduate bio/chem dual major in four that extra year would net a masters    im former military and will have three years left of free tuition and housing stipend upon completion of my bachelors obviously time is money so i dont want to spend that extra year towards a masters or even other bachelors if its not necessary even if your education is free sometimes its not worth taking it
  either way the extra year will cost room and board a phd will cover that with a stipend so even if you waste another year getting a graduate degree youll still be earning 25k30k for the year   it is not free they are literally paying you to get it
  biology is outcompeting chemistry    i find that hard to believe tbqhwyf biology itself is struggling on the job market probably even more than chemistry
  are there similiar pictures for biology and physics
  is there any field cs doesnt count that isnt struggling in the job market
chemistry graduate here bs new jersey  if you live in nj or most east coast/northeast coast states then 100 do chemistry jobs here are abundant i literally get 510 emails and calls a day asking me to be a lab technician or associate chemist   as far as why i chose it i just like it its interesting i like science and this appealed to me the most bio was boring to me physics/math dont have any jobs outside of academia and i dont plan on going back to school for a higher degree in the near future and social science doesnt really count
     its from a series of youtube videos called map of scientific topic
  lab is more fun  definitely  high demand  no theres not
  but dont you get bored as fuck of being a technician do you just run analytical separations all day or what
  in my school biophysics was a separate degree from biology/biochemistry the most quantitative thing they usually do is enzyme kinetics chemistry has the whole p chem stream thermodynamics kinetics quantum chem theoretical chem my problem is that i had shit profs for thermo and kinetics who really dumbed it down and it left me stunted in p chem i really loved quantum and theoretical chem tho but my prof was a genius it was cool cause he dumbed down the exams enough that the average chem major could pass but he actually taught the full material inclass as a chemist its really impressive to watch somebody derive the equations for an entire field from memory on the board without looking at notes i take it this happens all the time in physics though
  the thing is that we have all these mathematical subfields but a lot of the time they get heavily dumbed down at the undergraduate level
it has more applications than being a physicist
  id like to see you take pchem
  so i meant more along the lines of why do a masters when i could just go straight for a phd at a better school my university rank is around 250 its just a local state public university i have a great gre score 94ile to go to a top 25 but maybe it is just better to spend the extra year at the literal who school and get my masters and try to enter the professional market from there i want to work with eletroactive polymers but i do believe i should get a professional level degree at some point and i dont know if phd vs msc matters at that point
  even organic is extremely difficult using memorization after a while sure you need to memorize name reactions but you need to do a lot of 3d rotations to predict the correct retrons and you need to understand how the reactions actually work to have a good idfea of whether or not theyd actually be applicable to a given transformation
  that is a pretty sweet set up my undergrad was in biology so i sort of feel your pain with the lack of mathematical training at that level one thing ill say is dont just look at biophysics for mathematical fields of biology there are a host of others even if the math used in some mostly comes from mathematical biophysics
    
  my school was not a sweet set up i graduated with the top gpa in my program and i am struggling through pchem/qchem textbooks to get to a point where i dont feel like im hopelessly behind
  why do a masters when i could just go straight for a phd  they literally give you your masters after your first year of a phd for no extra effort free of charge youre getting it regardless whether you like it or not  ranking/gre shit  none of that matters get research experience and talk to your professors  spend the extra year  youre the one kvetching about wasting time im telling you you can get it in a year    for fucks sake learn how graduate school works
  it was cool cause he dumbed down the exams enough that the average chem major could pass but he actually taught the full material inclass  you seem to think this was a pretty sweet set up which is what i was referring to also most chemists i know have limited maths skills so id say you probably arent that far behind
      thanks
    at the bachelors level there are a lot of qc and technician type jobs but theyre almost all temporary low paid with no benefits and have high turnover so many stories of miserable bs chemists out there a masters is supposed to be a little better but i havent heard how thats why i would always recommend if you did a chemistry major in undergrad do something else in grad/professional school
    yes and yes the pay starts low like 20/hr and most of it is contract work aka no benefits but 90 of the times they offer you permanent but for me who has no experience its better than most starting jobs for other majors you can get high paying jobs straight out if you apply to big companies women i graduated with this year makes 60000 starting at bristol myers squibb  the difference between a small company and a big company is night and day  my first job was miserable and i bared 6 months of it basically 8 hours of paperwork and hplc but my new job has plenty of instruments like 78 instruments xrf hplc gc ftir uvvis icp etc and things to do and the pay is substantially better more responsibilities and more experience to gain which for me it amazing  a masters is definitely better than a bachelors and i would recommend it if you can afford it no need to go 2 years of school further into debt when the pay raise isnt that substantial
  i really love chemistry as a field its just really cool  when i first started learning about chirality and bonding mechanics and molecular geometry it gave my brain an erection
  physics is much easier and therefore a lot more boring waves are pisseasy you can do kinematics in your sleep vectors and vector fields are baby shit all the actually fun parts of physics are covered in so much boring schlock   even then a lot of interesting stuff like thermo and electromechanics comes into play a lot more directly in the field of chemistry and you go a lot more in depth into it all    physics is like the middle ground between math and chem and manages to be less interesting than either one  honestly if youre not going to be a chemist you might as well just go for a degree in mathematics instead of physics itd ultimately be a lot more fulfilling
  supposedly a chemical engineering undergrad is employable right out of uni as long as you did summer internships
  biochem doesnt pay well though undergrads on internet forums say you need an ms or higher to find decent pay
    be chemistry student   doesnt know how to take a derivative  doesnt know how to code anything besides hello world     i love science  incapable of thought experiments as all of his knowledge is just memorization and mnemonic devices  ignores anything that doesnt have to do with his very narrow field of work  finds formulas and derivations an eye sore
  physics is boring  what the fuck are you talking about everything related to computational physics and particles is extremely interesting some areas of cmp plasma and quantum optics are really cool too
  projecting
  physics is much easier  you are literally retarded and should stop posting until you have taken more than engineertier physics classes
  why study chemistry instead of studying how to cure aging
  youd probably need to study both biochemistry and chemical engineering for something as big as that spoilerthats my ultimate goal/spoiler
can i dissolve bones with lye
  honestly its a good meme but the whole idea of curing aging is enormously unrealistic we are nowhere near something like that we are seriously nowhere near curing tinnitus dont you think its a bit dubious to be studying how to end aging before science has discovered why your ears ring after a loud concert
there is good evidence that existing genetic variants in the human population ie alleles affecting intelligence that are found today in the collective world population but not necessarily in a single person can be combined to produce a phenotype which is far beyond anything yet seen in human history this would not surprise an animal or plant breeder  experiments on corn cows chickens drosophila etc have shifted population means by many standard deviations relative to the original wild type    take the case of john von neumann widely regarded as one of the greatest intellects in the 20th century and a famous polymath he made fundamental contributions in mathematics physics nuclear weapons research computer architecture game theory and automata theory in addition to his abstract reasoning ability von neumann had formidable powers of mental calculation and a photographic memory in my opinion genotypes exist that correspond to phenotypes as far beyond von neumann as he was beyond a normal human    the quantitative argument for why there are many sds to be had from tuning genotypes is straightforward suppose variation in cognitive ability is 1 highly polygenic ie controlled by n loci where n is large such as 10k and 2 approximately linear note the additive heritability of g is larger than the nonadditive  part    then the population sd for the trait corresponds to an excess of roughly n1/2vpositivevalleles for simplicity we suppress dependence on minor allele frequency a genius like von neumann might be 6 sd so would have roughly 6n1/2 more positive alleles than the average person eg600 extra positive alleles if n  10k but there are roughly n1/2 sds in phenotype 100 sds in the case n  10k to be had by an individual who has essentially all of the n positive alleles as long as n1/2  6 there is ample extant variation for selection to act on to produce a type superior to any that has existed before
fuck greentext    the probability of producing a maximal type through random breeding is exponentially small in n and the historical human population is insufficient to have made this likely    the content of this basic calculation underlies the work of animal and plant breeders as leading population geneticist james crow of wisconsin wrote 14 the most extensive selection experiment at least the one that has continued for the longest time is the selection for oil and protein content in maize dudley 2007 these experiments began near the end of the nineteenth century and still continue there are now more than 100 generations of selection remarkably selection for high oil content and similarly but less strikingly selection for high protein continue to make progress there seems to be no diminishing of selectable variance in the population the effect of selection is enormous the difference in oil content between the high and low selected strains is some 32 times the original standard deviation     on the genetic architecture of intelligence and other  quantitative traits
accurate prediction of height from genome has already been accomplished identifying 10k positively associated loci  the author has already made a case that the genetic architecture of intelligence is similar to that of height  it is only a matter of time before enough genotypephenotype pairs are collected to perform a similar analysis on cognitive ability and identify the estimated 10k snps that explain the variance in iq after these are identified an optimized genotype could be discovered and implemented in human embryos via genetic engineering although the technology here will also have to advance to be able to edit 10k loci reliably

von neumann  good example considering the amount of neuroticism and predispositions towards mental instability that very often comes with extraordinary intelligence my guess is that such superhuman individuals will have just enough time to consume the finest anime and write down the complete theory of covert control of humanity by noumenal judeomasonic xenoreptiloids before offing themselves at the ripe old age of 16
  humans in the future will look like this and have an iq the same or higher

tfw i was born too early to have my genes edited as an embryo so i can be a chad with a 200 iq and am stuck with shit genes for life
  considering the amount of neuroticism and predispositions towards mental instability that very often comes with extraordinary intelligence  intelligent people have lower rates of depression suicide anxiety and mental illness high iq people are better at everything
  will have just enough time to consume the finest anime and write down the complete theory of covert control of humanity by noumenal judeomasonic xenoreptiloids    isnt that pretty much what that one bouncer with a super high iq does
  not only that but you will likely be killed so your genes cant ruin the gene pool anymore
  it will be more efficient to just make women attracted to manlets less resource intensive
man it sucks to be born before all this gene editing stuff actually takes off
gene editing in living patient is it possible or just a myth  viral vector
  intelligent people have lower rates of depression suicide anxiety and mental illness  citation needed
  the problem would be getting it to every cell in the body but even then a large portion of dna is for development take the development of the jaw its pretty much 90 determined by development in the womb and subsequently development during early childhood and puberty it would likely not be possible to get a larger/more developed jaw through gene surgery alone because development has already occurred its likely similar for intelligence take the major neuronal pruning that happens in early childhood and late puberty but the brain also has a degree of plasticity that the mandible does not
  statistical analysis    high iq is correlated with long lifespan
  please show me how youre going to edit polygenic traits and regulate gene expression and pleiotropy seamlessly once the mutant super soldier archons are born also have u considered that the public might chimp out because of this as its an existential threat to their whole way of life    too difficult and expensive    no genius is associated with depression and mental illness youre thinking of above average iq people not what op is positing     rigorous and convincing
  this could be due to the underlying architecture of corn in that it cannot be designed to be oil and protein heavy without becoming something other then corn selecting for something it is intended to be like starch and sugar content is something thats seen many magnitudes of gain from the original grasss it was bred from     under this context intelligence is something were already heavily predisposed to its arguably our most prominent feature so it follows that we can quite easily see significant gains in overall ability to the point that the people produced would overshadow the collective ability of the 20th century intellectuals
  it would be even more efficient and even less resource intensive to just replace women with artificial wombs and sexbots

  if they birth 10000 hypergeniuses when youre 40 theres a real chance theyll figure out how to somatically edit you to hypergenius by the time theyve hit 30 of course the question is if they would want to
  crispr isnt going to create super geniuses for a long time modifying anything more than single genes is too complicated and risky even if crispr has a success rate of 99 then doing it at hundreds of times in hundreds of cells of a single embryo will have an unacceptable risk for creating a mosaic that has severe abnormalities this presupposes you have a perfect understanding of which changes to make which for intelligence we do not  selection using polygenic scores is by far the better option and is already feasible and could produce 10 iq point gains right now and potentially multiple sd gains later   that said id like my future children to have some crispr alterations  eg apoe e2 for reduced alzheimers and apoa1 milano for lower cardiac disease

  the future looks bright
  this is unironically what is going to happen
  yes but a update is already being researched on
      gifted students do not report less life satisfaction  doesnt sound like high iq makes you depressed
    yeah this is a meme  the tortured genius a la a beautiful mind i think there may be some evidence that schizophrenia increases creativity or is associated with it but it occurs more often among people with lower iqs  at least hospital admissions do perhaps smart people with schizophrenia dont go to hospital or perhaps dumb people are misdiagnosed    
  for the last time as long as were destroying the mental abilities of children at birth and through their environment it wont matter what genes you have    the way theyre setting it up youre going to require in vitro fertilization to make children and who knows maybe theyll make your children just as sterile as you maybe theyll tweak their genes a bit to confine them to a certain tier of society this is not science fiction this is where were close to arriving
  eh we will have agi long before designer babies is a thing so honestly who cares about max human potential iq
  births you into a first world shithole that will make your mother lay flat during birth drug her with pitocin causing forceful contractions which actually make birthing harder and slam your head against her cervix repeatedly if cesarean section is now required they give her a spinal injection of an opioid when youre finally out of there they clamp your umbilical cord before placental transfer is complete depriving you of your blood supply before lung changeover is complete causing brain damage and depriving your of your iron stores they inject you with vitamin k further thickening your hypoxic blood theyll put vaseline in your eyes and wash you in a sink if they opioid caused your respiratory system to shut down youll be put in an incubator for a while they might next amputate parts of your genitals youll be vaccinated with things shown to be completely unnecessary and cause harm in humans finally youre back with your mother by some definition shes a smart savvy empowered woman and she knows how to think and who to trust this is a new world were making so she forgoes breast feeding and gives you onions infant formula the good stuff depriving you of her dhea anadamide antibodies or any of the other stuff you apparently dont need youll now drink fluoridated chlorinated brominated water full of post metabolic drugs and birth control pills youll be injected with more junk periodically your diet will consist of stuff thats food in name only a constant barrage of pesticides herbicides additives and heavy metals youll be exposed to wireless devices which cause brain damage which is likely worsened by the deprivation of your iron stores in infancy youll probably turn out autistic have autoimmunity digestive problems or another chronic illness like 50 of our children now
  genes give a high probable tendency for stuff though
  considering the amount of neuroticism and predispositions towards mental instability that very often comes with extraordinary intelligence  will this meme cope ever end
  where can i learn more about the first 2/3 of this post
  people with acromegaly grow their lower jaw until it is physically stopped there are sutire points in the skull that kinda act like closed growth plates you just have to find a way to reactivate the epiphyseal plates people are working on this
  brainlet answer
lee kwan yew and his wife were both top of their class at cambridge their son exceeded them both     iq is all inheritance
  their son exceeded them both  muh maffs degree  lee kwan yew hasnt been exceeded by anyone
  based and redpilled
  smart people should breed with smart people we dont know enough about genes yet to do so we only gonna fuck it up not long ago they found a completly new genome and dna strings in the embryo which set back genetic engineering back to the stoneage so not in the first decade and probably decades i agree with the one who said agi comes first so dont mess with something we dont know shit about think of the human as rather perfect as they are normal is kinda good they can understand almost just the same as someone brilliant its just harder to swollow and takes shit loads of time thats the difference we humans move to fast anyway lately its gonna cause problems at last and we may need super humans to save us but yeah isnt it great übermench
  the thing is high iq often means an imbalance between areas in your brain where one area functions at a really advanced level while you struggle in others this leads to instability neuroticism etc its not caued by high iq on its own
  high iq often means an imbalance between areas in your brain  hahahahahahahaha
      good read
actually buying any of this fake chink science  crispr is fake news
  dnamanipulating animals is way harder than dnamanipulating plants and doing it with plants is already really hard there is a reason why we dont have modified cows that are resitant to all diseases and produce super delicious steaks and lots of milk
have you read this thoughts
  ive read some of it its good for you id recommend it but dont let it get to your head
  its fucking amazing
  its been debunked to hell and back there were no revolutions but bad record keeping making it seem like stuff came out of nowhere
  i like the copernican revolution better
okay guys how would i heat something being a gas to 1500 c for only 001 second i am thinking electrolysis another other ideas
what will be the most important branches of math in the future    since biology is looking to be to the 21st century what theoretical physics was to the 20th will mathematical bio be the hottest field of math  theres also scientific computing and mathematical physics which look promising   what do you think
  i dont know but ive chosen studying pure math instead of mathematical biology i hope that i will be able to get close to biology later
  ive chosen studying pure math instead of mathematical biology  why if as you stated youre interested in bio
  lmao out of all my fellow undergrads ive only met one physics dude who studies biophysics now youre trying to find a math biology researcher good luck m8 biologists cant even expand natural logs
  literally doesnt know what quantitative biology is  you have no idea what the fuck youre talking about
cue that one paper where some medical researcher discovers the riemann integral
  ai
  ai will do biology for us
  you mean tais method because if so it was only the trapezoidal method which is miles more simple than riemann integrals
  because when i saw some of the biologists on this board they were very unhappy with the job market  also because biology isnt as exact as math  biology isnt 100 sure on so many topics and also i would need chemistry and chemistry is hard for me because i dont understand all the underlying principles and if i had to study biochemistry or something like that  i dont know  math is hard to learn but math is mostly idealistic real world isnt
  they were very unhappy with the job market  arent biotech and biochem supposed to be booming
bump
  t h i s biologists on suicide watch hahahahahaha
  what the difference between math biology and bioinformatics bioinformatics has been here for a while now and it basically uses math to calculate stuff like whats on your pic related
  ai cant perform lab work wed need actual androids with hands of humantier precission to do anything with cell cultures or experimental animal handling so if theres anyone losing their jobs anytime soon it isnt biologists
  bioinformatics and mathematical biology are related but separate branches of a broader field called quantitative biology
  bioinformatics is very much a statistical discipline the questions you may ask are statistical in nature eg the statistical probabilistic properties of certain motifs subsequences in different strands of dna another question might be about the relationship of certain genes with each other ie correlation and a certain observed disease or phenotype    mathematical biology on the other hand is inspired by certain problems in applied mathematics problems like modelling osmosis and diffusion using certain pdes modelling cancer growth populations of bacteria using either pdes or stochastic processes or spdes    so they both look at different problems in biology with different areas of mathematics a good intersection of the two is probably in modelling evolutionary processes
  is math bio worth getting into or is it boring/a dead end
i mean is there any interesting leads we have what problems are to be solved by applying higher level math to biology
  protein folding ie the most important problem in biology currently
  what mathematics is applicable
  dumbest comment
  yes lab monkeys are in high demand as much as code monkeys in fact
  ur mom expanded my natural log
probably some abstract bs that a small subset of the human population cares about
  tfw already ahead of the curve majoring in math and minoring in biology
  it is worth it and is very much booming
  mathematics and computer science allows for the modeling of natural systems this includes disease spread cancer proliferation protein folding etc    dynamical systems probability theory linear algebra of course statistics
this is all grothendiecks fault  grothendieck go fuck yourself i dont wanna learn biology
  scientific computing and mathematical physics  should you study math physics or cs to do those stuff like quantum computing theoretical hep and whatnot
  will mathematical bio be the hottest field of math  nope itll be accepted tentatively as they do random numerical calculations then discarded when the results dry up   theres also scientific computing and mathematical physics which look promising   mathematical physics has looked promising since newton scientific computing has looked promising since the 1940s after all its just computer science and resource optimization where were you at all these years    heres the order of the greatness of fields and how they will always be ordered    linear algebra  mathematical physics/fluid dynamics  algebraic geometry differential geometry and functional analysis  complex and real analysis  topology  group theory  ring theory  field theory  industrial mathematics  combinatorics  mathematical biology  graph theory  number theory  statistics  data science  mathematical logic
  my opinions are fact
  anything relating to probability theory/statistics numerical optimization etc will be good     mathematical biology is basically mathematicians fucking around with population genetics etc while bioinformatics is data science the biology edition
  probability theory/statistics numerical optimization  thats boring as shit
does qualia exist  define qualia  the internal and subjective component of sense perceptions arising from stimulation of the senses by phenomena
  prove that it arises from the stimulation of the senses and would not exist without them
  is that diagram telling me to check them
  does any phenomenon exist
  define the  define internal  define and  define subjective  define component  define of  define sense  define perceptions  define arising  define from  define stimulation  define senses  define by  define phenomena
  prove that it arises from the stimulation of the senses and would not exist without them    phenomena is arbitrary and affects us arbitrarily therefore it affects our senses in ways we cannot control op defines qualia as the internal and subjective component of sense perceptions one perceiving an arbitrary phenomenon will arbitrarily react hence subjective qualia cannot arise without senses because it is through senses that qualia is defined    does that work
  define define
  its a good attempt however the initial premise is not axiomatic  phenomena is arbitrary and affects us arbitrarily  i do not find this to be self evident in fact the opposite appears true from my experience
  i do not find this to be self evident in fact the opposite appears true from my experience  youre saying that all phenomena is absolutely commonplace and we can predict all future phenomena with 100 accuracy

why hasnt anyone gone back to the moon since 1972 /sci/    not just nasa but dont the space agencies of several other countries today have tech way ahead of where nasa was 50 years ago    there are various explanations and rationales out there but they always seem to be different and questionable ones  the wikipedia article on moon landing conspiracy theories doesnt include or address the why havent we gone back issue at all     to be clear i dont think the moon landings were faked but i can see why so many think they were
theres nothing to do there
  theres no pussy on the moon    thats why
  theres nothing easy to do there  you could mine titanium and make rocket fuel out of all the water ice you crush out of the rocks but that isnt easy
  that isnt easy    debatable
because ayy lmaos lol
  because the cold war ended
  because all the funding was sucked dry by contractors building trash heaps ie the space shuttle
  today have tech way ahead of where nasa was 50 years ago    the human body is just as fragile and unsuited to being in space as it was 50 years ago people will go back to the moon just because its there but there is no compelling reason to rush to do so
this    and this    and tax payers wanted the money going to the poor    there really isnt much else
  yet nato has expanded to the russian border weve stationed nuclear missile defense systems in romania tried to puppet ukraine and just moved 3000 troops and a massive amount of equipment to the russian border    the purpose of nato was clearly stated at its inception to keep the americans in the germans down and the russians out it seems russia and china are in the way of the global agenda and now nato and its masters need them out of existence or brought to their knees    the cold war never ended it just changed its form china is rising fast russia is steady state but well behind in many areas the cabal likely wants a third world war to take care of whats left of the us russia and china
  we have gone back many times just not with people we havent taken people because its like 20 times more difficult and theres no real point    
  why hasnt anyone gone back to the moon since 1972 /sci/  because it was expensive and the political support for space exploration basically evaporated at the end of the cold war
  i read somewhere we could fund 8 moon missions if we stopped food stamps for a year
you can cure the incurable peyronies disease with an electric tooth brush    what will reactiveate dormant hair follicles
  i saw one of those tv shows that tries to call bullcrap on those as seen on tv products the laser comb that they were originally gonna talk shit about worked better than professional medical care i did not want to spend big money on a real one staying away from cheap imitation i started using the scanning gun at work that we use for paper work and it was seeming to work but i no longer work around one im not as bald as i thought i would be by this time just a little thin
  not wanting to take fin i experimented with the gpr44 inhibitor setipiprant for a while i participated in a forum that commissioned some chink drug chemists to synthesize a batch and made a 5 solution of the drug in a 532 ratio of etoh to polysoprbate 80 to dimethyl isosorbide and applied a few ml to my temples and other balding scalp areas 12x/day surprisingly i responded really well to it and i actually got maintenance and regrowth of tiny vellus hairs in the temple region it also seemed to improve my hair quality but that mightve just been the effect of putting oily polysorbate 80/dmi on my scalp every day all in all it worked surprisingly well but i stopped taking it because i got probably unrelated health problems and i couldnt rule out the effect of the fairly unresearched drug plus it was expensive what i learned from that was that receptor inhibition is a sketch strategy of holding back the effects of dht because it sorta acts as a levee once you take out the inhibitor you get a flood so i lost a fuckload of hair in just 12 months as soon as i stopped taking it
  i guess that this isnt reactivating dormant hair follicules but rather just a strategy of preventing more hair follicules from becoming dormant from the effects of the action of dht  pgd2     ive read that things like scalp microneedling and various salts can reactivate dormant hair follicules lithium chloride is often used     there was also that big paper that came out last year about lactic acid   scihubtw slash 101038/ncb3575  sadly i dont think just rubbing lactic acid into the scalp will do it i think people have tried it it seems like it should work in theory though you just need to locally increase the cell concentration of lactic acid and the cells should have lactic acid transporters which would let in exogenous lactic acid but i think it just doesnt work theres probably a way to make it work though but it hasnt been discovered by the selfexperimenters yet
        ladies and gentlemen    snake oil coping the thread    xd    look at all those balding fucks    nothing will save you fuckers
  its scientific research into affecting the expression of a genetic disorder using biological methods how is that snake oil
  shatavari asparagus racemosus appied topically  foti / he shou wu polyginum multiflorum applied topically and taken internally  green tea applied topically  ashwagandha withania somnifera applied topically and taken internally    behavioral  no showering in chlorinated brominated fluoridated birth control pill and post metabolic prescription drug laced water  no use of harsh shampoos and conditioners  good diet high in nutrients and low in heavy metals preservatives pestcides / herbicides    my hair started thinning at 19 or so though not terribly i started doing the above and its worked well ive never lived in a city so if municipal water is all you have i dont know what to tell you charcoal and reverse osmosis filtration doesnt remove everything
  i always see this kinda bullshit i aint that bald and wont give a fuck if i am you are a worthless piece of shit and if i worked wherever you work i would be better than you in two weeks if we were in competition i would defeat you i would think the internet would be better than this by now how is this shit still supposed to be funny grow up kid your gonna get old and get cancer like everyone else do it with dignity
  lol whoops used the wrong figure
yes yes fucking idiots    surely the new company 43278 will finally deliver the working miracle product and their unbiased trials confirm this unlike the 43277 snake oil companies before them      shatavari asparagus racemosus appied topically  foti / he shou wu polyginum multiflorum applied topically and taken internally  green tea applied topically  ashwagandha withania somnifera applied topically and taken internally    oh hey we even have a fucking hippie shaman with us here    jesus this used to be a science board all you fucking useless braindead shits need to get shot
  jesus science
  read a book nigger
the cure is to buzz/shave your head and grow a beard if you can if you cant or you have bad skull shape sorry you arent gonna look good
  did you start using all 4 at once or did you work up to acquiring and using these plants  some mixtures definitely work better than using the components separately you want to be able to isolate which component has the most effect
  look at elons old pictures he is living proof it is possible
  the incurable peyronies disease  what there are a variety of ways to fix this collagenase clostridium histolyticum injection surgery and penile traction therapy how does an electric toothbrush help
vacectomy can halt or drastically slow down my only source is my observations and conversations why i never hear about this in media
funny you mention an electric tooth brush since it looks like one of the most effective potential treatments for reversing as opposed to just preventing which appears to be the only thing classic drugs are capable of currently male pattern baldness is also the most primitive wounding    off the back of chinese and indian studies people are experimenting with using types of needle pens or rollers pic related to reverse hair loss with varying degrees of success some are very impressive indeed     iirc there is also one large pharmaceutical that has a treatment in pipeline that is basically a glorified version of this same method which will also almost certainly include proprietary technology to absolutely no ones surprise except from what i remember they are going for abrasion as opposed to penetration     the underlying mechanisms seem to be the same however         thats called a transplant not the same thing
  please give me a source
  with the exception of green tea i started using them all at once and theyre the base i add other things arbitrarily like an initial pass of activated charcoal or baking soda    there are a number of plants out there that protect hair follicles and some the spur infantile or latent follicles to regrow like polygonum multiflorum in china its long been used for this purpose as well as a hair dye theres also folklore around the plant of men consuming it living to be 200 having many wives and children and displaying sexual prowess and so on modern day however its constituents and pharmacology are becoming clearer though i wouldnt write off traditional chinese medicines way of viewing body state and systems
  interesting     theres definitely a simply cure somewhere
  im trying to use a dermaroller with conjunction with rosemary oilas a vasodilator pumpkin seed oilanti dht garlic oilanit inflammatory and castor oil
  honestly while i hate losing hair im a naturally curious person by nature so i want to see what can at the very least have an affect on it  outside of our current medicine
just shave it bro women love that shit
  lol i used a rubberband for my peyronies
  theres another combination of easily attainable chemicals that have been found to jump start the stem cell regeneration process that generates the hair     the team identified two drugs that when applied to the skin of mice influenced hair follicle stem cells in distinct ways to promote lactate production the first drug called rcgd423 activates a cellular signaling pathway called jakstat which transmits information from outside the cell to the nucleus of the cell the research showed that jakstat activation leads to the increased production of lactate and this in turn drives hair follicle stem cell activation and quicker hair growth the other drug called uk5099 blocks pyruvate from entering the mitochondria which forces the production of lactate in the hair follicle stem cells and accelerates hair growth in mice    im planning on experimenting with it when i get the time to right now my hair is ok but its only gonna be that way for a few more years
  what is a troll
  ugh ally sheedy was such a qt back in the day
  darmaroller is a scam doesnt do anything except make you bleed dont fall for this bs guys
  right now my hair is ok but its only gonna be that way for a few more years  thats the worst when you start seeing changes and can read the writing on the wall my hairline is fine typical male hairline and has been this way as far as i can remember however im getting thinning on top especially in the front still looks good the first day after a shower but goes downhill quickly from there second day is fine third day is pretty bad especially in good lighting conditions you can see this motherfucking shiny skull under the thin hair 2/3 of the way from the front to the back hope i keep it as is for 10 years or so im seriously considering a transplant if it goes to shit too quickly
  actually red light therapy what i assume he meant by the laser comb seems to have positive effects on basically all forms of tissue including hair its not going to take you from monk to monkey but it might improve quality a bit
  there isnt if there was everybody would be flaunting their marvelous manes but thats not the case pharmaceutical companies are chomping at the bit to come up with something that actually works they know people are eager to give all their money for a glimmer of hope just look at how much money they make with rogaine and propecia which we all know do jackshit
  theres things being developed as two people already mentioned they just take 57 years to reach the market because of fda bullshit
  there have been things being developed since the 80s the cure for baldness is always 5 years away
  its just hormones deactivating the hair follicles and causing them to to shrink they can be reactivated but it will fuck up your hormones and thus your body you can offset it by implanting hair follicles from elsewhere that have different affinity to testosterone like your arms or balls
  they can be reactivated but it will fuck up your hormones and thus your body  refer to my post above polygonum multiflorum reactivates them to no ill effect topically and internally
  if they can be deactivated we can easily make them reactive
bump for cure
there already is a baldness cure its called a hair transplant
  troy bearsuit guy hurtubise allegedly cure baldness with his rlight which uses lasers and some kind of filter to help growth also helps plants grow in anything        unfortunately he died a few months ago
  interesting do you happen to have papers about this
  women
  a wig
  /sci/ is a christian board fedora friends are not welcome
  i thought that was bob crane col hogan
  so the first is what we got while the second is a fantasy thatll never happen and still isnt a cure and only the likes of elon musk will be able to afford
  youre bald lmao
  look it up on pubmed fairly well known
  holy shit cannot unsee
  broccoli sprouts nonironically  
  what was the name
  science board  read a book nigger    my sides
  dht  pgd2  ok im becoming bald and im interested in this shit problem is i know jackshit about biology can you dumb it down for me or is there a place where i can read more about this but at an eli22 level
  stem cells its 100 proven to work
  where can i get this stem cell treatment how much will it set me back
  like blood stem cells or baby ones
  nanomachines son is your future baldness cure    tiny machines probably only on the micro scale actually could insert and attach new hair follicles to your scalp
is there an evolutionary reason for this for why wide people is apparantly less trustworthy
  unknown evolpsych is a very popular psuedoscience there is ironically no current scientific explanation to the image you posted
more testosterone during development more likely to have multiple partners / more aggressive untrustworthy
wide faces are probably due to high test those with high test are probably more agressive
  because fatties obviously lack self control and self discipline
  hm i never noticed but i find myself agreeing with the pic seems physiologically obvious like weasels can be tricky but you know a cow is being straightforward im sure the evolutionary advantage is with the face and not with the one who decides to trust it
  david perrett is a hack
  evolpsych is a very popular psuedoscience  t sjw who thinks evolution magically doesnt apply to the human brain because its conclusions hurt your feelings
fat people cant be trusted
prejudices are correct and natures way of protection
  le sjw strawman  obviously evolution effect the brain and not a single person in the word knows how
  source or gtfo
  weird i find the wider faces more trustworhy and the longer ones more ratlike and weaselly    t extremely long face
  so that leads to the question why did wide faces evolve to be a marker of this what purpose could wide faces have
i dunno evolution is weird you know in species of scarab beetles a males sexual organs are inversely correlated with the size of his horn
  you missed the experiments they did where they made a second slightly different earth to test how humans would evolve on it
  people brainwashed by incel and fauxalpha male far right rhetoric dont have valid opinions though
  hmmm sounds like typical wideface manipulation
  what gave you the impression that i was alt right or pua      well it would be stupid of me to post my face on 4chan now wouldnt it i can assure you i have a long face though could post a pic of my grandpas very long face but thats not really proof
  brainlet
  probably due to more robust skull structure just wider meaning stronger in this case physically
  the sample size for this study is 115 people also iirc it was done on business students as well
  youre being the idiot right now evolution has clearly shaped the human brain and anybody who denies this or goes with tabula rasa shit is a retard but assuming each and every random statistical finding with a small sample size is evidence of some evolutionary mechanism is also stupid much of this oneoff garbage is unscientific inferring too much from little data with no actual causal understanding constructing models out of thin air    thats the main issue with a lot of evopsych garbage floating around not that the idea behind evolution shaping psychology is invalid but that most of these studies are just bad fucking science    thats not true either some basic things like how evolution can shape the architecture of a neural system or how behaviours could become hard wired is understood the problem is that taking some random ass data about face width and trustworthiness to construct models from is ass backwards
  slim face  feminine wide face  masculine
  so why do women prefer men with wider more high testosterone face evolutionarily shouldnt they avoid them if they are more likely to be aggressive and dangerous
  this has been debunked years ago  testosterone does make aggressive it makes you more social
  well it would be stupid of me to post my face on 4chan now wouldnt it  what a faggot
  just because you dont understand the reason doesnt mean there isnt a reason     stockier build could be caused by a shortage of ressources that correlate with a tendency to predate upon samespecies individuals via inlearned beheaviors  thus leading to a genetic disposition to trust people of a stockier build less     in other words youre a fucking moron
  why people on 4chan are so obsessed with literally milimiters of bone is something i will never understand
  women dont always their tastes change monthly along with their cycle they like wide jaws one day and then 3 weeks later they dont etc
  widefaced people look like they could fuck you up more easily and most of the time they can because theyre bigger and stronger idk about this trustworthiness bullshit
do i have a round face
  faces different brightness different facial expressions squinted vs wider eyes slightly different eyebrows then again id probably have a mean face too if i was obese
  thank god for guns
  ok im sorry for saying this im kind of chickenshit i cant lie i should not own a gun under any circumstances thank god i never will if i didnt have people protecting me id be screwed the police i mean
  thats so bad   poorly attempted jargon meant for expressing thoughtless gibberish   you shouldnt be proud  what you wrote was weird
  because its a nigger trait  every person who ever screwed me over had a wide face  every person who ever chimped out on me had a wide face  too thin of a face is bad too usually low iq or autistic there is a golden mean like all else for humans   ill tell you one last thing too wide face white niggers are some real bad liars they always get upset when they lie
  fat we steal your food and you dont trust us
  youre conceptualizing the very bedrock of thinking analytically to people who if they even had the attention span required would not begin to possess the wherewithal to agree with you critically
  because its protective wider face means more bone mass which makes it harder to torque your head with a punch and also makes it harder to break
  jews have thin long faces
  in what world they have wide faces long noses and mandibular prognathism
if the face is wide hes got something to hide
    aggression is a double edged sword as is any strength    so thats why my gf left me /s    might be exaggerating the truth a bit there m8
  if the face is narrow hell get used like a wheelbarrow    also hes a bit of a mouthbreather
  this also greedy fucks tend to eat up without conviction
lets apply that theory to obama and trump who is more trustworthier
  evolutionary psychology is very often used by sjw themselves
  widefaced white man  narrowfaced nigger  it balances out
  more testosterone
  done on business sociopaths  good point this isnt fair to wide faced people at all    ridiculous that you think explaining basic problems with the methodology and rigor of evo psyche are the bedrock of analytical thought      i think semites tend to have mediuk facial width globular skulls with foreshortened occipitals big brow ridge flat cheekbones and weak mandibles overbite and teeth crowding big high ears weak orbitals
  if they werent politicians id probably trust obama more he looks like he has concern for shit trump just looks blatantly american
  what the fuck am i reading its the narrow faced people who are lest trustworthy
because people with wide faces look like idiots the two on the left look like their names are barry and gazzer and that their iq is below 100 and that their favourite pastime is getting in a sneaky kick to the head after their friend has knocked out a passerby
  so do we also need to look at a different universe to study physics
  fake study to feminize you even more
  do you understand the difference between evolutionary psychology and just psychology
  t sjw who thinks evolution magically doesnt apply to the human brain because its conclusions hurt your feelings  the goal of evolutionary psychology is to treat the current status quo as a biological imperative
  i think you meant more hgh
  id say i have a wide face and im pretty trustworthy though i may just be an outlier p
    gracile/robust tender/hunter        so were different colours  and were different creeds  and different people have different needs  its obvious you hate me  though ive done nothing wrong  i never even met you  so what could i have done    /whiny bitch
  wide faces long noses and mandibular prognathism    good luck trying to hide a few bucks under the mattress lol
  /pol/ is just over the corner thats why
is his jaw slim or wide /sci/
  because those pudgy faggots look so manly
  take it easy there my wide faced friend    theres still jobs for you in the mines the state police or any other job that doesnt require empathy or a fully developed brain
  slim faces are more likely to be germanics and wide faces are more likely to be celts and slavs
  implying the current status quo isnt caused in part by biological imperatives
why were there so few jewish mathematicians publishing before the 1900s after which it seems nearly every other german mathematician was
  most of those jewish mathematicians were from one high school in hungary    
  jews were excluded from working in most industries in europe for most of history including academia
instead of crying about the coming armageddon like you fags ive decided on establishing a insectfriendly environment in my backyard what are some options ive money and time and am currently disturbed by the lack of critters in my backyard and want to bring the fuckers back with plenty of food and water    i live in a place with seasonal rains and 4 months of no rain at all what are my options /sci/entists
fags  why the homophobia
  get rid of wifi and cell phones as well as smart meters  stop mowing your lawn  plant some flowers and or trees  tell your weaponized neighbors to stop spraying their walks and so on with roundup and to also clean up their electromagnetic environment    thats about it
  go to your states parks and wildlife website and find native plants and grasses for your region i think the state of texas has a native grass replanting program and you can get them to send you seeds
  restore your lawn to natural grasslands vist the existing remnants of native habitat and learn the plants and insects conduct surveys noting plantinsect relations learn the biology and ecology of native plants and insects save seeds plant the good seeds wherever you can grow them in the places that seem suitable try to focus on building wildlife corridors of native vegetation so insects can disperse and get your community involved contact local experts   what you are wanting to do is unbelievably hard simply restoring native plant communities is a very good start dont forget about water and decaying organic matter either
  this wifi and electromagnetic stuff is real tho that report said insect populations dropped in protected areas which i suppose did not contain wifi or comm towers nearby pardon my ignorance i just want my insects back
  thanks for the tip bro but i dont think it is unbelievably hard local wildlife seeds are cheap and agriculture guides are very common taking care of a local ecosystem in a neighbourhood isnt so impossible this mindset is probablt what causes so many people to give in to meme nihilism because everything always seem so much harder than it seems
  why the fuck would you want insects in your home thats the 1 thing im looking forward to getting rid of if we ever learn to terraform a planet like mars or a satellite like the moon
  tell your weaponized neighbors to stop spraying their walks and so on with roundup  the sad thing is the only time ive seen someone listen about that kind of thing was when it was really obvious their dog died because of lawn chemicals its literally saving money good for the planet and the whole downside is you have a slightly less perfect lawn to never use

how many chiral centers does this molecule have i am struggling to work it out
i dont see any carbon atom with 4 different substituents
  doesnt have to be a carbon any atom with 4 constituents can be a chiral center
  nigga just count them
2
  well where do you see one  i dont see any 
  the 3 n atoms outside the ring are chiral centers
  pubchem agrees with me zero stereocenters for the glipizide molecule
  nah m8 amines undergo nitrogen inversion r3n wont be chiral unless the nitrogen is part of a 3 membered ring and therefore unable to undergo inversion
  thank you
  one the nitrogen connected to the sulfur
  lol that atom is planar retard
  no its sp3 nitrogen has the lone pair its not chiral though since the lone pair can invert
itt high iq /sci/ doesnt recognize a bait thread from just a few weeks ago
  this is what brainlets belive     is right
  they are amides so they cant invert and are achiral also ability of a chiral centre to invert doesnt remove its chirality
  making bait threads is even more retarded than not getting them
  3 because of the nitrogrens the lone pair switches so rapidly at normal temperatures though its essentially racemic but at lower temperatures its possible to have two separate molecules of a chiral nitrogen in this case youd have several stereoisomers
  this just apply the rule and you gucci im taking the bait idc       mmh sounds weird to me since only an atom with 4 electrons can have 4 different substituents doesnt nitrogen have 5
why does /sci/ believe they know more about climate change than the foremost atmospheric physicist in the world richard lindzen   it seems the supporters of climate change are just popfigures like bill nye and neil tyson whereas actual leading scientists in the field are not so hysterical

  hes a faggot lying scumbag
    where are all these mindblow posts coming from

  what the fuck was this  i literally cant stop laughing  like what the fuck inspired this outstanding spergburst
does anyone feel like theyre absolute retards for not going to a top school i just looked at the problems for mits electromagnetism course and i couldnt do most of them despite having no issues with my big state universities physics major em course is everyone at lower tier institutions taking babby level courses should i have been learning material outside of all my classes this whole time    ii thought that the meme schools being better was mostly just a brand
here are the exams for the class i was looking at btw   
  this is all covered by chapters 810 in griffiths you can work through them we did this stuff at my state uni but didnt spend much time on it instead we did more stuff about gage theory     presumably if you attend lectures and do the work it would be easy
there is really no such thing as a top school college rankings are just popularity contests and they dont actually assess the academic quality of institutions    
  poorfag
  adam ruins everything  jump off a bridge
      not an argument
  interesting my course actually uses griffiths and im only just finishing the first semester in a 2 semester course maybe ill be able to do this by the end of next semester
  why did you misspell baby
    a soiboy video isnt an argument either
    ok how about this          
yes top schools are worth any amount of money even rich people regret that they couldnt go when they were young
  my big state uni gives harder homework than cornell from what i have gathered from googling problem sets with solutions for studying i specify cornell because they come up the most consistently    even if they are somewhat better its not like i go to lecture anyway i just read the textbooks they tell me to i would be paying 3x as much for their name    csbab btw
  same italian guy apparently
  hello newfag  welcome to 4channel  i too found out about this website from facebook in 2014
  no one asked     im not dense enough to not know its a meme im wondering whats so funny about it
according to her blog posts the drug and rape allegation comes from an assumption of what happened to her during a night that she cannot remember     it is as though a false memory had been implanted which because it never actually happened had to be remembered as an evening she doesnt remember     nor does she remember waking up the next morning and going to the office i kept a record of everything she posted in case her stories morphed over time so this is sad which for me defies explanation    think he did it  yes or no /sci/

  fellow man of culture here his books are also pretty good
  
  27 is pretty good i have all his books as pdf and epub files and can share them if you want
  my god i wish i could buy one he has one called why is the milk gone and i bet its an awesome book idk if he ships them to my country so instead i binge watch his entire channel almost everyday and this is not an exageration whats your favorite video made by him
  replied before you deleted the post see  27   want me to share the books so you can read them on your phone instead
  sorry my reply had too many typos so i deleted it your fav is the 27 video i didnt click the link because i cant right now but that was a good video rly liked it  that would be awesome he has many books what book of him do you have
  uploaded them to mega i reccomend starting with the 5th science   
  wow thanks a lot man didnt know he had those books only knew about logic beach i hope his books are as fantastic as his videos his recent video seems like he got the idea out of a book
  oh hello you are alive is by far the best i listen to it every morning when i drive to college do you have his book called why is the milk gone in pdf also because his video about it was awesome also thanks for sharing it
  havent heard of that one the link in why is the milk gone video is to the book prince of milk which you can download
  oh wait i think the prince of milk is that book im talking about
  yeah i already noticed it ahah dude what you dont know about the existence of that video its 4 years old but its the most famous video lf him go watch it as soon as possible that video is so good best video ever

is there any good mathematics behind stock market analysis     most of these wall street people who claim to be professional analysts dont actually have the maths education to interpret the mathematics seen in statistical mechanics stochastic processes and dynamical systems which undoubtedly should be able to explain market movement better than drawing lines on a candlestick chart     but i do damnit and i want to use my meme education to make money i just cant help but think there must be some deeper mathematics which can analyze these processes in a far more coherent manner than the wishfulthinking handwavey arguments seen in most socalled technical analysis i just havent been able to find proper resources to learn myself because most of the material on technical analysis is written by people who dont understand mathematics for people who dont understand mathematics
  most of these wall street people who claim to be professional analysts dont actually have the maths education to interpret the mathematics seen in statistical mechanics stochastic processes and dynamical systems  they do stochastic processes is easy stuff you can teach it to children
  i just cant help but think there must be some deeper mathematics which can analyze these processes in a far more coherent manner  i dont know why you would think this  the stock market is not a natural phenomenon even in its modern computerdriven state its still fundamentally determined by human behaviour and humans very rarely make mathematical sense
  hmmm
  human behavior in terms of retail investors making market decisions can still be categorized and produce trends the majority of market volume is not retail investors and by mandated liquidity of markets via market makers as well as ever increasing algorithm driven highfrequency traders the end result is that decisions are not as human as they might seem from the outside looking in but regardless a random process in which each state is equally probably should provide some means of metaanalysis

  what job did you get with a bs in math

is mathf_p/math being well defined sufficient enough information to claim mathfin lp/math 
  categories
  kudos to him but it seems to me that he is just parroting definitions some of which he doesnt understand
  im puzzled by the comments on the videos who the fuck decides to learn category theory from some prepubescent kid on youtube
  try reading the definition
  it is since for the pnorm to be defined mathfp/math has to be integrable
whats the intuition behind the norm of mathlinftyab/math as defined mathf_infty  textesssupf /math 
  for simple functions its literally just the limit as p approaches infinity then you generalize
  do you mean simple functions in the strict sense or are you talking loosely 
  i mean simple functions in the sense of finite linear combination of indicator functions
  true or false a local artinian ring has finitely many prime ideals    i think this is true but my proof never uses the local assumption tell me if this makes sense    let mathp_lambda_lambda in lambda/math be the prime ideals in mathr/math and suppose we have a wellordering for mathlambda/math then we have a descending chain mathsum_lambda p_lambda  i_0 supset i_1 supset  /math of ideals formed by removing the ideals mathp_lambda/math from the sum one by one by the artinian assumption this must terminate in finitely many steps so if mathp_0p_n/math were the first to be removed then the remaining sum must be 0 because the chain mathi_0 supset i_1 supset  /math will eventually reach 0 after removing all the mathp_lambda/math so mathp_0p_n/math were the only nonzero prime ideals after all
  essentially its just the largest value of the function while ignoring any single points that might be larger by single i points from a set of measure zero
  you dont need localness all artinian rings have this property  although its not clear to me that theres any part of your argument that refers to the fact that the ideals are prime and you do need this assumption    i think its cleaner to do the contrapositive of this personally but with your additional assumption the statement is completely trivial if you know enough theory to claim that prime ideals are maximal in an artinian ring
  prime ideals are maximal in an artinian ring  what theory do i need for this is there a quick proof
  is there a quick proof  its not very long you can prove in a paragraph that artinian integral domains are fields    then modding out by a prime gives you an artinian id so you get a field which means the prime ideal was maximal
  neat thanks anon

  first semester real analysis  first eight weeks covered the usual shit in a logical order naturals integers reals topology of the reals and convergence  second eight weeks has been helterskelter shit continuity derivatives power series fundamental theorem of calculus after skipping riemann integrals entirely and now change of variables in multiple integrals  no shit the prof had us taking jacobian determinants and computing double integrals in lecture todaynot sure if were even going to cover riemann integrals at this point  i seriously hope this shit hole doesnt lose its accreditation but i would not be surprised if it did the curriculum is a shit show and the prof whose credentials are a ma in education is teaching the same course graduate students the only proper phd in math in the department is stuck teaching college algebra and calculus its hot bullshit
  analysis  skipping riemann integration  you sure you signed up for the right course
  just learn it yourself its relatively simple did you at least go over darboux integration and establish an equivalence
  tfw just now realizing that we were taught darboux integration instead of riemann integration in my analysis i class  i mean the equivalence doesnt seem too complicated from the wikipedia skimming i just did but still
  doesnt seem too complicated  literally half a line showing that a riemann sum is smaller than an upper sum and larger than a lower sum
  yes unfortunately    the only integration weve covered so far was in the fundamental theorem of calculus and our most recent lecture on multiple integrals i plan to learn it myself before the final and revisit it in my gap year before grad school
  ive never seen the actual riemann sum definition before jeez anon i agree its intuitively obvious but i dont do much analysis and am cautious about these things
if mathr/math is a finite ring some powers of each element is an idempotent  why
  uni friends  mathematically speaking is it even possible to make friends in uni
  tautologically true
  how
  trivially
  i dont follow
  say the ring has n elements now take any element of your ring lets call the element a and make a list of that element to each power from 1 to n1 with n1 included ie a a2an1))) each of those is an element of your ring but by the pigeonhole principle two of those elements are the same lets say ak and akh with 1kkhn1 now   mathakh2akhakhakh1akahahk1akh1akhahk1akh1akahk1akhahk1/math  repeat this procedure until youre left with mathakh2akh/math
  why do we still use these weak ass integral definitions when measure theory exists
  measure is harder to define and difficult to motivate until you see the limitations of the ri
  br
  extensive research and assessment of the planned future actions of a company will yield you far better results than numerical analysis practice with small sums of money to build experience and learn how to recognize trends specialize in one industry preferably one on an uptrend and learn its inner workings as well as possible then invest in the company you are most confident in good luck
  measure is harder to define  is it i feel like you could teach enough to define the lebesgue integral in a first year course assuming your students arent mentally challenged  and difficult to motivate  i disagree its pretty intuitive as long as you dont get into the harder stuff
  i have friends at uni but im studying money and people in maths are probably somewhat more autistic  but i could make friends with bricks so the point stands
  no the efficient market hypothesis is correct enough that any meme analysis technique is worthless
  what undergrads think lebesgue integration is  ayoo lemme just use the lebesgue equivalent of the fundamental theorems and measure literally anything  what lebesgue integration actually is  do i have a riemannintegrable function thats equal ae to that no hmmm seems like ill have to use some other tricks to turn this into a riemann integration problem
  even if what you were saying was true it doesnt adress my point
mathl1absubsetneq l2ab/math  would not mathfxfrac1sqrtx/math prove this instantly
  yeah
  is there a stronger counterexample though something which is in mathl1/math on an arbitrary interval but not in mathl2/math
  you still have to prove that the integral can be computed using antiderivative
  agree if you are encountering integration for the first time the case you are most interested in is that of continuous functions in that case riemann/darboux is sufficient to have differentiation theorem fundamental theorem and fubini which is what you need in other contexts basic geometry and such  it is true that measure theory and lebesgue and such integration are interesting but it is much work which you wont even need
  riemannstieltjes is the real redpill
  but it is much work which you wont even need  dominated/monotone convergence theorem      thats still a special case of generic integration with an arbitrary measure
  uhm you want to ensure lebesgue integrability what i am claiming is that for continuous or smooth functions the basic theory is well seen with riemann integrals i am not saying that lebesgue is not useful even in that context it has many applications and i like it very much for someone who is not interested in analysis but i fail to see how one first year undergraduate is expected to study lebesgue integration in particular  why do we still use these weak ass integral definitions when measure theory exists  is a bad comment for 10170584 we use them when it is sufficient thats all
  what im saying is that lebesgue measure is a lot stronger for slightly less work
is it true that if i have an open subset mathasubsetmathbbr2/math and i take a point in it mathx/math and i take mathrdzfra)))/math then the ball of this radius and center mathz/math is the largest ball contained in the set with that center
  maybe it is possible then
does anyone have a proof of mathdisplaystyle lim_pto infty f_p  f_infty/math or at least a sketch my professor mentioned it but skipped out on the details due to time and its not shown in the textbook
  google is your friend
  here is a stupid way of thinking about it consider some simple function lets say is takes value 10 on the interval ab this function is quite nice its bounded and is in every lp space over the real line lets consider the limit youre looking at this integral is easy to compute it is 10ba1/p and as p goes to infinity this is just 10 which is what you want from you linfinity norm this sketch is basically what you do decompose your function into simple functions which they themselves are finite linear combinations of scaled indicator functions as above and run the same process with them because you have a linear combination of simple functions it requires one of two more steps but not much else then you merely note that these simple functions are dense in your lp spaces and since you can run this procedure with them you can run the procedure with linear combinations you have the desired limit thats really it
  trying to mimic another proof which used a squeezing arguement got as far as saying mathdisplaystyle f_p  f_inftyleft int_ableftfracf f_inftyrightprightfrac1p/math but i need to get rid of that messy integral with some inequality i know that mathfleq f_infty implies fracff_inftyleq 1/math just not sure what to write here mathf_p leq f_infty frac1p/math  perhaps mathf_p leq f_infty f_1frac1p/math 
  well no you get the inequality  mathf_p le f_inftyba1/p/math  now of course if you want to use a squeeze argument you have to get a lower bound how do you suggest we do that 
let np be prime suppose a b in bz_p with a neq 0   show that there is a unique q in bz_p such that b  aq   can you make sense of fracba in bz_p   hint show that multiplication by a in bz_p is an injective function   and hence bijective    anyone pls pretty confused
  math /math instead of   eg math n  p /math instead of np
  sorry i mean math  /math without the space between  and / 
let mathp/math be prime suppose matha b in z_p/math with matha neq 0/math   show that there is a unique mathq in z_p/math such that mathb  aq/math      hint show that multiplication by matha/math in mathz_p/math is an injective function   and hence bijective
  let p be prime suppose abzp with matha neq 0/math  show that there is a unique qzp such that baq  hint show that multiplication by a in zp is an injective function  and hence bijective
  i got to the point where i have xpnaypny and therefore xy to show that it is an injective function but my problem is i dont feel my reasoning is sufficient more specifically what if p was a composite integer how would that change the steps i took i represented a with pna x with pnx and y with pny
  sorry i have ypna on the right side and because multiplication is well defined i just multiplied it out
  if x is in 1 1 fxx1/2  otherwise fx0
  some proofs bound it below by mathf_infty/math but i have no fucking clue why
  that is to say mathf_infty leq f_p leq f_infty1_1frac1p/math but i have yet to see a justification for this step
  hint this is actually a property of units hence since zp is a field for every nonzero element  an element a of a commutative ring r is a unit if and only if multiplication by u is bijective  in fact you only have to prove injective or surjective in a finite ring since bijective is automatic from that
im considering majoring in maths while in the army reserves will it be too hard
  why would it be
  i get the impression that a lot of you guys are students that dont work on the side
  i worked 6 hours a day while doing my masters degree i graduated with the best possible grades
  will it be too hard  only if you slack
  but thats wrong  denoting lebesgue measure by mathlamba/math we can construct new measures by matha lambdamu/math where a is any postive  mathf_infty/math is invariant under any math/mu/math while any other mathf_p/math clearly isnt
ever since i heard people can learn math in their sleep ive began thinking more about it in my sleep without lucid dreaming anyone else share this
  ive had some insights during sleep but only after hours of studying nonstop i dont believe you can do that without being heavily exposed to the material  but i have to say that most of the time its just hallucinations one time i dreamt of solving the riemann hypothesis but it was only a hallucination of course its pretty cool
    ive had some eureka moments in my sleep sadly most of them i forget after i wake up in one of them i truly understood projective space which is killing me not to know
hmmmmmm
hmmmmmmmmmmmmm
  i beg your pardon
  lax you shill i know its you  but the book is good so ill forgive you
  there is no contradiction the scaling factor that appears in front of mathf_p/math converges to 1 when p goes to infinity      well i dont know about that it looks suspicious on 01 it would imply that all positive functions are ae equal to their sup however we have the next best thing   recall that for each mathvarepsilon  0/math we have mathlambdax in ab fx ge f_infty varepsilon  0/math where mathlambda/math is the lebesgue measure   i am not sure what your definition of mathcdot_infty /math is either this is by definition or if you are working with continuous functions and defining it as the supremum this should be an easy exercise  then for each mathvarepsilon  0/math set matha_varepsilon  x in ab fxge f_infty  varepsilon/math we have  eqnf_pp ge int_a_varepsilon fp dlambda ge int_a_varepsilon f_infty  varepsilonp dlambda  lambdaa_varepsilonf_infty  varepsilonp/eqn  then we have mathlambdaa_varepsilon1/pf_inftyvarepsilon le f_p /math  letting mathp/math go to infinity and recalling that mathlambdaa_varepsilon  0/math we get mathf_infty  varepsilon le liminflimits_p to infty f_p/math  this being the case for each mathvarepsilon  0/math we get mathf_infty le liminflimits_p to infty f_p/math  the other inequality mathf_p le f_inftyba1/p/math yields mathlimsup f_p le f_infty/math which completes the proof
abolish zf and c
  not even trying
  rejecting the fact that every surjective function has a right inverse  weak
  proof
  im not in abstract algebra yet this is my introduction to proofs class
  yea i know that math z_p/math is finite i am having trouble proving surjectivity or injectivity
  1 suppose fxax is bijective then it is surjective so fy1 for some y in r but then ay1ya  2 suppose a is a unit and define f r  r by fx  ax if x is in ker f and b is the inverse of a then you have 0  bfx  bax  x so ker f  0 and f is injective
  riemann implying darboux is easy to prove but darboux implying riemann is much more difficult
  implying  darboux implies riemann because to any partition the lower sum is lower or equal to a riemann sum which is lower or equal to the upper sum if the partition can be refined until the upper and lower sums are arbitrarily close the riemann sum is boxed in done  if the lower sum has no supremum then riemann sums can be made arbitrarily small if upper sums have no infimum riemann sums can be made arbitrarily big done
  obviously its much easier to prove something once youve already taken that class and have all the foresights i dont think you can come up with  refined until the upper and lower sums are arbitrarily close the riemann sum is boxed in  if you had just started an analysis class and only have riemann and darboux integrability definitions to work with
  i have not taken abstract algebra yet i am proving it using properties of equivalence classes and injective/ surjective functions
  i literally never had an analysis class and the other proof was made on the spot  we all start stupid tho youll get there someday
i like analysis and pde but i feel bad because i think its a brainlet field help
  dont let others judge you analysis is fun and full of cool people pursue your passion anon
  how is analysis a brainlet field  inb4 real analysis  maybe but functional analysis fourier analysis and analysis on manifolds are fairly hard
  analysis on manifolds  you mean differential geometry
  yeah but then it doesnt have analysis on the name
i think i wouldnt find analysis such a brainlet field if there wasnt so much personality cult around it
  abolishing ac isnt the same as postulating its negation its just assuming a much weaker form of it like countable or dependent choice thats perfectly valid because if you cannot write a set explicitly you shouldnt be able to choose elements without defining properly such function
  you didnt come up with using refinement dipshit you already knew what a refinement is because its literally the first idea given in any textbook on analysis if you already defined what a refinement is and the necessary lemmas to make that proof then its obviously easy
  the only way to learn analysis is taking an analysis course  imagine actually believing this
  didnt say that at all  i dont care where you get your material if youve been already given enough intuition on the subject then saying something thats on the first chapters easy is literal autism
  i have not taken concrete give a fuck yet i am proving it like that
  the proof is literally trivial if you know what a partition is and can actually read the definition  i said it wasnt but fuck you for saying otherwise and actually knowing stuff you bastard
    then why the fuck are you here dipshit this is my board my thread my fucking conversation i gave you a hint dickwad and what pathetic excuse you give me i didnt ask you what you know or dont know because i dont fucking care next time considering injecting a cock up your ass and surject cum all over your face
how would you go about proving that the only entire function that satisfies mathfzcfcirc fzz1c/math must be a translation mathzk/math
  did you try differentiating both sides
  yes but im trying to avoid using that its pretty easy doing that but maybe theres some wizardly way to do it
  iirc the only linear holomorphic functions on the complex plane were translations and scalar multiplications did you try using that
  nevermind forgot translations werent linear
really like math  also like money  hate finance  what do quantitative analysis is boring as shit but i dont want to be a poorfag after grad school where are the wellpaid but interesting mathematician jobs

  you can use 4channelorg/banned for that
  ok cocksucker weebfuck let me stab you in the mouth when i see you
  my professor requires that i prove this stuff using the material he taught us also is it recommended that i study ahead for future classes that i have not yet taken over break i will try to learn complex analysis because my teacher sux balls is this a good habit
  an angry amerimutt sent me an anonymous threat im so scared now
  i was joking dipshit

  most of these wall street people who claim to be professional analysts dont actually have the maths education to interpret the mathematics seen in statistical mechanics stochastic processes and dynamical systems which undoubtedly should be able to explain market movement better than drawing lines on a candlestick chart    that is to maintain the pyramid scheme up there is needed a huge amuont of succers to be benefitted from so that the illusion of opportunity to gain from the stock market is not lost if only 5 of the pyramid drops out in a year burning their bank accounts so that the higher ups can rob them there is no panic or loss of belief in the system then you can induce an economic crisis every now and then to keep idiots who seem to have figured it out at bay    so no there is no mathematical shit that can give you an advantage read the papers and deduse things to come your self  keep in mind if it looks too good to be true it usually is
        how is analysis a brainlet field   inb4 real analysis   maybe but functional analysis fourier analysis and analysis on manifolds are fairly hard    functional and fourier analysis is hard if ur iq is low say 140 who standard not american standard in wich case it would propably be 160 or 180 idk    seems there is a huge difference in scoring though it should be gaussian graph over world population    i tend to get 20  50 points boost to my score in american tests compared to the ones done on my own language regardles the language barrier and incoprehencible instructions in some parts in the americanesian tests         also warpfield analysis is pretty dificult
  idiot
why do i enjoy real math when im severely depressed and contemplating suicide and applied math when im otherwise content to stay alive
  only brainlets are content with living and they are the ones who enjoy applied math true intellectuals appreciate pure math but are usually on the verge of suicide thats just how things work
  nice projection here anon
will spivaks calculus on manifolds help me actually understand something about tensor calculus or does it cover a separate topic
  its a good transition from advanced calculus to real differential geometry if thats what youre looking for go ahead
  if its interesting its usually not wellpaid
whats the name of the function defined as  mathlceil x rfloor  y  x y normaltextsignx/math  where x and y are real numbers
  its called the xy function because if youd remember you dont define powers of real numbers by interpolation but by the exponential function
  wtf youre talking about this isnt xy
    also this comes up all the time in sliding mode control but i hate this notation becausemath lceil x rfloor  y neq lceil x rfloor   y /math     consider it as  def fxy   if x0   return npabsxyx/npabsx   return 0
  iq posting  warpfield analysis  you sound like a turbo brainlet
  fun anal isnt hard its just messy  youre showing too much of your power level its impolite
im currently doing a bs in math at pretty good university ive noticed that when it comes to people doing their masters or phd students they all seem like cool people theres one autist or two but everyone is overall pretty nice    however in my class we have one or two assholes real smug superiority complex type people theyre smart smarter than me and probably among the smartest in the class where do these people go have ive just been lucky in not encountering these kind of people higher up or do they actually disappear
  they get too busy iq posting on /sci/ that they fail all classes and drop out
  i noticed that to those people go to better schools eventually do they meet their match and then they smarten up and stop being assholes
  they get so
youll never be a mathematician in the early 20th or late 19th century when there was a world of possibilities and fields were just starting to be explored in depth  your contributions will instead be limited to proving small results on hyperspecific classes of objects no one cares about  its not fair
  so i guess they just do their masters and phd somewhere else i mean i dont go to the best uni and i dont want to reveal too much since theyre the kind of people that would browse these threads but its a top 100 uni and weve had a couple of fields medalists come out of it most people including these guys are international students meaning they specifically chose to come to this school rather than another i should also point out that the actual smartest guy in class is super nice
  yeah i did undergrad in a top 50 uni and there were a couple of people like that there they all went to top 10 unis for postgrad
  tfw doing undergrad at poorly ranked uni  why do i even bother thinking about postgrad
  it honestly makes me upset knowing that these people will succeed hearing them outright insult my classmates makes my blood boil and ive had to tell them off multiple times it gets even worse since we have some other people on the autism/asperger spectrum who cant handle their rudeness at all meaning they almost break down
  quant finance is actually a pretty interesting subject if youre into analysis/stochastic pde/ machine learning
  try being an applied mathematician or computer scientist at google facebook uber or that type of companies more generally it is doable if you are very and i stress good with algorithms combinatorics computer vision statistics that sort of things also be a good programmer
for the love of god    i have an exam in an hour and aside from otherwise being prepared i forgot how to solve for v using these two equations could someone quickly show me how    math brainlet here
  you fucked up
  yes i did
  what is f
  darcy friction factor its unknown solutions to these types of problems on line just say to solve these two equations to find v
i think bidule is a great word even before i read the parenthetical definition this is pretty much what i assumed it meant    i invented a word like that multiplex i use it to refer to an array of unspecified dimension and transformation properties
  obviously i didnt invent this word but i meant i rely often on a deliberately nonspecific math word
  oh nvm i guess the sensible thing to do would be to isolate v from 1 then just plug in that value in 4 to find the f value then plug that back into 1 for the v value eh    thanks sci
   math epsilon /math  d  f  v  four variables  three equations  nigga i dont know what you expect me to do but i cant
  so is just dividing by the parenthetical stuff on the right side of the second equation then taking the square root not enough
  jon no longer namefagging  officially no longer /the board faggot/ but /the board madman/
  what kind of country is this cause it sounds really unprofessional i mean i met arrogant people but they still keep it low key
  like i said i dont want to reveal too much hes an international student as well so hes not from here he gets told off by teachers assistants and phd students as well whenever theyre around and they see him doing this shit so its not like its accepted behavior
im trying to think of the most economic description of the function that maps sequences of zeroes and ones onto natural numbers suggestions
  describe the map more
  sounds like a one off asshole really weird i am going to assume you are in the uk because this shit would not fly elsewhere it can only be a really complacent culture i am also an international student i studied in nonenglish countries though and if i acted up id immediately be blacklisted by the whole department professors and students alike
  literally the function that takes binary and maps it to natural numbers  on one hand all sequences of zeroes and ones is much cleaner but using all infinite sequences of zeroes and ones such that for each matha_n/math there is n such that nn implies matha_n0/math enables me to use bijection to just say that if a has 1 instead of 0 for some i and b has no ni such that b has 1 and a has 0 then faf0 and this actually completes the whole thing but its disgusting to look at
                since when are math majors such a bunch of namby pambys accept the fact that you wont be able to compete with them because of whatever reason you give and move on stop comparing yourself to other people
  frogposter  retarded opinion  like clockwork
  yeah thats the problem im not much into programming i prefer fields like analysis geometry or topology    most quants seem to describe the work as soulcrushing hence why they often quit early
  you never attacked my argument if you are going to get flustered at someone being a condescending prick to you then perhaps you are more interested in the ego that comes with studying math than studying math itself
  just look up the conversion formula for binary to decimal
  hm i cant say ive heard that a lot of people say its a great balance between intellectual sttimulation and pay however i think those are the good quant jobs some quant jobs are literally algo babysitting and ill agree that that is not fun at all
  but a lot of the research that one of my analysis professors did on variational analysis of pdes has many applications in derivatives pricing probelm is is that ever since 2008 the derivatives industry is not as lively as it used to be because of regulations and whatnot which is a shame because its the closest to pure analysis you might get to in the industry
  unfortunately there seems to be no way to separate the good quantitative researcher job offers from the bad ones and thats assuming good jobs are even available since high level quant positions are usually filled with talent already  you might be right though the people i talked to who quit mathematical finance were somewhat involved the software development aspect even if they werent devs themselves they usually complained about the models being boring shit and having to deal with c    i dont know anything about finance and markets but pdes are neat so ill look into that im trying to find resources on any applications of general topology to finance as well
thought i failed my oral quals  turned out i didnt
  for topology you could do topological data analysis i have a professor at my school who does all kinds of applied topology he even worked with topological robots

  wtf i studied most of this in calculus i  ii in an engineering school  proofs were given but most people slept through them
  such is expected from reimu but not yukari
imagine a world where mathematicians and physicists switch places
what is the most obscure area of mathematics that youre familiar with
algebra feels insanely forbidden
  the homotopic morita theory of differential graded categories
whats the most satisfying maths youve taken
  morita theory is very abstract linear algebra
  euclidean geometry is the absolute best fucking field in the entirety of maths but its basically entirely solved  second place is probably measure theory
  satisfying  basically entirely solved  by definition duh x
  and
  bruhattits theory
  i always get perverse pleasure from long strings of inequalities in analysis but its not exactly satisfying
  i really hate when people write z_n for z/nz z_p is reserved for padic numbers
  getting triggered about ambiguous notations that are literally never unclear from context is a great indicator of autism
  not only that but its solved by very simple polynomial factorization algos via groebner bases literally the most boring piece of math of all time
  imagine this world   what did he mean by this
  is the riemann conjecture true  oh definitely wed have found a counterexample by now if it wasnt
so you want to get a phd in mathematics
evens i study applied modeling and simulations  odds i study mathematical physics
can anyone help me with this
  yeah
  nice
  can anyone help me with this  what have you tried
  d i v i s i o n  w i t h  r e m a i n d e r
anything missing from this
  basically until the sophomore year its stuff every grad student eventually learns but from then on its random stuff learning all the random stuff is just about undoable nowadays
guys apparently there is some book that explains basic linear algebra in an intuitive visual manner its what 3blue1brown based his videos on does anyone remember the name of it i had is saved but lost it
  probably linear algebra done right  but in all seriousness learn linear algebra properly or abstract will fuck you up the ass
  ive already graduated lol never had a problem with linear algebra but i thought i should get around to learning about this new way of visualizing it
  this is absurd and pointless
guide to understanding modular forms from a representation theory perspective
  this is absurd and pointless  what do you mean
  unachievable for a start but also involves learning a ton of stuff which will never be relevant to whatever you specialise in
let u_i be an open cover of a topological space x and let g and f be two continuous functions xy suppose the restriction to each u_i of f and g make the same function i have to show that fg globally    is it fair to conclude this with the argument  f and g must be the same because they are completely determined by their values which must coincide everywhere on x since the u_i are a cover
  yeah god i used to hate questions like that as an undergrad asked to prove something thats right there and obvious
  gluing lemma  is it fair   not sufficient
  i wasnt asked to prove this but i read that for schemes that argument is invalid in general and since im working towards scheme theory perhaps theres an obvious flaw to the argument here      im not gluing anything thats the next step tho
  suppose that for some point x fx/gx theres an u_j that contains x the restriction of f and g to u_j are equal in x thus fg  its either literally just that or im retarded
  im not gluing anything  yes you are youre gluing the 0 function on each patch
  there are no 0s in general topological spaces      its just that
  but there is in abelian sheaves
  proof by contradiction  yikes
  we name a the set on which fxgx thus a contains every u_i since the union of every u_i contains x a contains x
  if you need to be explained why this is ridiculous then you need to get a math degree already and realize that math is more than titles of sections from a book  also not everyone wants to be an arithmetic or complex algebraic geometer or topologist  this board is obsessed with algebraic geometry to an unhealthy degree it is ridiculous and detracts from the fact that there is a whole world of mathematics out there
this is a general test of the level of /mg/ dont post the answer just comment if you dont get it  if a set has an open cover such that no element of the set is in two elements of the cover every set in the open cover is also closed
  obvious that means that each set is a maximal connected component which is equivalent to being closed and open
  using anything other than the literal definition of a topology  failure complete and total failure 0/10
  nigga just spell it out    you are saying that you have a cover of x which is completely disjoint choose any element u of the cover and consider the union v of the rest of the elements v is open as an arbitrary union of open sets and v disjointunion u is x so xv  u is closed   qed retard next time you want your homework done just post it as such you fucking brainlet
  specifically asks people not to answer  if you want people to do your homework just ask it  calls people brainlets
  next time ask something that goes a bit further than applying the definition brainlet even the anime poster that keeps posting tqft parlance who has only ever read definitions would be able to answer that garbage of a question
  that was the point
i wanna test the level of /mg/ dont reply if you got the answer reply if you couldnt get it    show that every connected regular hausdorff space with at least two points is uncountable
i wanna test the level of /mg/ dont reply if you got the answer reply if you couldnt get it    let math n /math be an odd integer math 2 /math and let math fxin mathbbqx /math be an irreducible polynomial of degree math n /math such that the galois group math galf/mathbbq /math is isomorphic to the dihedral group math d_n /math of order math 2n /math let math alpha /math be a real root of math fx /math prove math alpha /math can be expressed by real radicals if and only if every prime divisor of math n /math is a fermat prime
  this may seem like a networks question but its just math i tried to calculate the efficiency of a network with two groups in two ways the first fails the second works uses the regenerative method    eta efficiency  p1 probability of a success from group 1  p2   group 2    first way e is number of failures  eta  1 / e  1  e  0 wp p1 0 wp p2 1  e wp 1  p1  p2      second way e is the number of slots taken to transmit  eta  1 / e  e  1 wp p1 1 wp p2 1  e wp 1  p1  p2    why does the second way create an incorrect result this is for csma/cd if that matters
  cant because my galois theory is absolute trash
  cope
  typical i know that this is classic bait either you study ag and you are trying to detract people from following either you dont and you are coping  it is still a point i wanted to make there is nothing wrong with ag i am getting a phd in the area at the moment but i feel like a lot of people are tricked into getting into it because of bald math guy samurai math guy memey category buzzwords and diagrams and somehow believe that math is a pyramid with probability and pde at the bottom and arithmetic geometry at the top which anyone who knows anything about research math knows is ridiculous first of all because nobody is going to be impressed by the field in which you work and second of all because these areas intersect in many cases
  ask me anything in the tits group
  i agree with what you said i also work in ag and nobody cares if you do ag or any other field but its funny how younglings picture the pyramid
  anyone who actually thinks pde is an easy subject can do us all a solid and solve navierstokes
  math is a pyramid with probability and pde at the bottom and arithmetic geometry at the top  its literally true though pure math is real math applied trash is physics at best
  pde is real math algebra is masturbating over stupid worthless definitions and structures kind of like being a child playing with building blocks  analysis is the only real type of math and pde and harmonic analysis form the two pillars of the domain
  imagine still thinking like this  ag is unique in the sense that it combines a lot of disciplines that were otherwise relatively separated  the more research in mathematics will progress the more we will see these interconnections  remember that a lot of useful mathematical objects were constructed by physfags and refined by mathematicians and that physfags are becoming more and more concerned with abstract mathematical objects and the mathematical reasoning behind
what do you think of this calculus book written in 1910 called calculus made easy
  now any fool can see that  based
  telling people that things are really easy is good pedagogy but you should be careful so that the stupid students dont feel that they are really stupid for struggling with the simple thing  the whole text really makes me think of 1910
  pure math is pure math applied math is applied math there is pure algebraic geometry just as there is pure probability theory and pure pde and there is applied algebraic geometry used eg in statistics computer vision cryptography applied probability theory and applied pde eg numerical approximation schemes etc and obviously all of these interact  you really have to the underest of grads to not realize that

im a complete hack im good at math in the sense that im good at logical thinking and am moderately intelligent but i have no passion for it beyond the passion i have for any intellectual pursuit i certainly havent dedicated myself to it ive memed my way through reu and now im memeing my way through an honors thesis i hate living this lie it wouldnt be so bad if i was passionate about _anything_ but i honestly dont seem to be i managed to trick myself into thinking math was my thing for a few years but i cant pretend anymore
  stop being a faggot

how come he never published
  im about to graduate it would be pointless not to finish      i fell into those largely by luck and coasted through them with the bare minimum i needed to get by i succeeded only because im clever enough to fake competence
  if you seriously think you are smart enough as a 3rd year undergrad to fool a mathematics professor for an entire thesis then you suffer from some kind of pathological narcissism  if you dont then youre being a drama queen for attention    either way stop being a faggot
  how do i know wether or not i am cut out for grad school i am extremely interested in mathematics and i am willing to sacrifice anything to study it i just have this nagging feeling that i am to stupid perhaps it is imposter syndrome and i know i am acting like a little attention seeking faggot i would just like to here the opinion of other grad students who overcame their doubt is it a gradual process or are there indications why do i feel so stupid
  bluepilled
  wtf is going on he seems to be a brilliant guy with extremely insightful answers i never looked up what he published to avoid butthurt so i am really suprised now    perhaps academia is really fucked can you be somehow a freelancer researcher    i wanted to move out from this german shithole to some portugal or whatnot but i cant see how to get moneys without affiliation
  babbys first mental breakdown  youre just hit a snag with you thesis and come crying about it on /sci/  best to just get over it and keep going youll probably be satisfied when you finish it
  remember that a lot of useful mathematical objects were constructed by physfags and refined by mathematicians and that physfags are becoming more and more concerned with abstract mathematical objects and the mathematical reasoning behind  wew back up a bit there its more like mathematicians got inspired by physicists who didnt really construct anything mathematically interesting  theres a long way between writing down improperly defined integrals and talking about cobordisms or cohomology theories
  this is why i am not sure about mathematics at least in physics you know the problem you are working on is important in math not so much that doesnt really sit well with me
why is algebraic geometry so popular these days whereas differential geometry is much less so i am applying to grad programs and pretty much every single school proudly says they do algant algebraic geometry and number theory but very few do differential geometry i think many more do diff geo in the context of mathematical physics is diff geometry basically solved
  its okay it happens to anyone working in a creative and competitive field no matter where you are in your career you will always be surrounded by or competing with people who are doing things you dont understand or people who are impossibly smart or people who have an impossibly wideranging understanding of math and it is hard to deal with it  certainly all the professors i have asked have this nagging feeling and they are the ones who made it through they just learned to tune it out  but of course you do not have to go through this just know that if you pursue math you will feel dumb a lot of the time either because you dont know what to look for or because you tried something that does not work or because you realized something you were working on for a week was a oneliner or because some guy is doing alientier work in your field and you dont know what to make of it
which subjects in math have the least amount of calculations having to solve integrals and ending up with monstrous expressions makes me want to kill myself i like expressing clean theoretical relationships between objects number and variable crunching doesnt interest me
  literally any subject whose name doesnt have analysis or differential geometry  group theory has some autistic enumeration stuff too but its not as bad  if you really like simple stuff id recommend category theory
  yeah i prefer complexity in simplicity as pompous as that sounds never liked analysis especially diffeqs  category theory is really neat ill look into it more deeply
  dg is basically solving pdes on manifolds now so mostly belongs to the analysis department
  having to solve integrals and ending up with monstrous expressions makes me want to kill myself    pretty sure most math is taught in this way to make you think of it as a collection of useless algorithms and rote pattern recognition rather than a useful abstraction of realworld phenominon
  cont    and someone here linked me to a guy who said as much does anyone know who im talking about didnt bookmark his page but i might want to get in touch with him at some point
  what i meant is that using three pages and half an hour to integrate some ugly expression isnt really my idea of fun whereas i enjoyed things such as my set theory course complexity theory or even some topology stuff but as you put it rote pattern recognition ie applying methods to convoluted but ultimately simple problems is not interesting  a useful abstraction  im aware of the usefulness of analysis even then applied math isnt just about analysis right
  complexity theory  what the fuck is complexity theory
  the only interesting part of cs
    analysis is a good topic though ive only ever had to grind through complicated integrals in calc 1 and calc 2 beyond that it gets much nicer but unfortunately thats where most peoples formal education ends if they even get that far
  ive only ever had to grind through complicated integrals in calc 1 and calc 2  diffeqs can often get pretty nasty from what ive seen
    never took diffeqs
  multivariable calculus is nicer than calc 1 and 2    cs has good parts
  yeah computational complexity theory some anon had posted papers that dealt with the application of cct to cosmology it was pretty cool but i lost the link
  perhaps academia is really fucked  took you this long
  diffeqs can get ugly in the computation but the theory alone gets my dick hard
  but the theory alone gets my dick hard  what about it is so satisfying
suppose we have a sum s of nth roots of unity and suppose the norm of s is 1 is s itself a root of unity
  something about eigenvalues and eigenvectors defining linear systems of equations just does it for me  id fuck a damped harmonic oscillator
  yeah i prefer complexity in simplicity as pompous as that sounds    low barrier to entry and you havent been conditioned to avoid the subject matter everyone likes a good puzzle
  i dont think set theory has a low barrier to entry  you havent been conditioned to avoid the subject matter  once you get to university math youre not taught to hate calculus anymore
    most books that derive the subject from first principles and dont take things too quickly are easy to get into anyone can pick up intro to mathematical logic or intro to analysis or any other junior to firstyeargrad level book and go through it these books have a much different way of presenting material due to their emphasis on logical consistency and inference rather than algorithmic plugandchug exercises
  guess what variable crunching is what real math is about deep down  you will not escape from calculation it is the mathematical equivalent of experimentation in physics   mathematicians do not spend their days in deep thought and suddenly come up with clean theoretical relationships between objects they work with many examples then observe how they relate to one another try to infer relations and then try to prove these conjectures  all of that involves lots of calculations not necessarily computing integrals but maybe computing reducing long algebraic expressions multiplying matrices drawing huge diagrams and checking commutation computing intersections of ideals of polynomials numerical simulations etc

hijacking this thread to ask how to ace data structures
why are vocabulary and verbal tests in general more heavily gloaded than culturefai tests like block design and digit span
  id guess because they only test a small aspect of the brains function  short term memory and visuospatial ability vocabulary tests memory but also indirectly how much you have read which means its testing attention curiosity and comprehension
  its also interesting that vocabulary is more correlated with certain performance subtests than performance subtests are with one another

so many meds here im impressed    are we the chad profession
  no chad profession is being born well connected and trained from a young age in the social skills and culture signals necessary for a successful career in finance     med students are cucks unless they actually enjoy it in which case theyre wellpayed working stiffs whose chadness is entirely dependent on personality and looks
  workloads got you bitter it seems if youre in the us you shouldnt be complaining for the money youll get as a doctor
  im not bitter i just dont think mds are inherently chad     maybe the real issue here is our differing definitions of chad
will take step1 sometime next year    currently studying robbins pathology this damn book is long will probably take me another month to get through then planning to do guyton physiology before starting ufap    i feel like im doing okay but if i study more than 5 hours i get headaches when i take the exam i just want to avoid failing any questions due to lack of knowledge is it even possible will i have to do much more than ufap even after the enormous pathology/physiology books
  youre gonna miss some questions due to lack of knowledge unless youre autistically smart and remember everything you read or something     how about getting a qbank and answering questions based on some subjects you feel youve read a lot about and seeing how your knowledge level holds up in that setting which would answer your question as to whether or not reading robbins is enough i think probably not but im not you     you a usmd/do or an img
  not inherently chads but a lot of the guys in my class are 62 and gym all the time
  yeah i probably fit that description too but im not chad
  years chad just means youre sexually and socially dominant being handsome tall athletic and charismatic are the prerequisites you can be a poor chad
  i did some cardiology questions and didnt miss any besides those that involved pharmacology i was often complimented for my memory by people at med school but i suppose the real challenge will be to remember everything in biochem/pharma  img from a uk med school
  my definition of chad includes money    i dunno theres a lot of kind of quiet nerdy shorter brown guys in my class and i can feel them deciding the type of person i am as soon as they see me they assume we have nothing to talk about because im a big boi white i lift etc and it disappoints me because we really could be friends if they didnt immediately decide i was a douchebag does that sound like a chad emotion to you it does not sound like one to me but i have it
  just do sketchy bro
  eh im the same but at the same everyone assume im a thug

  lmao youre gonna be a hilarious attending if you keep the accent
  gym two to three hours then adderall  not even lying years ago i was a fitizen and one of my friends on that fitness website was doing this and went into vtach and passed out woke up in the hospital username was brotagonist its a good schedule but dont combine the chems with exercise     im also img at a uk med school are you at st georges also
  gym before adderall i take it with breakfast thanks for concern
  half life is 10 hours
  day is 24 hours
  if you do two hours of exercise youre going to be tachycardic the rest of the day add adderall to it and you will fuck your shit up why dont you try it and see what happens but it is a really stupid idea
  oh i see what youre saying dont worry i am very lazy at the gym
  what are you using to review other than uworld to get up to 60 percent i just took a set and got a 38 fml
  you know what it starts off really fucking shitty just keep in mind that its a learning resource and not necessarily for assessment those percentiles include people who are grinding blocks the day before their test     i tried to get through a first nonclass related pass of pathoma first aid and sketchy before my dedicated and got like 95 done with all of them before class started needing my attention more     i honestly might fail out of this year because i spent too much time on board material and if that happens ill just drive my bike in front of a bus or something lmao
  im also like 80 done with uw after doing 2040 qs per day for the past few months so its been a slow and unsatisfying progress
  dont do that i was studying and as an aside went to v to look up an old video game i found it and it turned out another medical student was looking for it i looked at his reddit history and he killed himself bc his wife cheated i hate to say but if i found out my gf cheated i would be happy bc she would no longer be my responsibility    anyway i have a friend that repeated and he still got im interviews in decent programs with only a 213 step 1 dont repeat how about you focus on class instead and get to it during dedicated    
  whats your percentage after the 80 percent comletion im at 60 percent completion with a 4550 percent range
  upper 50s on average im starting to get 70 on individual 40 q blocks a couple times a week
  honestly man its not like theres anywhere you should be with uw even if there was its not like youre spontaneously going to jump ahead in progress just make sure you read all of the answer explanations and make an anki deck of your knowledge gaps
  anki  fuck yea i need to go through that more   right now i have uworld on tutor mode then go to the page on first aid and annotate/highlight the information
  alright sounds good gl bro
can an fmg match anasthesia i just wanna come to the us bros
  
tell people im an fmg  they turn their noses up at  tfw oxford med school graduate
  howd you prep for step 1  did you do a foundation year
  expecting any respect for your stupid britbong prestige school in america    yeah nobody cares fagboy
  britbongs are the progenitors of prestige you know havard is just oxbridge larping
  oxbridge sounds like a gay bdsm night club
  whats that mnemonic again  cant see cant bee cant let others be  cant see cant pee craves to be free    cant flee cant see insert the pee
so hey guys retard here  is this actually going to work or is it just clickbait and if so what kind of improvements are we talking about across the board recharge rate at the cost of max capacity    
bump
what the fuck is a solid state battery    im ashamed im asking
  i googled it    its just a battery with solid metallic components no lead acid or li ions     from wiki    advantages edit  solidstate battery technology is believed to be capable of higher energy density34 because of their tolerance to higher temperatures avoiding the use of materials in current batteries that may be dangerous or toxic35    because most liquid electrolytes are considered to be flammable solid state batteries are believed to be safer as fewer safety systems are needed a more compact battery is possible improving energy and power densities135    solidstate battery technology is also believed to allow for faster recharging for electric cars3637 in addition higher voltage and longer cycle life is possible with solidstate batteries
  okay neat but what was limiting us from doing it beforehand
a
  wrong
  sorry
  none can carry any load its the computer screen that carries the load you silly
b
  apparently the answer is a though and i cant figure out why i have a mechanical engineering degree too i guess you would assume the load which is distributed over the entire shelf would be evenly distributed and therefore be right over the support so a wouldnt have any bending stress but whats the strength of that support material how do we know the shelf cant handle bending stress better than that support piece can handle shear
  a
  b would transfer most of the load from the shelf to the support making the support more likely to fail a is correct because the support takes some of the load off the shelf but not all of it and the reduced length allows it to carry more weight
  doesnt this depend on the material properties like compression vs tension strength
  no shear strength  no yield strength  no dimensions  no loading diagram  no indication of joint types    not a lot to work with
  with a there isnt torque on the tip of the support
  assuming a single point load on the end point what about distributed loads even or uneven distribution what about single point loads at different places  b will most likely to fail at the shelf root or at the support failing while a always spreading the load between the root and the support the biggest load on the support at a is when the load point is in the middle but the shorter support beam means its specific load bearing is much higher than b supports specific load bearing
b puts a lot more leverage on the diagonal support it is a longer lever and therefore puts more bending stress on the vertical piece i still like b better though if it was real and not just a math problem a would have a weakness in the screws if it was wood where the shelving connects to the back if you put something heavy on the front end you would have no support of shelf going clockwise
  i object in that case leverage is 0 at the root hence no torque induced load at that point  we need a basic cad draw module next to tex so us engineers can do better explanations maths is overrated anyways
wow so many physics and math majors in this thread no wonder you clueless fucks cant find a job if you cant even solve such a simple problem as this the correct answer is you go to the person asking you to design the shelf and ask them what material they want and what the load distribution is you fucking retards if the material cant handle shear forces at the base then its b if it cant handle high compression through the support then its a if the weight is at the base then its a if its at the tip then its b or any combination of those two factors now fuck off brainlets i said full cream not fucking onions
simple question really imagine the beam isnt there then they both have the same center of mass now imagine you add only a small beam to the upper left corner you wont change the center very much by making it longer and shifting it to the b position you not only add weight to the construction but heavily shift its center of mass to the right so assuming its an ideal rigid body a will always carry more weight without falling down
  btw    t physicist     mes and other retards who couldnt actually reason it out itt btfo
  what size and shape is the load
  thats wrong
  id like to say b but that smaller support on a looks tempting and the shelf is thicker anyway so it doesnt seem like the shelf is ever going to break so the as smaller support would need more weight to snap than bs longer support    maybe
  those hideous fucking shelves  obviously none of you queers has ever done carpentry
  im not jesus christ
  itt brainlets unable to answer the question and instead trying to muddy the waters by spraying out lots of superfluous secondary questions like a squid sprays out ink
  can somebody post the equations that measure the real answer and on which variables it depends
  you guys should learn to read questions properly it is asked which can carry the heaviest load so all the anons talking about unkown variables need to fuck off the question already implies that the load will be loaded so that each shelf will carry its theoretical maximum capacity this means that for a all load will be put exactly onto the middle and for b all load will be on the outer edge because these are the points where each shelf will have its maximum capacity exhausted     because of this a is the correct answer
  there has been more than one carpenter
assuming exact same materials of construction and evenly balanced load i would answer that b would handle more load due simply due to the placement of the brace gives it much better leverage   try to hold a heavy box on your shoulder and hand in the center of to bottom of the box then move your hand out to the end of the box and see which is easier
  assuming  ill be the one laughing when then shelf breaks and hits someones neck killing them and causing you to go to jail for negligence  ill laugh like this hah hahah hahhuuuu aaaaaahahaaaa aaayyyeee lmao
this one    /thread
  nope theyre all jesus its a miracle
assuming square crosssection on both beams shelf and support and same material properties    axial compression is preferred to a bending moment imagine a tube of paper stronger to compress length ways than as a bridge    assuming a uniform distributed load udl a will have more force resolved by the support b will have a greated bending moment on the shelf    under a udl im standing underneath a a point load such as a hanging sign on the end id take b    t not autistic
  what a shitty painting
  what about buckling the diagonal brace could be fixed to the beam rather than simply being pinned
    this physics  maths undergrad genocide now
  fu my gay retarded nam vet son painted it for me      what is compression   fixed or pinned its still being compressed which is better then shear stressing as in the shelf
  what shelf has a square cross section its likely a thin board
  those are the support you put the plancks on them at least two each planck length
  a only if the load is placed before the intersecting joints anything past that and its better to use b  educated guess
  how would you do the genocide though you cant even count to 6 gorillion
  b because it creates a larger torque because of the larger distance of the beam from the wall
  depends where you put the load this is the objective answer
  that would be your mother
solved it b is correct
  kek has a good laugh
  a because supports take more force to buckle
  wrong  a is the only correct answer
  what do you mean buckle
  buckle  /ˈbəkəl/  verb  gerund or present participle buckling    2 bend and give way under pressure or strain  the earth buckled under the titanic stress  synonyms warp bend twist curve distort contort deform more
  is it maybe because the length of the bracer of a is shorter meaning its tensile strength holds up better
   without knowing the point of application or material strength you cant say for sure
  nibba u want a phd
  without knowing the point of application or material strength you cant say for sure    the question isnt asking about the point of application or the material strength a good engineer doesnt ask questions when faced with an easy problem because he knows what hard problems look like
  ok you do the math and prove that there is a case where the point of application and material strength matter between a and b ill be here waiting when you get back with an answer that provides no value
  a good engineer doesnt ask questions  this is what causes bridges to collapse and kill 20 people
  why dont you find one so we can see if you really are following along here
  when faced with an easy problem  only reading half a sentence is what causes bridges to collapse and kill 20 people      doesnt know what buckle means   thinks they can pretend they are the smart one  ok
  buckle doesnt have a meaning in physics its normgroid speak
  see attached image  
  only reading half a sentence  not paying attention to every bit of information    in other words    doesnt ask questions    are you trying to prove my point
  im going to blatantly troll for yous by straight out ignoring what words mean and making illogical leaps    ok i guess here is your you
  but its not stop spreading disinfo like the rest of this thread
  why not smaller support looks more sturdy
  is very smart  doesnt directly answer question    obviously youre right but this is clearly supposed to be answerable as is devoid of the qualifications you provided
  if the material cant handle shear forces at the base then its b if it cant handle high compression through the support then its a  so its a because clearly the base is thicker than the support if you actually look at the drawing
  this is right
  but this is clearly supposed to be answerable as is devoid of the qualifications you provided  wtf how do you figure that it all depends on load distribution and member properties the question makes no assumptions so there are many variables missing
  where do you want to place the load fuckalooo     it seems that horizontal part will brake according to it
    this alone makes this the best thread in ages
just think about the cross product of the radius from the point of rotation and the force applied by the support it is larger as r gets larger so the right picture should be correct
  the one on the right gets less compressive stress but is more prone to buckling
  brainlet here    best i can do
  its a  you have to look at the problem in terms of levers a has the shorter leaver arm so it can hold more weight given the same material strengths
  to clarify the load youre trying to lift or not lift with the lever is the point of failure which will be where either the horizontal or diagonal beams attach to the vertical or to eachother a is the less efficient lever therefore it takes more force to lift the load ie more weight to break it
    damn youre dumb
  go on explain how im wrong ill wait
  a draw bending moments for both itll become obvious
  but there are no bms passing through b because the diagonal strut means the horizontal one cant bend
  a is the less efficient lever therefore it takes more force to lift the load  so there will be more force in the beam a for an equivalent load
  a less efficient lever is less efficient at leveraging force at the fulcrum which im assuming to be the most likely point of failure for a shelf
  the fulcum being where the shelf meets the wall definitely not the case in these types of questions it is looking for failure of the support beam
  yes because thats where the point of failure tends to be on shelves in real life of course its a different matter if the question is asking about failure of the support beam
  in that case would it be incorrect to assume a fulcrum in the center of the support beam resulting in the same answer shorter lever  stronger
  fulcrum in the center of the support beam resulting in the same answer shorter lever  stronger  kiiiind of buckling failure is the most likely failure so yeah a shorter beam resists the buckling forces
  the bigger gap a girl has between her ass and her legs the less support she gets from me     /thread
  fulcrum in the center of the support beam  i guess i was thinking about it this way therell be some sort of deformation before it snaps as this happens concave and convex sides form on the beam the concave side being an area of compression around which the bending force is directed causing the convex side to be pulled apart i dont know if this can technically be called a fulcrum but it kind of serves the same function  anyways the shorter beam being less vulnerable to buckling failure is clearly right just imagine breaking a stick then trying to break one of the shorter broken pieces
  anyways the shorter beam being less vulnerable to buckling failure is clearly right    indeed but without knowing the structure or material of the beam we cant technically assume buckling failure if its a thinwalled cylindrical beam its possible to fail compressively before buckling in that case b would be better since it will have less compressive forces
  true it could also be made of a pressure sensitive explosive in which case b would also be better
  clearly a5 faggot
why do colleges still look at gpa as if they werent highly volatile    grades are completely dependent on the teacher a fresh teacher will likely give higher grades than a teacher whos been teaching the same lessons year after year points on assignments can be removed because they werent turned in on time in which these policies can be shifted by the teacher students with younger teachers will probably receive higher grades individual teachers also act on their biases its been shown that teachers grade males more harshly than females they also grade more attractive people better the teachers who you encounter in high school ultimately decided if you go to college or not and often times its just bull shit teacher garbage and not about learning for example    student a could be a slow learner he could have a hard time picking up topics but ultimately gets becomes a god at it near the end of the school year  student b could be a fast learner he could not study and cram at the last second and walk out of the school year with very little knowledge and understanding
a and b have a test next friday a is a slow learner b crams for the test the test goes by a receives a d and b receives a b student a didnt pick up the material fast enough and ultimately gets a d on his record you repeat this multiple times for a semester with slight changes a week of the second semester goes by and a has a solid c but then suddenly they grasp everything taught in the class he now gets as on his tests meanwhile student b continues cramming and has an average of a the school year ends and what do you end up with student a has a deeper understanding of the concepts and a low gpa and student b walks away with nothing but a high gpa    gpa doesnt mean how much knowledge you grasp all it seems to show is how fast you were able to pick up the knowledge before the test when are the test dates oh yeah they vary between teacher to teacher and state to state what should really happen is one big test at the very end of the school year this way slow learners are represented fairly student b goes to college and student a is digging ditches    there are so many variables that go into gpa yet colleges look at it and treat it as if it were stable the average gpa has gone up yet the scores on standard tests have stayed the same girls get higher gpas than boys and its probably due to teacher bias
because giving a standard test to let people in uni is something monkey south americans and a couple european countries do so clearly the us cant also do it otherwise theyll get our diseases
im surprised op didnt mention politics a conservative state will likely have more conservative teachers and therefore harsher grading
  good students dont have a volatile gpa you fucking brainlet frog posters confirmed retarded
    i suppose a good student would be able to overcome all these obstacles thats why rate my professor seems so popular these days
  how is a good male student supposed to get around a whiny strict old liberal woman who doesnt have a passion for teaching how does gpa get around teacher bias now say youre entire life you were taught by only these types of people what would your gpa say would you have a high gpa or a low gpa
  you say what they want to hear thats why college is a joke in ways stem really are the only classes where you learn some shit and demonstrate your ability without politics getting in the way too much everything else is basically state your opinion in a certain format without spelling and gramatical errors    t insert socially unacceptable political beliefs who got a 40 in college
  who exactly can a math prof affect your gpa are you talking about gender studies or something
  small things like forgetting symbols that have no real impact on the operations themselves a female would probably be given the benefit of the doubt where as a male would probably be graded harsher there is a reason why when names are abstracted away males perform higher teacher bias
  but studying the material and doing good on tests regardless if you werent stupid you would know this
  student c could be a fast learner and become an elder god by the end of the school year because he retains the information and is very knowledgeable and shits all over you and your imaginary students    suck a dick fren
  shortcut realistically graduate schools look for letters of recommendation research experience grades and gre scores in order of importance though gre scores could be the first filter to a more holistic review grades might not reflect intelligence in a 1  1 fashion but what they are a pretty good measure of is seeing if you can deal with your peers and instructors such that even if theres hardship you can still succeed grad school is all about dealing with assholes and succeeding in the face of adversity that being said grades are not nearly as important as having well known people in your department vouch for you    as far as undergrad grades are the closest thing to concrete evaluations they have of you prior to an interview you dont do anything of rigor prior to university and even in university its not until midway where you start doing anything that resembles what a university committee considers nontrivial hard work
          i made this graph to better explain the point im trying to make    student a is red and student b is blue the gray lines are the days the tests are given and the green circles are there to better guide your eyes towards the intersections between the test days and the students understanding of the subject    you count up the points there are 4 points where student a is below student b and two where a is higher student a walks away from the class with a higher understanding of the subject but has a low gpa and student b has crammed before every test and has a higher gpa
  no one cares about your understanding being able to cream shows that you work well under pressure and short deadlines which is all that matters
  the potential gain in scouting the difference between these two isnt worth the energy spent for a more fine analysis and honestly your student a example seems suspect id sooner suspect that student a was just lazy because classes are supposed to be introducing you to new topics all the time so according to your description he should still be falling behind
now imagine if there was only one big final at the very end of the school year student a would receive a higher gpa than student b which is fair because it represent the amount of understanding this is assuming student b is cramming for no reason every wednesday    point is the timing of tests given matter a lot in the grade of an individual class the timing of a test is often given to the teacher which is often done on a weekly basis so the teacher has things to do    if there was only 1 big final then the student who understands the most should be the one who scores higher which is what should happen right
   assuming this is something that frequently occurs   assuming it is worth the administrative trouble and student stress
  id argue that weekly tests are a heavier burden of student stress and resources
  habits become nondramatic after enough time
what classes youre taking helps too  dual enrolled  get a b in a junior level college course as a freshman  this counts the same as a b in remedial math  valedictorian took easier classes to get as  jokes on them because i left hs with half a bs already done but still  and then after i graduated they started inflating the gpas even more where ap courses get bonus points so i wouldve been even further behind for trying to go further ahead
  this
youtube video lectures replace public schools when
    sounds like student a is low iq and student b is high iq
  gpa isnt supposed to represent iq or how fast you pick up topics its there to see how much information youve retained a high iq baby shouldnt get a high gpa and a low iq adult shouldnt get a low gpa especially when the adult will have more information
  gpa isnt supposed to represent iq or how fast you pick up topics  thats exactly the point of gpa
  the american economic system selects for people who accomplish goals     this whole a more qualified civic populace thing is bullshit its precollege job training youre just getting sorted if you want to get sorted into a higher paying job you need to show you can accomplish goals    in a classroom your goal is to get an a accomplish it     dont bitch about your teacher dont whine about an unfair situation or poor test question writing dont be a pussy find what it takes to get the a and do that thing thats the only way to generate value
  why shouldnt i whine when someone who has less understanding than me gets into a better school because she lives on the west coast and had hippie teachers because of how gpa is calculated
  because its a waste of energy and probably an ego defense
  because the us education system is a money racket
  elaborate
  it matters more on the school and the department small private schools tend to give out 40s like nothing while large state schools often curve low the sciences at my school curve to around a 28 to 32 while engineering gets 3336 and then the arts is like 3740 for everyone

  divide the right hand side by 21 to simplify it to 1e9t  159/21  1e9t  now subtract 1 from the right hand side  159/21  1  e9t  multiply both by 1 to get 0242857  e9t  now take the natural log of the left hand side to get ln0242857  9t  divide both by 9 to get t    if you dont know about natural logs please look it up because youre going to need it
  cant express my gratitude enough ive been looking through the worked example and trying the same method however my answers dont seem reasonable pic is the worked example
  that should say multiply both by negative one so youre not trying to take the natural log of a negative number
  how did you try to do it
  i know i completely ignored the negative signs at the bottom ignore that this is how my equation turned out
  should my loge at the bottom of the fraction instead be loge
  why are you dividing it by log e  this may be my ignorance of math speaking but all you should be doing is taking the natural log of the right hand side
  the reason ive taken this loge is because it was previously written as e9t as shown in the example given to me in order to bring down the 9t it must be written as 9tloge after rearranging for 9t i divide the other side by loge however i think i made the mistake here of not making it a negative
  all you have to do to bring down the 9t is take the natural log of e9t    natural log will tell you what you raise e to to get a certain number since in this case you want e9t to be equal to 1 i/21 you take the natural log of the right hand side to find what e is raised to to get 1  i/21 the natural log of the right hand side is going to be equal to 9t since the natural log of e9t  9t    im sorry if im explaining this badly
  please dont apologies i appreciate that youre trying to help when entering ln1159/21 into a calculator im getting the same answer 141 however when i divide this by 9 to get t my answer is still a negative value 015725

i think there are two types of brainlets in this world    the most common ones are those who grew up not giving a shit about basic mathematics and end up disliking it    the other ones are people like me who even though we tend to suck most of the time we try to become as good as brainacs and get average grades with a lot of effort
im definitely the second type of brainlet i study a lot of subjects and i get average grades i only study for 1 week tho if i studied more i would get better grades second type of brainlets hate the first type
  second type of brainlets hate the first type    indeed i can tolerate some level of ignorance when doing a group homework yet i cant stand brainlets not giving a shit about learning or becoming better they usually end up failing the semester as always
  in this day and age with the internet ignorance is a choice and people are still choosing ignorance and i cant stand those people
  when i was in high school i studied a lot and i became slightly overaverage with time
  same but on my case that would depend of the difficulty of the course

how do i find the percentage/rate of a group if they fall into 2 or 3 labels that have their own percentage rates     its confusing to explain because i actually dont know what formula to use     for example  group a is 69 x   group b is 69 x  group c is 69 x  is someone is abc what is the /ratio/rate that they are x     it cant be 69 am i wrong to question that number if someone falls into 3 categories that their majority  is x it should be increasing right  it should be something like individual abc is 90 x instead of 69    please someone point me to a formula or rule does it even exist
i hope asking questions like this isnt against the rules im not from this board but im not asking help for a homework question i wanted to point something out to someone i was having a conversation with it then i didnt know how to pull out the number i was looking for
for more context this might help someone understand the problem im talking about like voting rates among demographics   lets say men voted 55 red   and people over the age of 60 voted 80 red   since men vote red more then women and old people vote red more then young people that must mean that old men vote red higher than 55 and 80 right or am i wrong to assume this from a mathematical point of view     if someone can help me solve this or point me to a formula itd be better if they use the 69 example i first posted since that has to do with my personal question
  probability of an old man voting red is pvoted red and male and old/pmale and old theres not enough information to calculate the value look up conditional probability to learn more
if abc are all independent then the probability they fall in all three or even two is 0
  you are so dumb

filled with /pol/turds  after trump won the election
  but these people youre thinking of arent scientists at best some are former scientists i admit i know nothing about laurence krauss and whether he is a working scientist
  just because people like science doesnt mean that they like attention seekers who have a science degree
more like  because he uses his past expertise in an unrelated field to pretend his opinion on something is science  name one scientist/popscientist sci hates who doesnt do this

help me out here /sci/    i have proven that if integer z is square and z23z3 is square then z must be 1    i want to show that if 1/z is square and 1/z2  3/z  3 is square then 1/z must be 1 square here means rational m/n with m and n both square    this is true i have proven it by a really ugly separate way using elliptic curves how can i in a nicer fashion get from the second case to the first thanks
  if z 1/z and z2 3z3 are square then id imagine  z 1/zz2 3z 31/z2 3z 3 forces 1/z2 3/z3 to be square  alternatively set x1/z  then again i know fuck all what youre talking about and your definition of square is circular
  i briefly defined what it meant for a rational number to be square that is it is m/n with m and n square integers in the regular sense    z 1/z does not equal z23z31/z23z3 and 1/z23/z3 is not the reciprocal of z23z3 if it was then the problem would be trivial
show there is no entire function such that math fx1exp2ipi/x/math for math1leq xleq 2/math
  if z is square by the definition given 1/z is square  substituting 1/z by x x is square and x23x3 imply x is one which implies x11/z so z1    he never said it was the reciprocal
  the statement  z is square and z23z3 is square implies z is 1  has only been proven for integers    1/z is not an integer
i cant do math right now can someone help me  whats 2090 divided by 2 with a difference of 100
  an entire function is equal to its taylor series  calculate the taylor series around the point a3/2 then show that this series doesnt converge if z goes to 0
    to clarify    the following has been proven  let z be a square integer with z23z3 a square integer then z1    what i want to prove  let z be a square integer with 1/z23/z3 a rational number with square numerator and square denominator then z1
  daily reminder that if youre not getting a phd in algebraic geometry you are probably a very dull and uninteresting person
i dont understand the concept of dummy variables in multiple regression how can your model be accurate if you randomly assign values to different levels
  they arent randomly assigned you assign a dummy variable when you know something is up for instance if you were trying to study health outcomes over a period of time which includes a terrorist attack then you need a dummy variable for that attack so the model doesnt ascribe the sudden change to other means
  hmm okay my expansion about x3/2 is pretty ugly looking at it when z0 doesnt easily show it to not converge

  thank you this is the bit id proven
  merely tautological masturbation  all math is tautological masturbation you pleb
  doesnt every intro logic book start with some basics about formal language and logical semantics
what is the derivative of a complex valued function we know the derivative of a real valued function is the slope of the line tangent or rate of change but what does it actually mean to take a complex derivative i read it has something to do with rotation
  for a real valued function mathf/math the derivative at a point matha/math tells you the slope of the affine function mathgx  fa xa  fa/math that best approximates mathf/math in a small neibhoorhood around matha/math    for complex valued functions its the exact same
  fxfxδxfx)))/δx   fxδxfx  fxδx  iow a differentiable function f looks like an affine transformation in a small neighbourhood    multiplication by a complex number corresponds to rotation and uniform scaling so fzδz is just δz transformed by rotation and uniform scaling in particular the argument angle of fzδz depends only upon the argument of δz and not its magnitude and the magnitude of fzδz depends only upon the magnitude of δz and not its argument iow the mapping is conformal preserves shape
  im a complete newfag to /sci/ why the aversion to khan academy
is this the correct interpretation of a convolution operator with a measure im a little shaky on how they define mu so im not sure if this is accurate
  could you recommend me one straight and to the point do you know one that covers the cumulative hierarchy im a cs major and im really struggling with this
  its explanations are absolute trash tier
can someone on this board explain binary numbers to me in the most transient way possible none of the tutorials online can break it down to me and i dont want to waste time surfing through different content    t brainlet selflearning js
  first look at the right most digit of a binary number if its 1 you sum 1 if its zero you skip then look at the number to its left if its 1 you sum two if its zero you skip then you look at the one to the left if its one you sum four if its zero you skip  and so on think of it as a command for finding a number  making a binary number is the exact opposite see the largest power of two that fits in the number then subtract it and write a one see the new largest power of two that fits put as many zeroes as you skipped powers then put a one and subtract the power from the original do it again until the number is zero
  base 2 number system has 2 digits to manipulate those being 01 so its obviously useful to explain high and low voltage outputs with this system youre processor is an integrated circuit that is made up of logic gates these logic gates are made of transistors that are sort of like switches that achieve combinational logic like and or xor because of their arrangement in the logic gate these gates make circuits which are connected to pins in the chip and manipulated by some exterior system so when it receives power or does not 01 a particular outcomes is achieved and outputted to another pin you should probably be more specific on what about it you dont understand
  when would you ever use binary in javascript unless youre doing some weird ass subnetting
  ask yourself this why is ten the first whole number with two digits instead of just one    the reason should be obvious its because we have ten digits to work with 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 9 when we reach ten the representation of our number transcends into the tens place because there are no unique digits left to put in the ones place    the same thing happens at the transition from nineteen to twenty we run out of digits to put in the ones place again so we have to carry the increment operation to the tens place and increment the 1 thats already there    then a very similar thing happens at the transition from ninetynine to one hundred we run out of digits to put in the tens place so we have to carry the one to the hundreds place    this system  of using ten distinct digits and carrying the one to the xs place when we run out of digits  where x is the first free zeroed place value  is called the decimal number system because there are ten digits we can use before we run out and have to carry    so in the binary number system there are only two digits we can use before we run out and have to carry 0 and 1 which means the place values for each digit are powers of 2 instead of powers of ten    counting up from 0    0  1  1    1  1  carry the one the ones place is full   10 remember this number is actually two in binary not ten    10  1  11 three in binary not eleven    11  1  full 1s place carry the one   10  10  full 10s twos place carry the one   100 four not hundred    100  1  101 five    101  1  carry full 1s place   100  10   110 six    110  1  111 seven    111  1  carry full 1s place   110  10  carry full 10s twos place   100  100  carry full 100s fours place   1000 eight    1000  1  1001 nine    et cetera
  can someone on this board explain binary numbers to me in the most transient way possible  instead of counting using the symbols 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 9 you follow the same rules but only using the symbols 0 and 1
  
  really good and intuitive explanation of binary numbers youre a good tutor
  youre gonna get bummed in the shower
  binary numbers work exactly the same as base 10 or base 12 except there are only two numbers once you reach two a symbol for two doesnt exist so you write the next digit over as 1 just like how a symbol for the number ten doesnt exist so you just have to write a 1 in the second slot and have the first slot over to zero    all counting and arithmetic works exactly the same except there are no symbols for numbers over 1 so you have to make do    the reason computers use binary is because its incredibly easy to write logic and math circuits that work in binary since there are only two possible numbers per wire and each wire represents a digit    say you want to represent the number 100 with electricity youre a literal retard so you decide to have 100 wires that each can be turned on or off if the lightbulb at the end of wire 27 is on then that means the number is 27 but then you take some smart guy pills and you realize that you actually only need two sets of ten wires wires one through ten representing the tens place and wires 11 through 20 referees ting the one place cool but then you take someega genius pills and you realize you actually only need 7 wires since you can just have wire 7 be 64 wire 6 be 32 wire 5 be 16 etc all the way down the line and if the pattern of on and off wires is 1100100 then you know you have 100 because thats the only pattern that can repressing 100
just watch this 
  its basically a sum of 2n over all set bits in the binary number so for example for the binary number 110101 bits 0 2 4 and 5 are set bit 0 is the rightmost bit 5 is the leftmost so you have 20  22  24  25  1  4  16  32  53
  you do exactly what the guy on the picture does except with 2s instead of 10s    bonus  for hexadecimal you replace the 10s with 16s
numbers 09 have 1 digit 10 has 2 digits we use base 10 there is no single digit number representing 10     numbers 01 have 1 digit 10 has 2 digits computers use base 10 there is no single digit number representing 10
  thanks i got it down in 5 mins i never came across binary coming up in k12 and it was like my brain couldnt compute a base 2 number system watching those trivial youtube videos did jack shit
  thanks anon finally got it understood i wish base 2 had more prevalence rather than just in computers
there are 10 kinds of people in this world those who understand binary and those who dont
  finally the most transient explanation possible
  we use base 10 what does this mean it means we use 10 digits 09 and carry on 10 what is 10 1 in the 10s place 0 in the 1s place otherwise said at 100 111  100101 thats how the place value system works its the same in every other base    in binary 11111111  1248163264128  255 there are 8 places therefore your max value is 2n 1
0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10    0  1  10    0  0  1  1  10  2  11  3  100  4  101  5  110  6  111  7  1000  8  1001  9  1010  10  1011  11  1100  12  1101  13  1110  14  1111  15  10000  16  10001  17  10010  18  10011  19  10100  20  10101  21  10110  22  10111  23  11000  24  11001  25  11010  26  11011  27  11100  28  11101  29  11110  30  11111  31    op pic is not binary
most electronics use binary instructions at their most basic level because the 2 states accomodate whether electricity is flowing or not some gizmos may have some degree of accuracy in variance so could be engineered to have 3states or greater but 2 states in on or off is the most reliable     computer language tends to use hexidecimal base16  0123456789abcdef  0000  0  0001  1  0010  2  0011  3  0100  4  0101  5  0110  6  0111  7  1000  8  1001  9  1010  a  1011  b  1100  c  1101  d  1110  e  1111  f    this is because a single binary number is called a bit and 4bits or 4 digits is called a byte and a byte may be a hex value from 015 16 values  1 byte 4bit  16  2 byte 8bit  255 127  127  4 byte 16bit  65535 32767  32767  8 byte 32bit  4294967295 2147483647  2147483647  16 byte 64bit  a gigagorillion    there were 8bit computers and video games then 16bit then 32bit and now 64bit a 64bit register can hold a retardedly large number so its unlikely the next step to 128bit will come within the next 40 years
  brainlet burbling
    a programmer once taught me binary using my hand its pretty intuitive this way think of your fingers as powers of 2 ie your right thumb is 20 your right index finger is 21 and so on your right pinky is 24 ie 16     you can construct any whole number by summing which fingers are up the 1 and not counting which fingers are down the 0 so 100 is 4 since your thumb and index finger are down the zeroes and you dont add the respective values 1 for the thumb and 2 for the index finger but your middle finger is up the 1 so you count 4 if you add your right ring finger you add the next power of 2 which is 8 so you got 12 for 1100    with only the five fingers on one hand you can count up to 31 as seen by this list  when all your fingers are up binary is just powers of 2
  if unsigned its simple  signed it gets tricky
  its just base 2 which means it only uses two symbols for counting 0 and 1  if its signed then the first digit is negative   thats the quick rundown
  if its signed then the first digit is negative  what is twos complement
  where do you need binary in js because answer is nowhere
if i electrocute myself enough can i develop an immunity to it
  yes happens with electrolysis and water as eventually you wont be able to do electrolysis anymore with even an infinite amount of water in your room
  i doubt it like youd never develop an immunity to blunt force trauma in a million years
  yes  start with putting 2 aa batteries in series  every 3 days that pass you must put another battery in the circuit until your skin changes color  if you reach that point no electricity will pass through that part of your body anymore    congrats now youre the insulatorman
  this is an assassin technique     
  if i havent developed one then i dont hold out much help for anyone else  sorry op
thats like asking if you can build up an immunity to fall related injuries by jumping off a plane with a parachute and using a smaller parachute each time
  you actually could because your bones would become harder by breaking them
  no not if the volts/amps get high enough unless your skin was made out of ceramic and thick rubber even then special gases or vacuum barriers are needed in some cases eventually you will hit a point where you are simply vaporized but youll die long before you reach that level
yes video document your progress particularly when you get past 9 volts try ac and dc
  no youll likely become more sensitive to it    look up protein denaturation and electroporation
  healed fractures cant break again
  electrochemical/biomedical engineer here   yes your memory b cells develop antibodies to the electricity and you are technically immune but i dont think most people would call this an immunity as the nature of electricitys interaction with the bodys healthy cells is different then that of a typical trauma autoimmune viral bacterial helminth etc disease process   first of all you need to be an african american to develop these antibodies for some reason having dread locks helps with the initial insulation from the current which is what causes the damage not amp   next the color and material youre wearing matters quite a bit i recommend blacks again with the african american advantages of electricity immunity and blues   attitude matters too so go ahead and paint a nice yellow lightning bolt on your chest think of yourself as a lord of lightning or whatever helps you best visualize success     after youve got the correct outfit on the best first step i would say is to find a downed line somewhere or go out in a lightning storm with a big antennae     youre not going to develop antie antibodies antielectricity from low levels of current like licking a battery in fact most of the time theyve happened naturally its been downed lines and lightning strikes
  i dont understand how the word could is hypothetical  if you break your bones enough times for them to become hard enough then yes you could build up an immunity to falls from a certain height
  yes
  only if you start at the highest voltage first
  why dont you try and find out
  immunity to falls  was your mother ever frightened by a goat
is there a way to determine logically and/or scientifically what you should do with your life    what you should spend time on
  no
  yes  whatever you want to do more than other people
  whatever you want to do more than other people    lol no matter what your interests are there are at least 50 asians somewhere who are waaayyy more autistic about it than you are
  there is read books on decision theory game theory and rationality
  you need to have values first
    so it order to determine what is important enough to spend my time on i must decide first what is important enough for me to spend my time on    got it
  science  reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee  look man you may actually be too stupid for science but you owe it to the universe to make an attempt to understand just what this whole thing is all about man  so forget values and all that fucking unreliable bullshit and study science
  all of those assume you have an ultimate goal moron

  no if anything the backing for it has strengthened especially as the history of the ama and other organizations has become better documented by numerous authors    knowledge of microorganism pleomorphism as he and arthur kendall discovered is now widely accepted and we also know there are numerous cancer causing viruses    look at tumor treating fields and novocure for more novocures device is really just a shitty rife machine but its fda approved and it has gotten clinical results

  further pulled right from wikipedia      i suspect the somatic cell theory of cancer is wrong in many cases and that naturally occurring lform bacteria are tuned towards virulence by irradiation or repeated chemical exposure they emit their viral form which is probably a retrovirus or they start putting out electromagnetic signals which alter the behavior of surrounding cells as the progression of cancer is cause mainly by faulty membrane mediated signal transduction concerning growth    rife identified the organism responsible for this other organisms have been found with their own properties over time sv40 hpv in some contexts etc i say organism because rife and kendalls virus was filterable and could be cultured on artificial media it didnt need cellular machinery to revert to its bacterial form
albert einstein the best
  neil degrasse tyson of course
how does one develop a better drive or simply accept achieving less    i thought i wanted go to grad school and do research and buy into the meme of making the world a better place but im in my junior year and with these classes and ungrad research im exhausted part of me still wants to go and try save the world but part of me just wants to jump ship to a easy meme degree like cs where i can just get an easy 95 job that pays well and let me live a life of ignorant bliss i know grad school will make this stuff look like childs play so how do all you people manage to push yourself through it
having the same issue bump
there is such a thing as providence or destiny there is the possibility that youll not gonna make it that things will not go as you wanted i had the possbility to do cool things but the pieces justdidnt fit and dont fit is not my fault is not your fault  its just life for over 20 years i think about commiting suicide but i dont even have the balls to do that i think the only thing that keeps me alive is that i dont have a gun    advice try to keep you mind at peace  procure good mental health  for example lower your work load see if you can take less courses talk to your professors if you have to pospone a course dont worry about it keep your mind at peace and youll be able to finish it in the next year or wherever
  i know i can take a lighter load and just take longer but issue is i feel a bit lost because i had held onto the dream of making my mark on the world via my research but now im not sure if to push myself through that hell let alone am i capable    i know i have the mental capacity but most grad and post doc people i know seem to be on the verge of suicide so im not sure how they push themselves through it
  never settle  track your time pomodoro method or similar  keep a consistent 8hr sleep schedule 117  give up extraneous activities and hobbies  learn to enjoy the tedious parts of studying  define a more specific end goal even if its totally unrealistic  make me proud anon
i have this but with my entire life whatever your choice is it will most likely not matter on the bigger scale but there is no bigger scale literally just be yourself you wont go wrong
  change the world  very few people accomplish this especially as the population size keeps increasing you want to change a world of nearly 8 billion people good luck with that you have to either be a total genius incredibly creative and good at thinking outside the box or just be in the right place at the right time to gain some special insight or a combination of these if you arent fascinated by the subject to the point where you spend at least some of your free time thinking about it with an enthusiastic curiosity you chances are much lower if you escape from your studies because theyre exhausting your chances are much lower   theres also this you have to utterly dedicate yourself to the goal your entire life thats how you achieve greatness through sacrifice and endless hard work if you dont have an uncompromising drive your chances of achieving this kind of goal are much lower    on the other hand you can go to gradschool and study something interesting without necessarily having to change the world or anything like that   exhausted  when you first get into a complex subject like biochem youre presented with a huge array of seemingly separate facts that you have to memorize its overwhelming and tiresome but if you slog through it and build up enough of a basis in the subject to get a general understanding you start seeing interesting connections and it gets better will it be interesting enough for you to spend your life on this stuff     i suggest that you talk to some professors and grad students about what their lives look like how much time do they spend working do they enjoy it would they go down the same path had they known what they know now  what do they dislike about their their job how often do the proffs see grad students quitting because they decide its not for them maybe try and find someone who quit and ask them why
  ive talked to a few grad students and gotten to know my old ochem professor pretty well they all said that grad school was/is the most miserable period of their live and they all had to overcome depression anxiety panic attack issues like alcoholism etc but everyone of them said that they did it because they loved the field they were studying in     the grad students are only able to keep pushing themselves because they tell themselves everything will be easy sailing and they will on top of the world after their postdocs but the one professor disagreed and said even most people who successfully get their phd will end up struggling to find good jobs that not only pay them well but allow them to carry out the research they truly want to do     that professor has kind of given up on research though hes ok just being an instructor that just teaches ochem year after year and being able to go home and actually get to spend time with his wife/kids
   you  but thanks for the advice anon    part of me is just thinking it might be better to try something like getting a masters i thoroughly enjoy being in a lab environment i fully recognize im not naturally gifted or the most dedicated so ill never end up being some huge recognizable person like einstein im ok with that because im fully aware that it takes teams of people to accomplish scientific achievements im ok not being the principal investigator of my own lab one day issue is i just dont want to be stuck in a lab tech position making 30k a year also and it doesnt seem like you can move up the ladder without getting your phd
  a big version of the image
  
  thanks anon 
  sure there are never easy answers to these kinds of questions of course financial security is also quite important you need to actually be able to save up for retirement id also put some thought into how automation will change things the last thing you want to do is put on all this time effort and money only to end up being replaced by machines having a phd will make you more resistant to this      
      i prefer wet work to dry but it seems like it would be smart to get a bs in software eng and then go for a masters in cheminformatics it just seems like it would be hell of alot easier to line up a good career writing the software for that automation
  what the fuck is undergrad research
  i know some programming work will be taken over by software as well there are already some basic examples of ai writing code  i definitely think resistance to automation should be a major considering for anyone trying to figure out a career path at this point not that im trying to make your derision even harder here    
why havent we mapped the stars and galaxies in that gap is it our own galaxy    also what software would you recommend to a newbie like me
is it our own galaxy    is it because of our own galaxy blocking it
bump
  we dont have any observatories on the north or south pole so the space up and down of earth is empty as far as mapping goes
what is that gap  the galactic north and south from earth  solar system north and south  also depending on what distances youre talking if its less then 100k ly you wanna be looking towards galactic center  if more towards the center of the local cluster of galaxies
  we dont have any observatories on the north or south pole so the space up and down of earth is empty as far as mapping goes    then i would imagine that gaia would have it covered also if you have 4 observatories in each hemisphere you could cover the whole sky since observatories arent looking at a fixed position and as nasas deep space network has it you can clearly see that we can cover pretty much all earths sky so i dont think thats why      approaching cosmic background radiation/ observable universe
    these are pictures of the big bang
  and as nasas deep space network has it you can clearly see that we can cover pretty much all earths sky  eh i dont know what kind of coverage the deep space network really has because almost nothing is out of the suns ecliptic plane
  they know there is an alien megastructure in those directions and they dont want you to know
    thats data from the sloan digital sky survey legacy it used one telescope in new mexico to collect the data this is hard to do because figuring out 3d position requires spectra
  ive discovered myself its because of our own milky way or better the immediate stars around us that block the view

if solar is 20 efficient as it has been in lab tests at turning solar energy into power wed only need to cover a land area about the size of spain to power the entire earth renewably in 2030   4chan wont allow me to post url you can google the paragraph to find the article    before the autists say sun isnt ist one spot 24/7 you could build a satellite solar beam array and power spots 24/7 pic shown
who is going to clean all those panels when they get dirty anon
beng electrical and electronic here  how would you get the power down from   space  wireless energy transfer is not efficient  laser would damage ozone and atmosphere  one plane flies in that area and it instantly dies and so does all wildlife  what happens if this one space link breaks will the world have no power till they fix it terrorist or rogue nation could fuck the world with one shot  who controls these global power networks one nation all the nations    20 in labs not real world environment a solar panel only lasts 10 years usually that means china would own the world due to rare resources to store that energy such as lithium    also you get a much greater power obtained from the sahara dessert with smaller area some people have already wrote papers on it    do you know how much it would cost to build a solar array that size and how long it would take we only just finished the iss and its tiny    wind hydro geothermal and nuclear at night is the right path until fusion power
solar is just nuclear energy with extra steps i say cut out the middle man
  two reasons    solar is cheaper then other forms of power and so power companies have lobbied to restrict installation size and profitability    grid storage is not currently sufficient to switch over to just solar    there is no reason we couldnt switch over to just solar in a few decades and we really should be trying ultimately there are only three sources of power on earth solar manmade fission and manmade fusion
  solar cells wear out retard how do you transfer the collected energy back to earth retard
  20 in labs not real world environment  you are high lab ratings are as high as 43 and even without being moved during the year a properly oriented panel can collect 73 of its rating
  so what your saying is they only managed to get 73 of the 43 lab efficiency   07343  31   oh wait 50 of the world isnt sunny everyday and warm its really cloudy and dull most the year  oh wait you have to move the solar panels on a rotating axis which is powered to get peak efficiency  then you have inverters have 95 efficiency if its a 100 watt panel then you have a 5 watt heater
  it only lasts 7years tops then everything has to be replaced
  on a positive note you could use a satellite like that to clear out the space junk around orbit you could use it to power magnets which could get rid of smaller debre and drag them to earth but you would have to armour all the mirrors and solar panels from a grain of metal having the impact of a bullet
    im assuming the b stands for brainlet   energy transfer is not efficient  80 for microwaves and rectennas    a rectenna is an antenna that rectifies electromagnetic radiation into dc current it is not an antenna that you stick in your rectum you dumb brainlet   would damage ozone and atmosphere  no laser doesnt work when its cloudy though    plane flies in that area and it instantly dies and so does all wildlife  not if the power density is low enough we dont do space based solar    controls these global power networks  who controls the worlds nuclear weapons thats politics who cares   in labs not real world environment  theres some variability from lab tests    445 is the record for solar conversion efficiency     china would own the world due to rare resources to store that energy such as lithium  china does not have vast reserves of lithium there are other battery chemistries out there link related uses common elements some of which are even food grade chemicals    flow batteries using vanadium are already starting to challenge pumped hydro energy storage  and since youre probably a dumb brainlet who thinks solar cells are made out of rare earth elements theres the possibility of making rectennas that operate at visible light frequencies what this means is that rather than using semiconductors we can use conductors which can be made from common elements in addition we can tune our antenna size to different wavelengths of light better than we can with semiconductors meaning we get better solar conversion efficiency  
  with cables whats your iq
  earth is flat
  wed only need to cover a land area about the size of spain to power the entire earth renewably in 2030  i dont think spain would agree to that
  no you illiterate i said that you can install a panel and leave it alone all year and collect 73 of its rating if you reposition it twice a year you get closer to 90 and if you have a tracking mount you get around 9598 based on the consumption of the tracker also clouds are factored into the solar insolation listed for a given area arent you pretending to be an engineer
  if the earth is flat who do glasses top over
you cant move the power without losing most of it and you cant store the power because theres nothing to store it into aside from shitty yuge batteries that suck more nigger dick than op  i do hope america and the west embrace radical environmentalism though it will make things easier
  actually you need way less area the world is already going solar maybe just not where you live
  all we have to do is converting atmospheric heat generated by sun into electricity and get some efficient energy storage where bunch of heated up water is quite good and cheap      usually people dont freeze with 30 for weeks so this is applicable
  you know whats fucked up about that picture is that lng the size of two or three of those housestop of pic would last for months
couldnt we just place panels strategically around the globe so while its dark in one timezone it would still be getting power from another area with panels that still has sun
  so while its dark in one timezone it would still be getting power from another area with panels that still has sun    serious transmission loss  if they figure out superconductor wires maybe
  only need to cover a land area about the size of spain  using only doesnt make it any less of a herculean task
finitely many people wish to divide an inheritance by turning to a judge  if not bribed the judge divides the inheritance equally  the amount given to person k is given by a continuous function which is monotonically increasing with respect to person ks bribe and monotonically decreasing with respect to everyone elses bribes  is it necessarily true that if person 1 makes his bribe small enough then everyone else can choose their bribes so that the judge divides the inheritance equally
  yes let all of them pick the same amount as bribe    proof  suppose they all choose their bribe equally yet the judge does not distribute the inheritance equally that wouldnt make any fucking sense  a contradiction in our assumption
is it possible that for a different combination of countries and organizations the euler diagram couldnt be at all constructed
no because you can just stretch that shit out like they did with vatican
  yes with 4 categories and countries that fit every combination of in and out for said categories for example       why are retards always so sure they have the right answer
  yes but they wont understand the explanation
  no it would take a life time
  no chance most of these isolated tribes are insanely low iq    being concerned that because of this cultural gap they were being cheated in trade the pirahã people asked daniel everett a linguist who was working with them to teach them basic numeracy skills after eight months of enthusiastic but fruitless daily study with everett the pirahã concluded that they were incapable of learning the material and discontinued the lessons not a single pirahã had learned to count up to ten or even to add 1  1
  sounds like a shit teacher tbqfhf
bump
  iirc theres african tribes that can only count to 2 after that everything is just many

why do people even care about climate change why should i care   muh children  i hate kids and never want to breed i see zero reason for myself personally to give a shit about climate change this applies for everything in the world too why should i give a shit about some kids being gassed in swedistan if its not me personally whyd i care    why dont i care but other people seem to is everyone just a fraud and pretending to care because they developed some social skill that i missed out on
  edgy bait  
  hehehe these puny normies
  lmao
  come back when youre not 13
  all i do is fap all day
  why should i care  the question is do you genuinely want to hear arguments from ethics and morality or do you just seek validation or fish for lulz   why dont i care  now thats a completely different question mostly rooted in psychology but when trying to rationalize it may appear as related to ethics or philosophy  unless you have good selfreflection skills     everyone struggles and feels pain physical or emotional everyone would appreciate help but if you struggle and dont get help you can think fuck it assholes i dont need you and this will gradually become your motto alternatively one can decide to help others as he has went through similar pain and can relate to it   empathy can also come from seeing someone close to you parents e g in pain similarly you can see how your parents struggled and nobody helped them and reciprocate by only living for yourself     the ability to understand the position the others are in be in their shoes improves as you use it you have to have good knowledge about the world to do it  you can never e g understand the terror of starvation if you never read/heard stories in detail or experienced it yourself same with different professions like miners or teachers with different disabilities etc     if you are a typical neet playing vidya and shitposting on 4chan it is unlikely you know enough about the world around yoy to truly understand the suffering or struggles of others  your post pretty much confirms it it it totally ok though as long as 1 you acknoyit 2 you are willing to improve     so one can either take the path of least resistance and say every man for himself like you did or stop for a second and reflect on your life and the life of others    it is ironic if op is sincere he likely cannot comprehend empathy and lives for himself because he did not get help when he needed it emostyle and now he in his turn will not help others and the cycle will continue
  all fine but ruining it for others makes you a massive faggot you dont wanna be a massive faggot
climate change is now its not longer 50 years away
1st of december  autumn has not yet appeared  trees are still green    shit is scary its like in no time we are seeing significant climate change crop failure imminent
  i care because in some years my country will be a desert and i will be alive when it happens if you dont live in an abused shithole like me you have no need to care
most of the disasters predicted by climate change are going to happen to impoverished countries that means waves of refugees 100 times the size of the ones we are seeing now dont expect border patrol to just take care of that either youre looking at a potential war here
  why do people even care about climate change why should i care    why did you make this thread    do you care about them caring about climate change
  based and redpilled
  lmaoing at your emotional intelligence quotient
bait for the bait god also you will want to breed when you get older not to mention the effects are already kicking in
  why not let them in theyll vote for social democracy anyway lol
  y its like  in our country the fucking trees blossomed again in autumn which never happens
  i can afford to pay the carbon tax it wont affect my lifestyle  ive got a better developed sense of empathy than you
  why should i care  theres a nonzero chance that things will fall to pieces before you die thats about it
i dont care about climate change for these reasons therefore you shouldnt care    really cringe also do you like being hungry because the breadbaskets of the world will be empty by 2030 we already have shortages of major crops
why dont we just sequence the genome of every living creature starting with the ones closet to extinction we might need to get a few of them just to cancel out any genetic defects and then boom who gives a fuck salt the earth and mcnuke the atmosphere in 50 years well just create them from nothing so they can dance for us in glass boxes
you are now given full access and authority at cern what do you do    is the entire facility a meme
  use it to gas jews and nonwhites
  based and redpilled
    throw the switch igor
  you are now given full access and authority at cern what do you do  if that means you are now in charge of the entire facility and own it  i would round up employee that works there and ask them all individually if they can differentiate the particles that are being accelerated and the electromagnetism that accelerates them each employee that answers the question will be terminated immediately each employee that cannot answer the question will retain their jobs with the company under new titles or be offered a golden parachute of some kind then the entire facility will be demolished and materials recycled or sold the proceeds going to a charity unanimously agreed upon by the remaining workers
        what is wrong with you people sounds like you all need to return to 
  answer the question
  human experimentation for sure
  what do you do  get them to publish the full spin analysis on the higgslike particle that they discovered in 2012 it is only a higgs if it has spin0 if it has spin1 then it conforms more closely to my own prediction than to higgs      up to training their replacements pic
  is the entire facility a meme  train their replacements unless this is meme cern running machinery that i dont give a fuck about
  these guys invented the internet you know are you this smart
  nah those were the guys that were there 40 years ago
  none of those posts contained questions
  basically let it do its thing for the course to 2030 and if nothing new is found in that time put finding toward a linear collider with roots approx 500gev
  that was us millitary project they invented world wide web also connecting computers was inevitable first to do that had optimal conditions it doesnt imply he was smartest
  you dont know what spinors are and what charge conjugation does  go learn that before trying to reinvent stuff
  have a tour then give it back to whoever ran it before because i have no idea how to run cern
shut it down and rescue the enslaved children
  what do you do  sell it
  i guess get promoted bc i already work there
  what are you looking for and through which channels
  do they need ic technicians ive always wanted to see cern
  you will have to chop off your dick they hate men there especially white ones they hinder strong women from finally adding something to physics
  i didnt know women wanted to be technicians at my facility they just get donothing engineer jobs and are glorified project managers while all the men do the actual engineering
  theyre clearing joking silly
  no talking chop it off already
  yes maam
  schizo
  are they still holding the data when will it be released so you can do the analysis yourself and end up not publishing because its spin 0
  use lhc to open a black hole and dustbin this gay earth
  n
  i
  g
      gonna take 3 while minutes to finish that word
  g
  e
  r
  a spinor obeys the spinor equation ie its transforms as a spinor charge conjugation is a matrix operation on the dirac vector youre fucking retarded and if youve been telling those lies in your reports then youre going to get defiled along the inhabitants of meme cern     go learn that before trying to reinvent stuff  learn the stuff from the 1920s before you fill in the gaps from the 1850s i bet you are real smart      shut it down and rescue the enslaved children  yeah maybe but maybe just nuke it after the slavers get defiled sadistically in front of everyone they sought to impress with their gay scientism      its not about holding data its about publishing the results of the only data analysis that matters how the histogram lines up against all not some allowed scattering amplitudes as yet if you look at the the published material they have not yet done the most simple and obvious analytical task im not saying they havent done it im saying they did it and decided not to publish it because it corroborate my prediction
  el arcon  youre fucking retarded  hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
  its not about holding data its about publishing the results of the only data analysis that matters  then fuckin do it yourself and publish it root and madgraph are free to download and use not that fuckin hard but youre retarded and incompetent so please stay away from any real data someone has taken
  not that fuckin hard  calculating the expected amplitudes of of the various channels in the lhc might not be that hard but it would be hard as fuck to invest that much time especially when i have no 1000 collaborators to point out the trivial errors i will certainly make doing it alone    also when i was working in icecube i used root it is poorly documented and very hard to use and if my advisor wasnt holding my hand on everything i did then none of it would have gotten done
  which is to say that would be very hard to do alone
  well im not sure what analysis you have in mind specifically but the 1000s of people do not work on the same projects the groups are usually fairly small ive known some people to do the analysis entirely on their own with help from advisor im sure the worlds greatest physicist could handle a single analysis if you dont like root thats fine dont use it i did all my work in fortran and plots in mathematica just get your shit done
  
  your shit  do you mean my theoretical work as opposed to using the software which is basically impossibly to use without an expert holding your hand through your first 500 hours before you answer dont forget my other superlative   historys most vindictive killer   that one is over all of history ive never claimed to be more than greatest physicist thats currently alive ask yourself am i really so sure he wont track me down later then even if you concede that i might ask yourself will he give me a merciful death the answer is no i might not track you down later but if i do it isnt going to be to give you mercy so with that in mind please inspire me to emote with your disrespectful tone
  greatest physicist currently alive  needs someone else to hold your hand while you operate a software package developed by someone else to do all the physics for you so you can skip the messy qft
  do they need ic technicians  dont know probably    what are you looking for and through which channels  our group works on designing strip detectors for atlas
  we did it reddit
  did you just reply to yourself
  greatest physicist  isnt a code monkey  wow
  not expecting you to code it expecting you to be able to use it for work and be able to interpret it but youre right youre the greatest physicist and shouldnt have to use computers go do the qft calculations that i know you dont understand enough to calculate by hand and see how long that takes maybe that would take the 1000s of collaborators to get done in a reasonable time
  youre the greatest physicist  the theoretical physicists job is not firstly to turn the crank the primary purpose of the theoretician is to make a better crank to turn
  neither of which is tooker capable of
  turning the crank in few cases aside from monte carlo algorithms is nothing more than writing a parameter file for a rungekutta algorithm i know how to dot hat pretty well while i only took one semester of real analysis and one of complex analysis i took the full two semester sequence of numerical analysis and my teacher was very smart and she was a woman
stop this waste of money and spend it on space travel
  its bad that i laughed at this
  like what shoot some particles through a body
  what do you do  upgrade it to peak power because i dont want to wait 20 years to get there for no reason run it constantly and continue to do so until i have more data than i could ever store  shut it down while we analyze data  repeat and beg for funding for version 2 that takes 100x more power
  come on they are just doing their job just ignore them like a would a beggar in the street
  expecting anything else on 4chan
  jizz into atlas    they do good work mostly but start getting into the sjw hype currently i hope they get out of it before everything is ruined
  cringe
  i even suggest learning to read first they rule out other fields with 98 confidence they do not rule out other fields on any premise other than statistics
  i suggest you learn to read there is a big difference between other models being ruled out at 98 and all of the models being ruled out at 98 my hypothesis is that the model they refuse to report on the spin1 model has not been ruled out at 98 but likely is highly favored over the spin0 models  the truth about geometric unity  
  turn on the particle accelerator   start making dark matter or some shit  whip out my dick  jack off into the particle accelerator  semen fuses with dark matter shit  create darkmatter anon  chill  it would be like shadow sonic
  not in 4channel
  kek wtf is this from
  collect antimatter to blow up vatican  as god intended
  they say the city of seven hills which is destroyed at the conclusion of the prophecy of the popes is actually rome how many hills are in jerusalem  
  you are now given full access and authority at cern what do you do  throw random things into the particle stream to see what happens then start a youtube channel
  the first thing i would do is make sure its shut off as much as it can be and then make someone give me a guided tour  then id start smashing particles and trying to administratively force the installation of viewing windows even if you cant even see it anyway
start hunting down the ibm 5100
  fpbp
  this is basically what theyre doing except intelligently so it doesnt cost an excessive amount of money for power during the high cost months the down time is planned and not wasted if you did how you stated your being wouldnt be funded
  they publish a paper and if you could actually show it maybe you could have a real paper that isnt just vixra trash
  wow you could make hundreds of cents from your youtube channel doing that and kill many people in the process such smart think
  walk inside the accelerator and turn it on to turn into dr manhattan or something
  hey i am watching it right now
last time he kinda dodged a bullet wonder how it will go now
hmm i wonder why he isnt posting anything on twitter right now
she publicly accused tyson of raping her in front of a live audience in 2010    i reaaaally think there was a better way to structure this sentence for an article  little uh misleading
specifically watson said tyson occasionally made misogynistic comments and that he kept a list of overweight actresses on his phone to prove that women arent inhibited by portrayals in the media when it comes to health and fitness he allegedly said it was untrue that women feel pressured to be skinny based on societal standards    this sounds like rape to me
believeallwomen
  another one bites the dust whos next
  was it autism
  this reads like its off the big bang theory sounds like him too
  why does he spend so much time thinking about whether sex can hurt somebody
  fuck i thought he was invulnerable
  finally this overrated pseud falls
  based tyson calling fatties out on their shit
  bbut muh universe defying thyroid problem
  my nigga got caught looking at brappers and came up with an autistic excuse
  i keep telling people metoo is singlehandedly going to result in society turning the clock back on female rights    it took you how long to come forward  you dont feel safe walking home alone at night  whatyou feel like a sex object wearing heels and wakeup    well better we just segregate men and women and ensure women look natural or covering uphead to toe to avert the male glaze
  if i post enough people will start to believe it  the worst part is that youre probably right
  god that bitch is like the only thick actressblack or white in hollywood
  believe wamen
      based
  hes infinitely more successful than you are stay butthurt
  such bullshit world we live in when such a completely unprovable claim can be enough to tarnish ones reputation  and so what if he did that he backed off when they told him no so wheres the harm he didnt rape them are men supposed to telepathically know when women are going to reject you fuck this shit
  allegedly made advances on here  wait i missed the memo since when is this not allowed how is a men ever allowed to show interest
  the claim is about something that happened 30 years so so even if this is not verboten it surely wasnt 30 years ago
  the claim is about something that happened 30 years ago  every time
  i can see the glow emanating from your butthurt from all across the atlantic
  member elevatorgate feminists tried to hijack atheism because a man asked a woman out for a drink
  elevatorgate  jesus christ i just read about this wtf
  a drink  not even an alcoholic drink at that just coffee
    to be fair this would be considered out of line in my country but in my country we dont approach strangers period i dont know whats happening in the us
  for the wrong reason
    this is what retarded white supremacists have to tell themselves to avoid acknowledging how worthless their lives are      its not only normal in the us its expected women will only date aggressive men and expect men to be bold and approach them then if a guy they arent interested in does it they cry about harassment  its a tricky world to navigate    yeah its pretty cringy it was the moment when i realized that feminism is a joke
have sexual tryst with a woman years ago  ends relationship on amicable terms  woman reads some bullshit on a blog about how that sexual encounter in college wasnt really consent  after some mental gymnastics she convinced herself that she was raped  accuse man 20 years later of raping her  listen and believe is now the standard response so the man is immediately tarred as a rapist  if the man tries to deny it people will just say that hes being an asshole for denying his guilt  anyone who says they will wait for evidence are tarred as rape apologists    is there any way to save your career/social life once you are accused
  fucking based
  no  just stop having relationships until you are over 30
  maybe they meant some stream
  damn this guys coming with fire
  the easiest thing to do is to remain extremely calm unlike kavanaugh make use of witnesses and people who will attest to your good character do not attack them but be firm in your adamant denial of the charges suggest that the person has misremembered what you had always assumed to have been a reciprocal and respectful encounter between two consenting adults abstain from alcohol around women who know your face name might be in similar social circles as you for a long time dont ever leave the semen inside them if you are worried about legit rape charges with that chick
    wtf i love black science man now
  what theyre doing using celebrities is what they plan for the rest of us its socially engineering and divide and conquer all the way and its a convenient framing device to destroy anyone who slips up and accidentally is human when the masculine and feminine are no longer able to unite and when were left afraid of each other theyll truly be able to do whatever they want to us    industry government the shadow government whoever what youre seeing right now is how societies are destroyed from the inside yes controlling the intersex dynamic can bring a country to its knees
  literally read that as   make use of whiteness and people will attest to your good character 
  i dont know why this made me laugh so hard i guess rape can be funny after all
i guess he wasnt joking when he said this
  does he not know about cats
  wait i missed the memo since when is this not allowed how is a men ever allowed to show interest  youre not supposed to fuck your coworkers especially people who work underneath you and rely on your good grace and recommendations to move forward in life    right wingers rightly crucified bill clinton for doing so despite the blowjob being consensual same deal here
the groping incident allegedly took place at an afterparty following the aas meeting in 2009 which took place in long beach  this was supposed to be a lighthearted social event to show that astronomers could have fun according to dr allers    tyson was there and he was dancing and drinking and all of that at the party  so a friend and i decided to get pictures with him she told me    but after the first picture was taken above left tyson decided to explore dr allers tattoo  it features a realistic solar system that stretches from her arm to her back and collar bone area    after we had taken the picture he noticed my tattoo and kind of grabbed me to look at it  and was really obsessed about whether i had pluto on this tattoo or not  and then he looked for pluto and followed the tattoo into my dress    lets be honest some of you austronomers would be distracted by the meme tattoo and also do this
  and thats you make faggotium
  tried to  they succeeded atheism is now firmly a hard left position any fedoras who werent commies went on to become poltards
  if she is not interested in you it is sexual harassment
  just stop having relationships  now how will i ever manage that
  still holds your body is just consuming less
  none of that shit will work the only thing that will work is to not acknowledge any of it and carry on you also need to have the sort of public presence that will let you get away with it    trump can get away with sexual harassment allegations because he is not afraid of controversy and him shittalking the media is nothing new somebody who has made extensive efforts to be pc and previously espoused listen and believe shit will just be seen as a hypocrite and walked all over
  i would not touch that ugly landwhale  bbut ur an incel  yeah and just because i cant get laid doesnt mean i cannot keep arbitrarily high standards
  blame twitter
    hes fat as shit himself what the hell is he on about
  there are more beauty spots on this body that there are stars in our entire solar system
  just because hes overweight doesnt mean he has to accept bullshit lies and excuses other people make for being overweight     personally i dont mind if people do unhealthy things because they enjoy them but people who make up lame excuses and double think to justify themselves can just fuck off
  i hope its not true
dont worry hell come back from this     on a side note did anyone read the new statistics behind rape they have proof that 2 in 1 women is raped
he will be ok black is higher on the oppression hierarchy than being female he also gets bonus points for not being christian in order to be taken down by metoo the woman would need to be muslim
  my mom is a nurse that worked for my dad and they have been happily married for 45 years with 4 children who says you arent supposed to do it if you find someone attractive you should show interest
  get meme tattoo with pluto placed on your tit for attention  someone makes a joke about pluto being on your tit  it was definitely rape
  tried to  it succeeded there isnt an atheism conference out there anymore with several women atheists or combating sexism in atheism panels
  tech conferences are the same way i dont bother attending anymore usually all of the presentations are online in a day or two and the networking aspect is dead due to the conferences being filled with activists looking for a scalp or two
  i think youre missing a word there fren  
  s
no one with a penis is safe men should all castrate themselves now
  what about women that have a penis
another high profile guy accused of sexual misconduct    i dont care at this point guess what men want to fuck women the only reason you construe it as sexual misconduct is because you dont like him it doesnt matter what he actually did the whole movement is a beta cleansing and a power grab
this only happens because u guys go after 6/10 women  go after 10/10s or bust
  feminists and gay people hate trannies its funny its currently a huge war in the lgbt community because everyone hates them
    he not making up lame ass excuses for being fat ass
  in terms of public opinion it depends on what side youre on politically and how much you expose yourself and your personal life when the allegations come down its easier to craft belivable fanfiction about a person who you know everything about and has conveniently left geotracking information available on their social media  in terms of an actual court you save yourself by not actually being a rapist and having enough money for retries in the event the other side is trying to hit you with a resource expenditure attack or you find yourself in a court with a judge or jury thats out for blood
  show off a tattoo your purposefully inked so that it goes up into your dress  smile and laugh as you show off tattoo to an inquisitive perspn  get upset when that persons eyes naturally follow the design to see where the rest of the tattoo goes after youve given them the green light to look at your tattoo
  reminds me of women who get huge tattoos in their cleavage and then get mad when men look at it
so if this catches on and reddit turns on him how many daily neil degrasse tyson dick sucking threads are we going to get
a man of very fine taste apparently
  just because i cant get laid doesnt mean i cannot keep arbitrarily high standards  based
  go to reddit
  hes married to a black woman no doubt he regrets settling when he did as he could do so much better now
  atheism is now firmly a hard left position  kek how fucking young are you atheism has always been left if anything it used to be more firmly left the conservative atheists on /pol/ are new they werent around back then most conservatives are biblefags who hate gays and want evolution taught in schools  and atheism wasnt about the left in general since 99 of atheists were already on the left it was specifically about feminism and it failed most atheists are too skeptical to believe something as obviously wrong as feminist theory plus iirc men are much more likely to be atheists
    shes got some serious milkers and a nice ass and she doesnt look that fat maybe a bit on the chubby side but not a landwhale you virgin
  his son is biracial i went to high school with him
    and i bet she feels heavenly to touch thats why he grabbed her arm the tattoo was just an excuse he could have looked at the tattoo without grabbing her
  having mentally impaired affirmative action hires like this in academia  tfw science used to be about the pursuit of truth
autism     shame i genuinely like the guy and his scientific outreach now hes going to get skewered by the left just for an accusation
  is there any way to save your career/social life once you are accused    tyson has more than enough fans to continue to profit through his podcast and speaking engagements  in tysons case his downfall will be his reliance on corporations like fox to provide him funding for his shows if he were to use crowdfunding enough people would fund either through kickstarter or patreon to allow him to produce cosmos should he be able to get the rights he can then offer it online and monetize through ad revenue as well as offering backers a bluray copy the show is special effects cheap cartoon and a few shots filmed on location hes the only actor that needs paid    very few will stop consuming his content based on allegations in his personal life corporations that provide the avenue for viewership will throw him under the bus because theyll be smeared if they dont  the safest way to proceed in the future for any person making anything that can be viewed as entertainment is to do it on your own tyson is too valuable of a team member for him to fire himself from his company thats why people like joe rogan havent been fired rogans company needs joe or else it cant survive
  by the left    its a rightwing false flag
  what happened to joe pull that up jaime rogan
  maybe this is why he was trying to push climate change hard recently im with you guys
  i hear they have barbed penises that ruin you for all the other cats
  she is a fridge
  wtf i love her now
i guess all the retards on the right side of this image now have another thing in common
  proof that hates women at least according to the typical twitter land whale feminist with multicolored hair and arms covered in kool tattoos
  i just want to repost this people arent taking this seriously or acknowledging how it fits in the bigger picture its about control
  shiiiieetttt    but we wuz scientists n shiet
  nothing dumb about the dawkins and krauss quotes and thats probably the least idiotic statement nye ever made out of context it could look like implications that philosophy has no value but youd have be clueless to think thats what they intended
  his son looks like he has autism ndt is married to a white woman but damn shes bottom of the barrel guess she was still an upgrade over whatever the black dating pool had to offer
    the reverse deniro
ndt    for a variety of reasons most justified some unjustified men accused of sexual impropriety in todays metoo climate are presumed to be guilty by the court of public opinion emotions bypass dueprocess people choose sides and the social media wars begin  in any claim evidence matters evidence always matters but what happens when its just one persons word against anothers and the stories dont agree thats when people tend to pass judgment on who is more credible than whom and thats when an impartial investigation can best serve the truth  and would have my full cooperation to do so  ive recently been publically accused of sexual misconduct these accusations have received a fair amount of press in the past fortyeight hours unaccompanied by my reactions in many cases its not the medias fault i declined comment on the grounds that serious accusations should not be adjudicated in the press but clearly i cannot continue to stay silent so below i offer my account of each accusation    and then he describes the incidents
  i want the modern trend of men wearing jeans any time anywhere to die
  they look like a perfectly happy family kinda unfortunate that their lives are now ruined become of some trivial bullshit
  a fuckin coalburner
    /thread
    not him but dont be jealous that they get more action than you
  post evidence
  why would anyone be jealous of anything in those photos the woman is a 3 and the kid has a mental disorder
  
  nah bro id rawdawg that hoe face down into the ground like a rodeo cowboy
  this post is why i claim incels do not exist men who do not have sex simply arent willing to lower their standards enough you are obviously not one of those men so at least youre getting laid even if it is by low quality slags
  or maybe its because climate change is real and only retarded science denialists like you say otherwise
  do you go outside by any chance she looks average for her age
  when i was in college i had a gf that i was very sexually active with one night we were having sex in the shower she was on all 4s and i was hunched over her hitting it from behind when she apparently slipped and sort of got pinned down in an uncomfortable position i didnt notice and she didnt say anything during the sex but she expressed annoyance right after i apologized for the next week she was very cold towards me and when i finally asked if she was upset about what happened she said it felt like i had assaulted her i apologized again profusely and we made up and continued dating for at least another year but i still worry about that whole thing coming back to haunt me in the future
  me too  he tried to make me measure his bbc with lasers for science
  hey wed be interested in hearing your story please email us at scoopshuffpostcom
    welcome to modern women  they live solely for attention and crying rape gets them lots of attention
  women can just accuse you of something and you have to deal with it  i sure do love modern society why did men give all of the fucking power to cunts
  betas anon same reason why there are fags who actively watch titty streamers on charturbate or twitch
  i never knew tyson was so based
him and richard dawkins are based and only hated by hipsters  dear muslima  stop whining will you yes yes i know you had your genitals mutilated with a razor blade and yawn dont tell me yet again i know you arent allowed to drive a car and you cant leave the house without a male relative and your husband is allowed to beat you and youll be stoned to death if you commit adultery but stop whining will you think of the suffering your poor american sisters have to put up with only this week i heard of one she calls herself skepchick and do you know what happened to her a man in a hotel elevator invited her back to his room for coffee i am not exaggerating he really did he invited her back to his room for coffee of course she said no and of course he didnt lay a finger on her but even so and you muslima think you have misogyny to complain about for goodness sake grow up or at least grow a thicker skin
  calling accomplished scientists retards because they are popular  sucks to be you faggot
  muslims have the right idea women should be enslaved
    t incels
yall have to go back 
  mfw i hate dawkins and hispters   checkmate straw men
  to study her bodywide tattoo of the solar system    theres a fat joke in there somewhere
  hating hipsters doesnt make you not a hipster
  this tbqh
  shut up you filthy whore
  fuck off back to 
  triggered
  based and redpilled
  daily reminder that many of the celebrities actresses and models are actually trans men    
  i think i see why youre not a virgin you can look at a 3/10 shapeless blob of fat and perceive enough milkers and ass to trigger an erection you also dont have any shame to be seen with a digusting creature like that in public
  daily reminder that the term hipster likely originates from the opium lounges where youd lay on your side hip and someone would pack a good ol bowl of poppies for you to smoke and zone away
  thats because youre a dumbfuck christcuck who sees everyone but conservatives as hard left i was fedora back in the days when dawkins and hitchens were touring the world trolling christians epic style and neither i nor most of my peers were commies the only thing we all had in common was that belief in magical creatures shouldnt be used as the basis of political worldviews    if anything most internet atheists back then werre libertarians which through the magic of onedimensional politics is considered right wing sjws drove many of them away and a sizeable chunk ended up on /pol/
   i missed the memo since when is this not allowed  women do not want to received advances form nonchads when women do not want to feel like sluts they can shame even chads from time to time
  wtf is wrong with women its so easy you can either say during  anon ease up im stuck  or after  anon yesterday you were too rough in the shower  why are women so bad at expressing themselves
  metoo   good thing this only affects men with money
  maybe they just try to be polite and not rock the boat  sometimes speaking up ruins the mood or causes a scene  its like they want the best of both worlds where they dont have to speak up and ruin the mood and also get to have their mind read
i understand that the vibrational therapeutic energy from planets bitch is straightup crazy but what the fuck do these other educated women stand to gain by joining in trying to destroy an influential black liberal    do they really want to establish a world where men date only by dating portals and use the pence rule everywhere
    do they really want to establish a world where men date only by dating portals and use the pence rule everywhere    maybe they do but the pence rule is bullshit and i unironically would rather go the trump route and just marry some foreign chick instead he might be a piece of shit but i at least agree with his mate option leaving those women to their own devices     the entire situation makes a mockery of both sides honestly i mean feeling violated over a handshake feeling assualted over having their galaxy tattoo inspected by an astrophysicist using a copy pasta rape allegation that happen decades ago and cant be substantiated seriously fuck off
  first sexist stephen william hawking next rape by lawrence krauss now rape by neil degrasse tyson  this is getting more and more ridiculous
  hes a celebrity he could have a teenage nerd queen instead of a used up old hag
  first sexist stephen william hawking next rape by lawrence krauss now rape by neil degrasse tyson    its the thot destruction of science  we need these men for science but its being taken down by metoo bullshit  see women destroy civilizations
  
i think its both hilarious and sad that people believe this shit they have absolutely way to prove
  like i was im not a cheater like what happened like  
/pol/ here i used to hate him getting shilled al over the internet but i really liked his statement funny as fuck to read about his secret pulse handshake etc  anyone got any info on what the fuck is actually going on did anyone find the blog of the nutter who accused him of rape
  stephen william hawking lawrence krauss neil degrasse tyson  add to that list walter lewin
  stephen hawking had lou gehrigs idk what he did but it cant be that bad this dude has literally been slowly dying his entire life
  dont you know poatoes are sexist because their starch content can induce stiffness
  he liked looking at large breasts in mens magazines most of his nurses were understanding of this but apparently one thought it was disgusting that he still had sexual desires so when whined to the press about it
  what is this
    comiccons are like that now too
  wrong women are weaponized to take down civilizations    what do you think the garden of eden story in genesis was about adam wasnt looking after his woman and paying attention to who she was getting on with so in his ignorance everything got goofed likewise men have been turned into drooling cattle that cant do anything but work drink buy toys watch their shows on the boob tube and ignore the problems of the world meanwhile their children and their wives are having their heads filled with all manner of twisted garbage and of course themselves as well and they just accept it accept it all    now im not saying women have no agency and need to be managed but speaking from a strictly male perspective part of the mans responsibility is to provide for and keep his family together and build meaningful bonds a key part of destroying cultures is rewriting or eliminating the family unit look around state controlled early child care nuclear family even is dissolved career women that dont even breast feed their kids and only have them because they sense theyre drying up    its a mess one of the biggest lies sold was that women can have it all they cant in our societal layout you cannot be a career woman and have children or a family and thats just the plain fact of it
  t neet/incel
  no just providing some thoughts on what were seeing right now
  o be fair this would be considered out of line in my country  iran      women will only date aggressive men and expect men to be bold and approach them  the strange thing is that wife beaters seem never to run out of wives to beat      is there any way to save your career/social life once you are accused  new identity and plastic operations
  he cheated on his wife with his nurse dont ask me how that dude was a boss though can still get balls deep when all you can move is your eye and your dick
  not just celebrities also ordinary men are targeted for payout from court people have started recording their encounters and one guy was cleared only because of him having recorded a date she later said was rape    the long term solution is of course to marry women from thailand
  just record everything like in deus ex like google glass or a body cam but less conspicuous
  men who do not have sex simply arent willing to lower their standards enough  this is why we have paper bags i guess
  maybe they just try to be polite and not rock the boat  the boat was rocked earth however was not rocked  sometimes speaking up ruins the mood  the mood was ruined  or causes a scene  since when did that stop women  its like they want the best of both worlds where they dont have to speak up and ruin the mood  this makes no sense whatsoever  and also get to have their mind read  it is their privilege to demand men read their mind when it suits them
  looks like a court transcript
  that fucking bitch hoe fuck women

we can fight against climate change and keep large scale industrial civilization  friendly reminder that if you believe this any degree youve gotten means nothing capitalism isnt the issue or the republican party or trump or the lack of green energy industrial civilization cannot exist with a stable planet prove me wrong    the embrace of nature to nurture the longterm growth of humanity and technology to prevent illogical deviations
  i think metroid and the scifi before it had it right the future and the sign of an advanced civilization is not looking like star trek its having mastered programmable self replicating machinery ie cells build a house build a bridge why grow the damn thing itll construct maintain and repair itself    there are two possibilities we end up with a near barren planet full of massive facilities and air shafts to maintain the atmosphere or we stop fighting the natural order and learn to harness it    unfortunately again we have east and west in ancient china you were spoken of building with nature or against nature which is why they had buildings without nails or pegs that lasted 10000 years and could be taken apart and put back together with the same materials every 100 years    man is doomed because its retarded
  modeling tech after nature  ive always been a fan of this humans are clever but nature is a system that has billions of years of trial and error to solve issues id put my money it rather than us some of the tech were seeing with selfrepairing materials looks promising
  its icky though
walk into car garden  take a trimming off the plant  grow my own 2087 honda civic
too late 3billions chink and pajeet gonna destroy the earth
  grow the damn thing itll construct maintain and repair itself  it will also be susceptible to illness mutations and unpredictable behavior
  if theres something making your house ill its probably making you ill which means youre goofing anyway    its a very different world to imagine
  industrial civilization cannot exist with a stable planet prove me wrong  assertion dismissed   
  prove me wrong  generation iv fission reactors
  not really different organisms have different susceptibilities   very different world  yeah i can imagine  a virus has wiped out all the bridges in the city  theres an autoimmune disorder in the subway system currently exterminating the passengers  an abnormal growth has damaged the electrical grid  the water supply infrastructure is dying and we dont know why  great headlines
  take all of those statements and apply them to humans fact it doesnt happen unless youve done something very wrong in such a world those things wouldnt happen they just wouldnt the scope and scale of contreol would be sufficiently wide that there would be not bad food there would be no pesticides herbicides fertilizers there might well be no mechanized farming at all    also in the case of an electrical grid it would be more of a network such a grid could self generate and load balance far more effectively than what we have now    either way there would exist some synthetic stuff
   virus has wiped out all the bridges in the city  the city government decided to take funding for infrastructure and give it to various nongovernment organizations of which the leading city government officials are members of in an effort to fight climate change    s an autoimmune disorder in the subway system currently exterminating the passengers  because foreigners commit rape on the subway late at night were going to take a stand by preventing men who are not part of that ethnic group but rather the one that has inhabited this country for over twothousand years from utilizing the subway during the day     abnormal growth has damaged the electrical grid  an antifa art house has niggerrigged a bypass into the electrical grid as part of their squatters rights     water supply infrastructure is dying and we dont know why  a certain political party notorious for directing infrastructure funding towards its members pockets has taken a bribe from a union to switch the water filtration systems journalists who align with said political parties interests are baffled
  he thinks you didnt prove x is the same as x is false  modern skeptics everyone
even darwin knew this was a problem with his theory take the human eye people say cells developed a sensitivity to light and benefited somehow to increase survival rates and voila  you get eyes but when we look at evolution in reverse we see how this makes no sense when you start with a complete human eye now try to regress this as an evolutionary process you cannot take away any of the necessary pieces nor can you take away 10 of all the pieces and still have a function eye at the point the 90 nonworking eye exists but not add any benefit to survival we see how ridiculous evolution is
this is the most plausible account ive seen yet        junk dna contains information about the environment and evolvability meta learning  distributed representations save the day    also your argument is stupid because genetic expression networks are not additive in the sense you are imagine it you do not take parts away rather you have a computation encoded in distributed representations that can tunnel to different phenotypes for the same reason neural networks can learn facial recognition function starting off of random weights its fucking magic but it works    now please fuck off with your evolution skepticism cheers
  ou cannot take away any of the necessary pieces nor can you take away 10 of all the pieces and still have a function eye at the point the 90 nonworking eye exists but not add any benefit to survival we see how ridiculous evolution is  youre wrong and you need to get  now because this fucking retarded argument has been dealt with for over 2 decades now if you arent curious about biology much less evo bio thats no ones problem but your own this isnt a board for debating ignorant niggers its a place for soontobe failures to pretend to know things about math and science you are not even at that impoverished level of worth or rank and should vacate as soon as possible
  evolution doesnt work by survival and reproduction but not dying until unit is reproduced
  yet reason tells me that if numerous gradations from a perfect and complex eye to one very imperfect and simple each grade being useful to its possessor can be shown to exist if further the eye does vary ever so slightly and the variations be inherited which is certainly the case and if any variation or modification in the organ be ever useful to an animal under changing conditions of life then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection though insuperable by our imagination can hardly be considered real
  ya know if youre gonna troll ya should at least used one of the less studied bits of evolution that theres still some debate over    eyes are pretty done
  random mutations and natural filters or natural selection our entire biology is random genetic noise given some sort of consistency by the natural filters of our world
  /pol/ said to post here but they make better arguments and counter arguments than /sci/ funny response though anon
  you quote mined darwin you fucking retard
    but wouldnt it be way more absurd if all the creatures in the world were just blind  of course the idea of some divine force creating eyes is also absurd  i mean out of these three options you have to think that eyes developing over a long period of time seems the least absurd
  its a place for soontobe failures to pretend to know things about math and science  fuck dude you didnt have to insult me so badly
could viruses or bacteria play a role    like crispr but over millions of years they actually manage to edit / copy over features like eyes across barriers    so eventually everything big enough managed to get some of the coding that creates eyes
  /pol/ said to post here but they make better arguments and counter arguments  i just saw a thread on /pol/ where someone tried to link earthquakes a geological phenomenon which happens daily to a jewish conspiracy if you think even for a second that anyone on /pol/ isnt either functionally retarded or trolling you have fallen so far into delusion there is no hope for you
why would eyes even come about
  unironically by accident if some organism develops a mutation that helps it to not die photosenstivity in this case it is more likely to live and reproduce than those who do not have that mutation
vision is such a boon to evolutionary success im surprised our vision isnt better than it is after 4 billion years

  well it cant exist so nothing
  mathsqrti212sqrt2neq 0/math
  do you have to use a modulus when applying pythagoras though    havent actually thought about that yet have any proof
  mind sharing it anon
  yes pythagoras says the square of the length of c is the sum of the squares of the lengths of a and b the square of the length of i is 1
  assume you dont have to  then there are triangles with side fucking zero nigga you wot
  lol
  yeah but this is maths  we can use the term imagine
  yeah but one of the sides is imaginary
  the length of any complex number is real
im not a mathematician but idk
  understand you are not looking at a triangle but a matrix of defined values
  what if that is not a triangle just two lines
  was gonna make a snarky comment about the old definition of minkowski metric with imaginary time but my imaginary time had run out
  no  the metric is positive definite you fucking retard
  you dont need a proof its part of the definition of mathmathbbr/math equipped with the euclidean metric
  what are imaginary numbers even used for in all my brainlet math classes up to calc 2 they were never used in any real world examples/exercises from my understanding its just like a 3rd axis on an x y graph
  electrical circuits with ac current
  calc usually doesnt cover complex numbers but they start showing up again in diffeqs they become a mainstay in engineering math after that
    makes sense with their flip floppyness thanks i never saw them again since i am a cslet
  this does not help sorry it doesnt work like that
  no the square of the length is 1 the length is i the square of i is 1 of course you cant assign i as a length so its just a joke
    shouldnt the longest side have a length of 1 
    this isnt really an application it is used as a trick ie representing things that way coincidentally happens to make calculations more convenient schrodinger equation is a better example but i am yet to find a satisfying answer as to whether its also just a trick there
  the op is saying length hypotenuse is sqrt 12  i2sqrt110 but 
  in graphics when youre using quaternions to rotate objects you get to use i
bump
  numbers are a trick though real or not
dist10i0iidist112
      these posts are cringy bc you all are wrong and obviously arent smarter than einstein
1i sticks out in the third dimension so from the 2d perspective it seems that the blue line has a length of 0
  youre all idiot except this guy    the hypotenuse is just lightlike the sides of length 1 and i are spacelike and timelike though which is which depends on the metric convention
  the metric has indefinite signature
        quantum mechanics was the first real world use of complex numbers    complex numbers in electrical engineering is just glorified trigonometry
  not if youre using the pythagorean theorem you fucking brainlet
  also any full metric must preserve the triangle inequality what op posted is not a triangle
  it gives us the fundamental theorem of algebra   if youre looking for applied like in engineering or whatever youre a brainlet
  mathi2  12/math  absolute goy    by using the actual application of the operation which is mathx  sqrtx2/math we get mathi  sqrti2  sqrt1  i/math  in fact it applies so flawlessly that even the sign of negative mathi/math is successfully removed mathi  sqrti2  sqrt1  i/math    but hey lets just make the absolute value of mathi/math equal to 1 because why not lmao xd
  v  11 v 
  mathsqrt2/math    but the length of vi 1 is 0
  what is modulus  what is zz    abuse of notation the magnitude of a complex number is the square root of itself times its complex conjugate its not absolute value anymore
    whats your iq
  this is the most brainlet thing ive seen all day
  zzconjugate  2
      seething
  i1
  i0
  i
  seething  yeah you can go back to 4chan  z obviously doesnt mean absolute value in this case you supreme retard i is in fact 1 and 1i is in fact sqrt2 kys
  ii
  no check out out length is defined
  lol its because i and 1 are orthogonal one lies on the real number line the other on the imaginary which means of course the hypotenuse wouldnt lie in mathmathbbr2/math
  yeah you can go back to 4chan  now im not a mod but id ban someone for life for saying this
  
  because the absolute value is defined as distance from zero you fucking retard
  why tho i thought i was being clever
  this is 4channel you racist bigots need to go back to 4chan so heroshima can earn moeny to hire a harem
  4channel elitism  i smiled when i read it
  remember it cant exist and keep walking
  there are no negative distances see the definition of any metric space
  the length of i is i  citation needed 
byampu
laugh in engineer and tell it to come back when drawn to scale
  math big boy here    im going to give a spoiler the definition of pythagorass theorem that would extend to complex lengths is    mathx sqrt z overlinez y overliney /math    i leave it to 4chan to prove why
  cringe
  or you could just use absolute values instead of flexing that you know what conjugates are lol retard
  it cant exist therefore there can be no answer
  rotate the triangle so that the only side you can see is the one of length 1 and it looks like a line now it makes sense
    this    you treat the yaxis as real numbers for the purpose of calculating the hypotenuse  you absolute brainlet
  sounds legit
  were using metric in two different sense here
  so ive seen this shitpost before and seen this  being linked in the thread  can someone whos not a brainlet and who can actually understand it explain it is it imaginary lengths being applied irl or something
  youre looking too deep into it the pythagorean theorem is concerned with lengths making ops hypothenuse be i2  12  12  12  1  1  2  ignore the uneducated trolls saying that i doesnt exist  even if you consider the sides of the triangle as vectors then the result is still 2 and not 0 im not sure why this image baits /sci/ so much
  wtf is up with 4chans latex
  mathdi1sqrtlangle i1 i1ranglesqrti1i1sqrt2/math
bümp
  looks fine
  i meant that on the picture the labelling implies that i is the length of that side as i said of course it isnt thats the meme the length of the side is the length of the vector from 00i to 01i which is 1
  abloo abloo complex lengths dont exist in reality  see 
  what does that have to do with length btw what a cringy article the editor all defensive/butthurt about imaginary meaning made up
  imagine providing a vector counter example to a solution entirely not about vectors
i wanna talk dimensions    what do you think of this
  good thred
the fifth dimension is consciousness necessary for the object to exist in space    calculations of dimensions are to tell where an object is all dimensions exist cohesively not seperately so this just breaks down or rather divides the dimensions the zeroth dimension nothing for something so exist nothing is the platform it is to exist on all that is a point nothing else to it    first dimension a line two points connecting distance has been created out of nothing    the second dimension the distinction of length and width direction and squares    third dimension depth volume and size not sure its purpose i guess this creates space its figurative form as much as its physical form    4th dimension time where before objects are measurable as x y with the added third dimension xyz length width and depth from the point to the line to where it is in depth still not sure purpose as x y were sufficient time measures when this is where you can see things as a whole while still keeping their identity time tells when it happened x y z 419pm 2018 as things progress it can now be in one point at one moment and be at another point at another moment as an object at xy z 419pm 2018 can be different from an object xyz 420pm 2018 time
  here i present that the fifth dimension is consciousness to observe where an object is in line with the theory that consciousness was created to observe the universe now    the 6th dimension is reality in order for an object to take up space it has to exist for it to exist something needs to declare its existence now i branch a bit and say that these things however cohesive have evolved over and due to the dimension time the power of circular time they exist then and always have as the dimension time has full domain over time in this dimension the 4th they always existed at some point  5th dimension consciousness observing the object 6th dimension reality the object existing here is a nice fit of the phrase which came first the chicken or the egg consciousness to observe reality or reality creating consciousness to observe itself with the power of time they existed simultaneously although it would be fun to think further if one had before the other    now i want to say im not too sure of the 7th dimension but i want to say it is where we lie now what we are able to interact with i want to say that the 7th dimension is the ability to traverse throughout dimensional space its here where one object could go from point to point
insert abstract concept here is an extra dimension    sure it is buddy
  now with the time dimension throughout time throughout an objects existence it may exist at different points in space here in the 8th dimension is where i submit the idea that this dimension is decision time consciousness reality 8 is decision space x time in conscious x reality bound by the laws of reality and which if true are bound by the laws of consciousness as consciousness is bound by the laws of reality an organism being apart of that physical reality here one its individual dimension every decision whether gravity and the laws of reality making a decision on where a rock will be from 419pm and at 420pm to where you will be you being the collective consciousness to bring it down to earth it is why you can connect with other living things we live in the 7th dimension which i believe is how we perceive things in 35 dimensions all of the 3rd dimension and part of the 4th dimension not all of it as you would be able to see where you would be in space throughout all your time or rather your collective being in space which the eighth dimension governs the why    9 outcome factor x factor the 9th dimension is the outcome of two objects meeting in space time dimension 6 is where its attributes are given and i would say 5th is where that holds any meaning 9 being what happens when those two dimensions interact 9 could be what allows the dimensions to interact 9 being an ingredient for things to interact and influence each other so they can move along in each respective dimension    the 10th dimension being the sum 9th dimension being factor x factor the 10th dimension is factor x factor   it is all the of the above all dimensions exist cohesively not separately this just breaks them down
it makes no sense we cant speak of dimensions existing outside of counsioisness if this is physics
  this isnt /x/
  the fifth dimension is consciousness  lol retard
  dimensions  1st a flat horizontal plane in space  2nd a vertical plane in space  3rd specific defined points in 3 dimensional space the first two dimensions combined  4th flat vertical plane in time  5th horizontal plane in time  6th specific defined points in 3 dimensional time  7th spacetime all previous dimensions combined  so what comes next
  correct up until the fifth and fourth dimension then you started espousing metaphysical bullshit while time can be interpereted using 4th or 5th dimensionap mathematics even as a form of compression to quickly manifest information from it to say it is a strictly 4th dimensional carrier of information is to look at a ball that changes size and say it is 4th dimensional when it is in fact always 3d the same goes for conciousness
  4th dimension time  wrong the fourth dimension is spacial just like the other 3 the fourth dimension is like taking a box putting it in the exact same place and being able to move between these boxes
  
  good post
  ok the 4th dimension being spatial as well the boxes being then on a different plane but still on the graph i can see that now whats the fifth it
it even adds an extra layer of depth a place you can only reach by going on that plane but as well still residing on the other dimensions as well
  dimensions   a flat horizontal plane in space   a vertical plane in space   specific defined points in 3 dimensional space the first two dimensions combined   flat vertical plane in time   horizontal plane in time   specific defined points in 3 dimensional time   spacetime all previous dimensions combined  so what comes next    my guess would be   8th a flat horizontal plane in quantum space  9th a flat vertical plane in quantum space  10th quantum space combined  11th quantum space time in which all 10 dimensions are combined  because of how different quantum space appears to work than regular space time
    thinking more on it i believe it should be    dimensions  1st a flat horizontal plane in space  2nd a vertical plane in space  3rd specific defined points in 3 dimensional space the first two dimensions combined  4th a flat horizontal plane in time  5th a flat vertical plane in time  6th specific defined points in 3 dimensional time  7th spacetime all previous dimensions combined  8th a flat horizontal plane in quantum space  9th a flat vertical plane in quantum space  10th quantum space combined  11th a flat horizontal plane in quantum time  12th a flat vertical plane in quantum time  13th specific defined points in quantum time  14th quantum space time in which all 13 dimensions are combined    because of how different quantum space appears to work than regular space time
  no
  ok the 4th dimension being spatial as well  yes theres no logical explanation for jumping from time to space back and forth    the boxes being then on a different plane but still on the graph  i did a pretty shitty explanation on that so heres another one look at a door or a window close to you and imagine a world where that door or window was just a wall switch between these two worlds of where the window/door exists and where it doesnt and you have yourself a 4d house    i can see that now whats the fifth it  the fifth dimension is pretty much impossible to figure out because we barely know what the fourth dimension looks like and even if we did it figure out what it looked like it would be impossible to describe it in any way    also sorry for the late reply

  white women can never compete
suppose that
the proof is trivial
  proof is trivial and left as an excercise
for this example we will be considering the special case
  consider a scenario in which  crawwwlling iiin myy skiiin
  thats what you get you dumb math nerds while you guys are dredging through faggy problems that nobody cares about im making a 6 figure salary with plenty of prestige and job satisfaction as an engineer
let
  waking up at 430 am to mingle with joe long johns and record pressure readings in the rain and mud    yup you won
why
fuck
  wake up at 7am  breakfast prepared by my wife  leave for work at 730  get back home at 1230  go back at 2pm  finally return home at 7pm  wifes awaiting me    neets should be gunned down
  put  put    do you think this is a game this was is math not a lego fabrication company do you take me for an engineer am i seriously supposed to just put the very sacred very abstract numbers into the equation and hope it works out where are the proofs where are the axioms somebody tell me somebody please tell me aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
think
suppose the proposition is false

race realists btfo
op confirmed retarded
    normal distributions
  i mean thats like race realism 101  everyone understands that  the probability that a race realist is familiar with normal distributions is way way higher than for the general population
  lol i remember this its so easiky debunked because nigeria has a population of 191 million compared to germanys 82 million
nice false flag
  derdoktorant was one of kraut and teas academics and is completely serious about that
ive never taken a stats course and even i know youre fucking retarded op
  thats not debunking its just explaining why his claim is correct
and what did niggeria accomplished  nothing  and today  and they are way more
  can nigeria be stopped
  that is exactly what race realists are saying though  dutch people are usually taller than anglos but some anglos are obviously taller than some dutch people
even if you isolated all of the above 99 iq nigerians and then put them all into their own isolated country their kids would have a smaller average iq since the non additive genetic effects which made them above 99 in the first place would be reset since non additive is just the science way of saying luck regression to the mean exists
  incorrect  its explaining why he doesnt understand statistics and normal distribution
i just realized i misread the infograph a 180m population only has 30m over 99iq what is wrong with them
  please no pet
when are we going to admit that 100 iq is basically retarded no matter what race you are
  when are we going to admit that 100 iq is basically retarded no matter what race you are  this is the true redpill the burden of 130 iq man has gone unnoticed by all
  nigeria pop 191m   30m over 99 means 161m under 99  84 of people score 99  16 score 99  germany pop 82m  41m below 99 means 50 score 99  50 score 99
    so the original tweet was correct there really are 41 million germans with iq  100 and there really are 30 million nigerians with iq  100 thats why i said you arent debunking him because what he said is correct    hes selectively drawing attention to statistics that he thinks race realists would not accept  in the attached chart hes choosing to focus on the cells i highlighted  arguably the numbers for iq 115 and 130 also included in the chart are a lot more important
  but lets say you pick a higher threshhold say 115  am i correct in speculating that the next generation would regress some distance toward the original mean of 85 but would have a good chance of still having a genetic iq 100  and then the next generation wouldnt regress any further and you might have the basis for a successful modern black country
  so i see you are trying to prove the tweet wrong as well
  thinking that outliers matter compared to averages  implying those germans are not just trks  implying any iq under 120 is even worth calling human  poor show op
why not just create a third normal distribution with variable d being d  nigeria  germany and calculate pd0 id do it myself but i cant find the sd for this data anywhere unless its 15 for every country and im just a brainlet
  am i correct in speculating that the next generation would regress some distance toward the original mean of 85 but would have a good chance of still having a genetic iq 100  yes    and then the next generation wouldnt regress any further and you might have the basis for a successful modern black country  yeah but iq isnt the end all be all and no blacks would ever try to make a country like that since the ones that are smart know theyd still have it better in white mans land
  when you cherry pick one of the highest iq african populations in existence they just come out below white average really makes me think
  hmm
  his statement is true the implication is false
  who is derdoktorant and why does their opinion matter
  thats not the point in the image the average /pol/fag race realist doesnt understand how the bellcurve even works they think every nonwhite is low iq so we should kill them and form a white ethnostate in america ive even seen /pol/fags unironically argue that chimpanzees and gorillas have higher iqs than blacks     this pic debunks their claim there are 30 million nigerians with an iq above 100
  even if you isolated all of the above 99 iq nigerians and then put them all into their own isolated country their kids would have a smaller average iq    no they wouldnt the thing dragging down nigerias average iq score is the lower class people with poor nutrition education etc europe and asia had similar avg iq scores 100 years ago when the average person was poor as africa develops we will see their average iq raise just like europe and asians its the flynn effect
  good argument for merit based immigration system
anyone know where i can download the metric version of shigleys mechanical engineering design
google shigleys mechanical engineering design metric version pdf
so say the icecaps did fully melt i understand that many coastal areas would be wiped out but wouldnt there be a large area of land opened up arctic/antarctica at the same time     how much land roughly would be opened up by this happening and how much would be under the ocean would there be a net gain or loss of accessible land     accessible land basically means to me anything you could stand on id figure this out if i could but im just a fucking brainlet    also this isnt a climate change or global warming thread just a simple question from a simple mind please take that argument elsewhere    if you respond to this thread thank you for giving a fuck
  you can already stand on most of antarctica what do you think all those penguins are doing    but if you dont count icecovered land as land then it could be a net gain it depends on a few factors were not totally sure of yet antarctica will rise slightly without all the ice on it
all humans are just globs of carbon atom chains that have gained a conscious awareness of surroundings existing only to replicate itself love is only the electricity in our brain that gives us the urge to reproduce the only reason we want a long life is natural instinct to survive and death is just the passing of matter into different compounds sooner or later that matter may be consumed by some other life form religion is a human construct in which we try to make since of the unexplained for we have higher intelligence than the other life forms on this earth our curiosity has reached to more complex horizons trying to find meaning for we fear the unknown none of us have a purpose or a meaning both of which are also human constructs we are only a chemical reaction created billions of years ago only to exorb energy to evolve into something more complex though the reason the universe even exists at all is too much for us to comprehend we can only say that it exists for the lols    what is your view on the matter of existence anons
  it is never too late to accept jeebus cripes as your lord and savior he will give your life meaning
  what is your view on the matter of existence anons  all humans are just globs of carbon atom chains that have gained a conscious awareness of surroundings existing only to replicate itself love is only the electricity in our brain that gives us the urge to reproduce the only reason we want a long life is natural instinct to survive and death is just the passing of matter into different compounds sooner or later that matter may be consumed by some other life form religion is a human construct in which we try to make since of the unexplained for we have higher intelligence than the other life forms on this earth our curiosity has reached to more complex horizons trying to find meaning for we fear the unknown none of us have a purpose or a meaning both of which are also human constructs we are only a chemical reaction created billions of years ago only to absorb energy to evolve into something more complex
  amen brotha
  i am only asking your view of the universe and why things are the way they are and if there is anything you have to disagree with me
  i left out your last sentence for a reason
  i personally believe we are not yet advanced enough to comprehend the reason for existence i just want to hear other peoples probably more educated opinion on the grand scheme of things though i doubt i can find an answer
reason  error 404 not found    there isnt a reason the planets formed because space rocks collided no grand reason just physics    the big bang happened because of what ever causes big bangs no grand theory just physics we dont know about yet maybe never will
  exactly why the fuck is there even a big bang why isnt there idk nothing at alleven though lack of existence is impossible to imagine
  by reason i mean the cause of why everything is even happening to begin with
  you are here to create  it is the highest form of intelligence  as above so below
  love isnt the electricity its the circuit
  why isnt there idk nothing at all even though lack of existence is impossible to imagine  because eternity exists beyond time and space you are right nothing is impossible    potential realised triangles could exist so they did clouds could exist so they did because it could and it did  maybe consciousness is the ultimate answer
  reason is something that intelligent minds use to make decisions there is no reason to think that there is an ultimate reason behind the universe since intelligence and reason are a product of the universe not the other way around
  love is only   i have to disagree historically ive had the same hardcore reductionist nihilistic perspective but now in my mid twenties im beginning to realize that its a myopic and incomplete picture i mean think about it it has to be false constructivism is just reductionism that implicitly locks to a given scale as far as im concerned but likewise you cannot allow yourself to forget that when reasoning else you come to foolish conclusions    in the most general case things cannot just magically display certain behaviors nor can they magically be drawn to each other they require a means a given machine must have a certain manner of operation and a certain range of states and patterns of energy transfer to be able to identify another system and either be consistently drawn to it couple and synchronize with it to a degree and take care of it with particular interest an object requires a means to do this and the range of ways to solve the problem is not large and is certainly not infinite    therefore you can say theres such a thing as love energy and so forth
  i personally believe we are not yet advanced enough to comprehend the reason for existence  thats not what you said though
  i mean think about it it has to be false  no it doesnt  in the most general case things cannot just magically display certain behaviors nor can they magically be drawn to each other they require a means a given machine must have a certain manner of operation and a certain range of states and patterns of energy transfer to be able to identify another system and either be consistently drawn to it couple and synchronize with it to a degree and take care of it with particular interest an object requires a means to do this and the range of ways to solve the problem is not large and is certainly not infinite  yeah and that was explained in the portion you cut out of the quote  love is only the electricity in our brain that gives us the urge to reproduce  you can look through other forms of life best examples in other animals to see similar and different solutions to this problem  there are animals that mate for life animals that exhibit similar behaviors to humans if their mate dies or leaves them but also animals that dont form long term relationships that dont have relationships beyond the act of courtship and mating  all these animals have been successful so it is clear there is nothing magical about our case its not unique its not perfect its just part of the evolutionary path our predecessors traveled on
  i think it wasnt really understood what im saying im talking about low level mechanical means for a given system to display a certain core range of behaviors yes love has a number of manifestations and ways it will play out long term but im speaking specifically of how you get logic such that a machine will perform certain behaviors within a sufficiently broad range of contexts    we can also expand this to the macro objects that will be keyed to selectively read aspects of another objects state and amplify it as necessary example the us and russia during the cold war a single set of bulbs emitting light would be in an instant transduced amplified in multiple stages and through multiple different pathways possibly ending in the launch of multiple warheads a massive amplification of a very minute signal and rapid state change throughout a system how do you get a machine that so specifically watches and responds to another specific system there arent many solutions you cant just do it it needs a means the us and russia were coupled at that time with similar mechanisms    nah its real interesting and this kind of energy is present at all scales and at all levels of organization you could have a bag of magnets that display love energy
  the answer to your question is evolution and the mechanism is hormones    you could have a bag of magnets that display love energy  id like to see you try
  yet if you abstract to the most general case and watch the pattern of state changes type of organization or pattern of energy transfer youll likely see similar trends across many kinds of systems from animals with faps to man to computers    id like to see you try  so would i
  well yeah macro is driven by micro  again that doesnt make love unique in any way
  we exist so god can exist god exists so we can exist bada bing bada bong the loop of meaning has been solved
  go home descartes youre drunk
  from animals with faps  i see im not the only one excited for destroy dick december
  you make it sound like ddd hasnt already begun
  any month  destroying youre dick  ishygddt
  my views match yours op normies cant accept that though they think they exist for a reason have a mission in life are made to do great things
gonna remove myb deep/infected ingrown toenail by myself with a scalpel and tweezers will lidocaine topical cream  turnicate  ice bath bring the pain down from a 12/10 to about a 4 im a real pussy
ill probably drink about 500ml 80 proof liquor too just to be safe
what kind of chemical do they use to kill the root bed
  why are you doing this
    holy shit    i thought they injected the lidocaine to make the whole toe numb  idk anon you shouldnt do it  youre gonna bleed like a stuck pig from the alcohol and probably fuck it up even worse
  just go to your doctor you benis   and learn how to cut your toenails properly so this doesnt keep happening
alright /sci/ lets talk about time how can we properly describe time either mathematically or physically we know time isnt static variable as it is always changing time also isnt discrete as all of the attempts to create a chronon or time quanta failed so can we then assume that time is a continuous variable we also can safely say that time isnt a wave cause we never observe the consequences of its wave nature and thered need to be a medium for this wave the general consensus now is that time is one of the axes of a four dimensional spacetime but how accurate is it its just a model after all and there could be a better one is time even a physical phenomenon or is it an abstraction that we ourselves created in our mind in order to help us keep track of things if so how can we ever prove or disprove that
i personally was thinking about connection between time and energy the only reason we can keep track of time is because we can observe the change in energy that happens in that time period like keeping track of the clocks arrow this has the potential to be connected with entropy as time only occurs with energy transfer and as such increase in entropy although that would imply that at max entropy when all energy is equally distributed through space there would be no time as there would be no energy change to observe as such i want to ask everyone a question how realistic would it be to describe time as a 4d vector field we could assume that time is the wdirectional component of vector which shows energy transfer in 4 dimensional spacetime to me that makes sense these vector components would always be colinear to one another and their magnitude could potentially be changing with the presence of energy since mass bends time and energy is equivalent to mass would such a model work could time be a flux of 4d vector field
face it science is nothing but a way of coping with the truth that life is inherently suffering science is an optimistic way of life that boldly claims life is logical life can be understood the truth is that life is suffering and contradiction and what is real is knowable only through wisdom not through logic and reason
  get back to your containment boards you luddite
  life is inherently suffering  maybe if you read the work of the person you posted youd know why thats wrong
  life is inherently suffering  suffering is ultimately just caused by chemical reactions in your brain if neuroscience gets advanced enough to the point where we can completely reverse engineer the brain we could theoretically redesign our brains to not suffer at all and experience nonstop euphoria
  i want to be a mouse that nonstop taps the pleasure center of the brain
  and what is real is knowable only through wisdom not through logic and reason    enlighten us
  life is suffering  suffering maketh the man
  science is a way of escaping suffering not through silly things like creature comforts or life extension but through indefinite progress the progress has an ultimate end and this end is finally escaping suffering not here and now or even soon but certainly at its logical conclusion which could be millennia or longer from now
  based and redpilled
  but why would nonstop euphoria be a good thing wouldnt you want to suffer in certain situations i cant imagine feeling amazing after a death of a loved one
  wisdom without logic and reason rofl   if life is irrational then the most irrational action is to be rational and thereby live  suck my long reason
  suffering is caused by chemicals  but what is suffering
  irrationality  meaninglessness  careful anon your assumptions are showing
  when you drop your last chicken nugget
  starman
  if life is irrational  makes argument based on rationality  try again
  idiot we know life is suffering logic is a multiplier of suffering we go through it so that life seems light by comparison this is the way of the west  bahahahahahahahahahaha
i think you are mistaking it with religion religion a way of finding optimistic meaning in our worthless lifes science keeps it real which makes it so great proves how we are just a spec of dust in a blue marble and that the universe doesnt give a shit about any problems we have our lifes and you can look at science in a pessimistic way or optimistic thats up to people
  what does it help you the need to be sad  death is a beautiful and natural part of life lose and why we feel sad when we lose something we love is completely egotistical and sits on the same reward system that punishes kids when they lose a game  the negative emotions are not constructive   the truth is life is absurd we cant objectively define a goal as good by looking only at our own psychological biases and maybe we cannot objectively define a good goal in general
  i love how much nietzsche has been misrepresented by pop culture because it has become a good way to weed out the retards that think they know about philosphy
  i somewhat agree  but we are on no short supply of those who read nietzche and only nietzche
picture this  its 2035  gene editting has almost been perfected  people can effectively design their babies  can choose traits like intelligence looks etc    would it be morally irreprehensible to have babies the natural way given that the alternative is 1000x better
if im one of the last ugly dumb people on earth im visiting avicii
  why do people always insist on those three features honestly i personally would imagine a future where there is far more variety to the human gene just think about it what about blue eccentric happy disorganized people with two antennae in their heads and square eyes i want that kind of future d
  you sound like you post on orions arm
  i would still hope there are some people who dont design there babies so if something goes wrong we have backups
  if hes 8ft she must be 4 shes wearing heels
  no people should repordice however they want though those with the ability will go for crispr babies unless they have spiritual or feelings reasons and thats ok
    christians will probably find a way to be offended by it and will ban it in their communities
genetics have nothing to do with intelligence or the perception of good looks    thea idea of genetically modifying children aside from being monstrously immoral and unethical is also doomed to failure
  we would never make people 8ft tall its a waste  i dont get how a board of supposed stem people dont realize that the optimization is towards the lower bound in terms of size  everyone will be like 4 and a half feet tall 5ft most man and woman if anything women will be larger than men on average as fecundity is directly related to size/height whereas men do not need to be large at all  but either way lmao at thinking big people have any place in the future sorry to rain on your parade though
  one chance at life  born after gene edited babies
  optimization   for sex traits  say hello to peacocks for me
  peacocks get steamrolled all the time  something like 65 of males are killed during mating season because theyre so easy to spot and they cant fight for shit  not optimized at all you want a look at true optimization in sex traits look at angler fish something like that is the direction humans will go although less pronounced  a state that attempts to increase aesthetics at the expense of utility will not be able to compete with those that go for utility maximized intelligence minimized mass higher military output higher economic output higher scientific output minimized resource usage for maximum resource efficiency  there is no place in the future for these obsolete aesthetics that i see people on this board post about all the time
      optimization for sex traits will be entirely pointless when artificial wombs make reproducing with women obsolete
    the relationship between a man and woman will not be obsolete so long as we have sex drives and an urge to bridge the gap of seperation of our ego to the world around us      your ideal of sex traits being obsolete in the future is a illusion and a way to cope with your current situation
  the seething manlet typing this post
  why would you do that and bottleneck reproduction     sex drives can be manipulated as well   explain why any state would render itself non competitive in this fashion    im far too large to be considered optimized a little under 6 and like 190 pounds  think about this logically i thought you people were supposed to be in stem i guess i was wrong
   and an urge to bridge the gap of seperation of our ego to the world around us    unless you can replicated the dynamics of a manwoman you will not be able to make them obsolete
  sex drives can be manipulated as well  not to mention its mostly socially constructed your problem isnt actually a problem
  genetics have nothing to do with intelligence   so do you think that chimps for instance are just as innately intelligent as humans and if chimps started being raised as humans you would suddenly start having scientists philosophers doctors lawyers etc who are chimps  or the perception of good looks  if this were true physical appearance would be essentially random if genes had nothing to do with looks children would probably have zero physical resemblance to their parents  thea idea of genetically modifying children aside from being monstrously immoral and unethical is also doomed to failure  its doomed to failure in humans even though its been done successfully on crops livestock pets and various other animals
  not to mention its mostly socially constructed your problem isnt actually a problem  t psychology and philosophy brainlet
  a proof of your idiocy is that of suicide rates of japan and the ideal having mindless sex has never fulfilled anybody of substance thus its a desire which goes deeper than sex drive
2050  be one of the kids whose parents didnt want to gene edit their kids  everyone is 65 chad with 200 iq meanwhile youre 58  tours over boyo
  t neuroscience psychology and computer science brainlet  all evidence agrees with me     japans problems are completely cultural     58 is far too large to be considered optimized let alone 65
  is this a real post or sarcasm its hard to tell because sometimes people on /sci/ are legitimately retarded but either way this post is comical
  would it be morally irreprehensible to have babies the natural way given that the alternative is 1000x better  yes gene tech should only have the childs benefit as its criteria best genetically possible health and intelligence for the child as those are the objective values everything else changes in time beauty is in the eye of the beholder but intelligence and health is not
  this manlet still whining about optimization  manlets when will they ever learn nobody cares about some worthless health benefits that will already be covered by other modifications being taller just looks better and is more desired universally every parent when being asked how tall they want their child to be will prefer tall rather than short     like lets say there was some gene that had some minor health benefit but it made you have ugly green splotches all over your skin and a gross growth come out of your forehead nobody would want that shit it makes you look like a disgusting freak being a manlet is the same thing nobody cares if theres some tiny benefit if the price is being a manlet
  its not minor its significant for the same amount of resources you could sustain a much larger population while having superior military economic and scientific output no intelligent person or state would want to render their nation noncompetitive or if you really would youre irrelevant and your opinion doesnt matter  also it doesnt just look better thats completely socially constructed if you are actually a stem dude youd understand function over form every time there is no benefit for what you want   this is evolution
  these guys really are pathetic  they arent even right  in the end it doesnt even matter because reality is what it is and they cant fight against true optimization
  do you think hating art and aesthetics is a sign of intelligence do you think a truly wise and utopian society everybody would live in plain grey cubes and eat nutritionally balanced bland sustenance cubes for every meal when humanity trades beauty for efficiency you have a dystopia     im sure our 500 iq genetic gods will be able to cope just fine making scientific advances while eating as much vatgrown synthetic cow meat as they want
              attraction to size is socially constructed/cultural the society of minimized people would find that to be attractive while also having superior military economic and scientific output   i dont think hating art and aestethics is a sign of intelligence my claim is size is neither aesthetic nor is it efficient and as such it will be rendered obsolete and removed from states that care about remaining competitive  the future ubermensch is a gnome not a giant
  are you implying that there are parents who wouldnt want their child to be a tall smart chad     keep in mind that baby designs arent going to made by some computer optimization spreadsheet for pumping out the best wageslave theyre going to be designed by their parents with traits their parents want
  i agree that height attraction is socially created however you are missing one key point the people who will decide what the future children look like are alive now and have the current social conditioning they will not create children based on what ancient chinese would want they will not design children based on what 200 ad native americans would want they will design based on what society right now wants
i know this is racist and i dont care but caucasian facial bone structure is objectively the best bone structure and the only one that makes it even possible for a person to be facially attractive i hope the chinks recognize that keep the slant eyes and black hair if you really want that doesnt even bother me but please get rid of the pan faces and flat noses that arr rook same  /racist rant
    why would any state allow its citizens to be inefficient and render itself less competitive  parents will get limited choice over the traits unless the society cares libertarianism over utilitarianism so much that it doesnt care about its future  i can see something like the west doing what youre talking about and then losing to the east which would focusing on function   i do not want that for my people or their future
  also if every person has the intelligence of einstein the human race will almost certainly never cease to be there is no moral reason not to do it
  theyll definitely delete the double eye lid as soon as possible its one of the most common cosmetic surgeries in the world
  hes got a point their is a reason why human height has had a stabilizing selection versus seletive selection tall people got btfo and their tall genes ended with them selecting for tallness is just as arbitrary as selecting for pretty feathers in peacocks    tall smart chad  dumb white cracker societies that choose form in the sense of tall people will get btfo by societies that choose function in more efficient shorter people these tall fucks are so inefficient they have to eat so much more resources greedy mofos tall people are not environmentally sustainable plus all the waste in medical resources because of back problems and other height related diseases selfish white crackers are going to get btfo
    t manlets  you guys are just 510 midgets that are projecting right     rather than feeling bitter about your condition you should just be happy that soon no children will have to suffer like you have when theyre all born as real 6 foot men
    do you think it would be possible to use this technology to get rid of niggers like create a virus which sterilises them or something
  we dont need to get rid of niggers if we just use genetic engineering to remove all the qualities that make niggers undesirable   niggers are violent make them less violent niggers are dumb everybody is a super genius now   there problem solved
  if you dont study science or math dont post here
    hmmmm i see your point if we could fix niggers there wouldnt be a problem anymore
  i notice that you still havent posted your height very interesting
  exactly optimum human height is around 5 feet no downsides many upsides especially as we will be living longer
  and your cracker society of 6 foot lanklets will get btfo by a society of 3 foot dwarves a spaceship built for awkward 8 foot lanklets will get btfo by the more efficient compact and higher manned dwarf spaceship youll have a situation where 8 foot lanklets battle against antmen like in the movie with augmented strength and speed suits and will get btfo because they cant even see them in the first place
have an old white trash lady coworker  one of her white trash daughters got pregnant half a year ago  at age 18 with no education or job  by a truck driver  coworker tells us about how they had gone to the hospital because the baby was too still  doctors asked them to stop smoking  ask coworker if they had been smoking while she has been pregnant  well yeah but now were not smoking anymore  indoors  my soul when  baby growing tanks and background checks if you want to be a parent when
  i already posted my height and weight     again it makes no difference im also not a 200iq super genius but im not talking about not making everyone super geniuses thats an actual beneficial trait large size is a negative trait optimization to the lower bound is beneficial  why would you care either way your aesthetic can go both ways but function can only go one way so you choose the function that is more efficient and then model the form after it
  you are confusing sexual selection with environmental fitness  sexual selection is driven by the irrational impulses of society   environmental fitness is what you would want to aim for if you want a true super being
  brave new world wasnt supposed to be a documentary
tfw was born a few decades before genetic engineering  tfw when youre going to witness it but wont be a part of it  thats not fair bros
what are long range promotors enchacers modifyers silencers single nucleotide polymorphisms     genetics is complex and would take more than 20 years to get right
  under the current meta perhaps however if you can edit life itself you can literally create mermaids by editing in gills   thus land people will have a disadvantage in water    every advantage you give them can be a disadvantage somewhere where the environment is wrong or different   thus the solution is to max min all their stats
  relatively beauty and fitness are in the eyes of the beholder  objectively according to god no  according to the state yes    its goona happen anyways the rich and powerful must ensure a strong legacy   or they will get a nation or personal army full of young and strong soldiers     while we have mapped the genome we are still far off from determining all the fuctions that genes hold but since there seems to be a silver lining on certain genetic defects and certain evoluationary advantages read sickle cell and malaria resistance i think itll be more of a balancing act than maximizing traits   like sure we can make your boy intelligentbut how much vulnerability to panic do you want your kid to have too
  can choose traits like intelligence looks etc  intelligence  if parents think they can just alter genes to make their kid smart theyre going to be in for a big surprise when they realize their own parenting style and the kids environment have a lot more to do with it than just changing their dna
  2035    lol kid you know how people thought wed have flying cars by the year 2000 and you think well just be able to choose intelligence like its no different from picking blonde hair and you want to debate the moral consequences of this kind of decision    is there even a single person here who has a biology degree

  something being a social construct doesnt mean it doesnt have material impact or that you can just wish it away or that its invalid just look at money arguably any form of classifcation like biological taxonomy is socially constructed as even if you have a collection of traits how those traits are clustered and bordered are constructed yet we dont reject it because for the most part its useful your gnomelet child might physically be healthier but living a few years longer wont mean much if theyre socially ostracized the fact is being tall is desireable and saying its a construct is meaningless
  no its immoral to not give your child the best way possible
  sexual selection is a way to optimize for environmental fitness the human environment is a social one thus people are optimized for social desired traits like height and those who are selected for such as height there is nothing irrational about this being a manlet is only if youre planning to be a solitary feral out in the wild digging burrows and hunting oppossums
  conspicuously keep making the exact same thread with the same wording and abuse of emotionally charged imagery  oh yeah guys well have perfect gene exiting on less than 20 years  haha wouldnt you be like a smelly peasant retard sinner if you didnt take out a second mortgage asap to make your kids better zog goblins  you do care about your kids and not being a smelly peasant normal human right anon  i cant quite figure it out we used to have a word for this before electionfags existed it escapes me now
  polygenetic traits might not be fully controllable but key genes in them can ie mice were grown with human like myelin sheath and they were more intelligent improving things like sheath quality could certainly increase human intelligence
  give source or fake and gay
  8 feet is ridiculous anon at that height all sorts of stuff goes wrong with your abdomen
  it does not follow that gene editting will necessarily enable selection of physical traits we are still quite far from being able to figure out which genes control for phenotype we cant even figure out how the beak shapes of darwins finches are encoded genetically
      it was actually astrocytes not myelin injected into the mice still smarter though
  found it        it doesnt really seem to indicate this would boost human intelligence other than fixing cog deficits from demyelination very interesting but more an advance in antineurodegenerative medicine and less an advance in cog performance enhancement would need to see substative proof of at least boosting primate intelligence and then some application for improved glial cells in humans along the lines of these murine and primate trials
  why would you do that   to avoid having to deal with women and the agony of childbirth  and bottleneck reproduction  why would artificial wombs create a genetic bottleneck
  gills on a mammal is not viable water has very little dissolved oxygen in it compared to what you need you would need a very low metabolism for it to work better to have expanded lung capacity and better oxygen storage in blood cells
  if theres one thing oa gets right its that human civilization will only become more varied and fractured as time goes on
  picture this  its 2275  everyone died from cancer and the human race is extinct
  really people talk about ethical review and legislation and all things like that for year but then now we just need one professor and all the system in place are failed not even a rogue professor but a professor that is affiliated with a university conducting the event at a proper hospital and also keep contact with western world professors yet the world still doesnt know until allegedly the baby get born what is going to stop some actually rogue scientist from serving those with ill intent
  i absolutely guarantee that no matter what the consensus of moralists around the world is all the worlds major super powers will be secretly researching and practicing human genetic modification china is absolutely going to keep doing it and russia and the us arent just going to let them have this tech for themselves     at least if its out in the open us normies can at least know about the results and economic forces will eventually make it affordable for us instead of just being used to make super soldiers
  at least if its out in the open us normies can at least know about the results  how can you tell even this particular case might not get follow through because of complexity surrounding the situation    actually i suspect the ethical review isnt even that big of a reason here if the scientist is actually one of chinas target in their thousand people program to lure into china to help the chinese technological development then china have every reason to suppress every news about the incident to prevent anything like that reaching trumps ear as it would also count as intellectual theft one of the core concern in the trade war chinese government have already told its media the program cannot be reported anymore however the news write themselves  just imagine what trump is gonna think/say if he saw this on fox tv right before he head to meet xi
  on the contrary    i think christians will endorse it in a few years time like they endorse medicine now and modern tech     only a matter of time before the first/second genetically made jesus
meat bags will still be inferior to full body replacement cyborgs with ai augmented brains
  you have no idea how biology works do you
  maybe maybe not
regardless of all this manlettaca talk what do you all think of the crispy kids lala and nunu and whether they should be allowed to reproduce
  sure but we really need to take a look at the medical papers though
increase melanosome production    first thing id do to my kid
  such genetic mmodificatin would probably decrease the rate of cancer
  you are severely misunderstanding what i was saying  the entire nation will be gnomes and there will be no large men the nations of gnomes will completely out compete and dominate the ones with giants and the states will not allow their people to make their children large
  sexual selection is a way to optimize for environmental fitness  an imperfect way it can be cheated faked and deceived women evolved to have larger butts not because fat butts have any evolutionary advantage but because it tricks the male into thinking she has wider hips than she actually does which is the environmental fitness he was actually looking for similarly men prefer women with less body hair and crotch hair because those women are generally younger to counteract that mature women simply had to shave     so enhancing these superficial traits just because modern people find them attractive will not give us any longterm evolutionary advantages
  yeah thats tough one to swallow
  born after gene editing  parents were drunk when they designed you and made you 56
  engineers  genius level intellect  this is bait right
  would it be morally irreprehensible to have babies the natural way given that the alternative is 1000x better  yes
  seething manlet
  parents forget to uncheck gyno box before completing their order
  super powers will be real
  ah ive seen gattaca too good movie
  how do you plan on banging the chicks then     i reckon that blue chicks with antennae would look awful as fuck
  sorry dude but optimization doesnt care about your memes  large people have no place in the future im not optimized myself but i dont take offense to it i dont get why some people itt are getting offended by it
how do i get a job in china researching crispr do i need a biology phd
  super powers
who /horatio/ here
  will not be obsolete so long as we have sex drives  it took me about 2 years to start masturbating to trap assholes it wouldnt take me long to start fucking them
  it isnt 100bc it doesnt matter if roman manlets btfo giant gauls
  taller people are more successful height and aesthetics clearly impact human psychology and happiness by your assessment our biological imperative should be to create something like cubicle humans with genius intellects that are placed into 5x5 or smaller chambers hooked to reward center stimulation devices or genetically manipulate the limbic system to maximize productivity like some sort of hedonistic borg society    ill stick to my comfy villages supercities and aesthetically pleasing super humans personally
  taller people are more successful height and aesthetics clearly impact human psychology and happiness  only in societies where height is socialized to be a beauty norm just like certain hair colors or skin colors these are not evidence of innateness if you study stem you should know what constitutes actual evidence of causation vs just correlation  also youre not countering my argument about the objective benefits my people will also have comfy villages super cities and aesthetically pleasing super humans ill just have more of them for cheaper and in all ways outcompete yours  this is evolution
superior genetics
  height is just a meme it is currently a status marker because in the past rich people were taller
   after gene edited babies    your robowife does not care what you look like
  youll get a lot of perfect designer chicks wanting to do you just for the kinkiness fucking a rare exotic slob youve got a bright future anon
  delete this image anon im already suffering
  maybe we can figure something out with consciousness or souls next
  but when everybody or at least a significant amount of people does it wont they all be the same  people thought the internet would create an age of humans who would surpass their predecessors due to the free information  but we all became more retarded
  the sad part is we dont need robo wifes for this to happen they exist in the real world but are so fucking rare after the (((sexual revolution))) fuck kikes and fuck you
  what kind of shit taste do you have
  how affordable is the technology will health insurance cover it
  they said the same thing about vitamin c too
  tselfish brainlet
  how affordable is the technology   not that much a middleclass westerner could affort it  will health insurance cover it  only if you can convince politics to do so
  would it be morally irreprehensible to have babies the natural way given that the alternative is 1000x better    yes anything else is just empty pseudomoralistic bs i would be fucking pissed off if i knew my parents could genetically perfect me and choose not to do it
ive said this before and i will again   if the first majorly crisprd generation comes of age when were all elderly they will euthanize us
  why would it be reprehensible attaining better genetics is the singular goal of all life on earth
  how are people ignoring these trips
  im on your side but what are better genetics
  bigger more aesthetic cocks
  why should they kill their own parents people who were genetically modificated for increased health and intelligence dont differ fundamentally from those who werent modified
  even for the girls
    i remember asking my micro professor about intelligence he said that genetics do play a role in someones intelligence but not nearly as much as one would think humans in regards to genetic intellect are incredibly similar so ones intelligence is far far more dependent on nurture rather than nature
  yeah thats why niggers have an average iq of 100 fucking retards spreading nurture over nature arent naturally smart enough to know how stupid they sound
  well no consider the environment most of those inner city people grow up with they arent fed properly at a young age and most arent raised in an environment that values education and thought genetics does have a role but id argue its 1020 nature and rest being nurture
  not a /pol/tard btw my position is that intelligence is genetic to a large degree
  nature makes around 7080 who we are  
changing a few couple of genes in some specific pattern sounds way too easy of a solution specially if were taking about biology   i surely wont be living by the time designer babies will be a thing but i dont see a bright future for said technologies for the general public or even the elite any form of eugenics being actively applied will be frown upon no matter class religion or race
if its not affordable its essentially paid evolution and evolution has always been selective to a degree
   morally irreprehensible  more than bad grammar
  you want us to turn into andorians
  perfecting gene editing isnt easy think about animals there is a reason we dont have live stock that is immune to all diseases and grows perfect meat super fast hell we dont even know how to do it with plants really well and plants gene editing is a magnitude easier than animals
  being 8 feet tall would lead to a pretty short life i do think it would be wrong to make someone so much taller or so much shorter than average height like that
  its the same thing today with the rift between europeans/asians and africans people are different populations are different    the difference is that technology allows us to bridge the divide and take control of of our differences and our fates    yet people are seriously arguing that inequality is better left to chance and historiogeographic happenstance rather than to human ingenuity and good will that any future where we try to reign in our flaws and improve our health and abilities will inevitably become dystopian or even is innately undesirable these pessimistic luddites are the scum of the earth doing real harm and stealing our future
  if its easily available and confirmed to be 1000x better then yes
  because crispr is about what genetic makeup your children will have and were you sane you would never saddle them with future problems better then to go for safer and clearly beneficial traits
gene editing has been perfected   2035       lol shows the arrogance of man 20000 genes the deletion/editing of one could end up with unintended results that may not even be apparent until years down the line
  all evidence agrees with me  first off you never mentioned any  secondly you never explained how things would work out in prehistory when it was more about nature and very little about culture
can someone tell me whats currently holding back biotech and edited babies is it the cost is it the computational power like do we need more data     im currently trying to figure out what to major in and ive been wondering if it would be better to do something like major in bioinformatics
  if you cant figure this out inuitively you shouldnt pursue a degree in a stemfield ask broad question of yourself what could go wrong what would be difficult to manipulate what dont we know what would be difficult to know what might we overlook and where can we begin to reveal some of what weve been missing
  yes genetic warfare has been studied for decades it is more low key than nuclear weapons and has far greater damage potential      we most likely it would have to be voluntary      if you are 2 m tall you will have difficulties fitting into a battle tank or a fighter aircraft      that makes the wild assumption that cancer has not been defeated in 250 years      all the worlds major super powers will be secretly researching and practicing human genetic modification  most likely many nations have already started
  morally irreprehensible  you lost me here
  when we analyze hunter gatherer societies and other more advanced but nonwestern societies there is no male taller norm and women do not care about height at all                  these societies are hunter gatherer and as such are evidence of how things worked during that period in human history and have tens of of thousands of members far more than necessary to draw statistical conclusion  height is a socialized beauty norm  from there all the other things i outlined objective superiority in military capability economic output scientific output and quantity of population for the same amount of resources points to the obvious conclusion  there is no place for large people in the future or more accurately nations/states that makes people big will lose to those that make people small i talk about making women bigger only because fecundity is directly related to female size shorter women have more risk and as such they should be placed in the range where they dont have these risks but are still optimized to the lower bound      so we will create a society of small men and women where the women are bigger relative to the men but both are as small as possible  i do not understand how a board full of supposed scientists and mathematicians do not understand everything ive written about so far why do you guys care at all are you really that irrationally angry that the gnome master race is the future
  some one never heard of argyria
  monstrously immoral and unethical   are you trying to be cute
  offtarget mutations and editing large segments of the genome are the main challenges with crispr so far its only reliable for single nucleotide edits another issue is a lack of knowledge of how genes influence phenotype the first problem with crispr is mostly an issue with molecular biology the second issue has multiple approaches but is currently being addressed with gwas and big data ie bionformatics however these will only ever identify correlations and we need to verify that the snps identified are causal their specific mechanism of action and how they interact with other snps this again is a molecular biology challenge and to me seems immensely challenging basically bioinformatics will help us find the needle in the haystack so to speak but we need to figure out how the needle actually works before we do anything
  not true  met a dating consultant she declared me a no chancer not wanted on her register would be like those unshiftable wrecks junking up the lot of a second hand car sale  only chance is a thai woman with poor eyesight
  the west is doing everything it can to cater to its weakest membersand imported members in a broken morality anything viewed as being superior is problematic due to the hierarchies of power the religious are opposition to scientific advancement as well because of biblical passages like blessed are the meek for theirs is the kingdom of heaven    crispr is the the moral thing to do but convincing a fractured society to pursue it will be tough china doesnt give a fuck and will surpass the west    consider this the us got stomped in the olympics and made performance enhancing drugs in sports illegal
  im pretty sure if we start pressing all the buttons the picture will reveal itself in no time
  china doesnt give a fuck and will surpass the west  except they put a halt to the research too what gives
  imagine having the worlds sexiest baby
  a little under 6  under 6  oh no no no  hahahahahahahaha
  i do not understand how a board full of supposed scientists and mathematicians   oh my sweet summer child  do not understand everything ive written about so far  we understand its just you insist on ignoring the obvious reality that calorie consumption is not a limiting factor for a society advanced enough to practice widespread genetic alteration nor is caloric efficeincy or population size ever going to give one nation any meaningful advantage over another in the modern world  like others have told you the current year is not 200 ad  look at the united states  literally paying people not to farm overconsuming calories low population density  global hegemon  obviously geographical and intellectual resources matter far more than caloric and this will only become more apparent in the furture as humans are replaced in war and industry by automation  the most successful nation will be the one with the best automation and that will be designed by the best brains and a bigger brain which needs a bigger body to support it will always be able to do more than a smaller one  see pic related for the ideal make body you may not like it but this is what peak performance looks like  why do you guys care at all are you really that irrationally angry  why do you care at all are you really that irrationally angry about being 510 king of manlets
  we understand its just you insist on ignoring the obvious reality that calorie consumption is not a limiting factor for a society advanced enough to practice widespread genetic alteration nor is caloric efficiency or population size ever going to give one nation any meaningful advantage over another in the modern world  except that it would be the second most relevant change you can make other than just increasing average intelligence an increase of intelligence mixed with minimizing size will be the two most important modifications that we can make to the human race  why do you care at all are you really that irrationally angry about being 510 king of manlets  no because its irrelevant to what im saying the reality is as ive said and all you can say is bbut people dont want that as a counter its irrelevant   large size is not optimal in any environment it being the modern era doesnt matter because were comparing the size relative to other sizes two super geniuses for the price of one will always be better no matter what in any environment even if you include automation or any other tech even if you can still support the one large one thats the point  no state is going to sacrifice quality and quantity of their citizenry just because women might get mad at the prospect of being the larger sex its irrelevant compared to the benefits gained
    so optimal and aesthetic such a real man
  yes
  drunk dads make you look like a randomly generated midget oblivion character  being born before designer babies might be a blessing
  you need to read more fanfics and remember that the shape of water is a thing like a lot of women have weird kinks and probably would go for that shit    i think this is probably untenable as an idea for a lot of guys because theyve been rejected by women in the past and with this in mind it can amount to i would rather fuck a blue eccentric happy disorganized person with two antennae in their head and square eyes than you or something like that
  no unless youre stupid or fat both are correlated anyway
  you clearly have no background in biology and dont deserve a right to speak its possible to make a effective trait through gmos already chinese gene edited babies we cloned a goat cured silvia of that weird immunodisorder ethics caught up and stopped them from continuing im living in the age of retardants that think theyre helping the world by being dogs
  does anyone remember reading studies that show gene editing only holds for a few generations even in gen 1 there is a massive loss of the edited genes im on the bus and to last to search for them it was something about fruit flys  is above is true gene editing in humans seems only a short term meme technology
  thats why you edit every embyro
  i remember the study now essentially the fruit flys dna referred back to a pre modified state each generation including gen 0 deleted dna was restored and included ones dropped  editing every embryo will not even garentee your first batch will all have the edit
  post the study then doesnt really make sense seeing as weve already directly edited crops already with no reversion to the original genotype
  watch the movie gattaca 1997      muh nigga
  but when everybody or at least a significant amount of people does it wont they all be the same  the point is absolute goodness not goodness relative to others  people thought the internet would create an age of humans who would surpass their predecessors due to the free information  but we all became more retarded  no we didnt thats a reactionary stance with no backing that only gains traction among altright virgins
  large size is not optimal in any environment  evolution disagrees   bigger brains are better and one nation can have as many monsterbrained giants as another can have peabrained midgets because humans are not made of rare elements you can have as many as you want of any shape or size  the deciding factor is who has the best technological resources and those will be acquired by the biggest brains who can compute and create on a level minibrains can never aspire
  reported family income btw my hypothesis is that black people like to flex notice that it my hypothesis is more likely than the black people are dumb hypothesis because mine doesnt have literal mountains of evidence refuting it
  you wont need larger brains with strong ai smoothbrain
  this also almost all personality traits iq conscientiousness the gay gene are extremely heterogeneous  they will probably have postnatal enhancements that directly affect the phenotype before they figure out how to edit all the genes that code for it  what this will potentially be used for is congenital diseases that can be traced back to one gene ie cystic fibrosis
  (((the white masterrace)))  1 in 20 is a carrier for cystic fibrosis
  did someone invent a way to get strong ai sweetie      genetic engineering is already here and imaginary transistorbased intelligences cannot compare to the creativity and consciousness that already exist in the flesh that we merely have to enhance soon biology will pave the way to a future of transendent thoughts the like of which your minibrain cannot conceive and a megabrained humanity will spread its seed of life across the very stars
i never got iq tested but for a long time like many others i was obsessed with it  i now realise something crucial  successful people dont worry about iq because theyve already achieved what they can achieve  then its only unsuccessful ones that bite their nails wondering if theyre capable or not    the answer is surprisingly simple  if i am intelligent then iq has no play into success and then i should disregard it as a banal distraction  if i am not intelligent then i have to disregard iq for its not able to change drastically and i could put my effort in something that suits me better such as wageslaving and buying manga and watching anime and eating snacks with the money i retain    why must one care about academic achievement and iq surely only materialists do so and anyone intelligent shouldve already subscribed to stoicism and abandoned the material    thoughts why not wageslave/neet
  also i meant cynicism instead of stoicism althought stoicism is also relevant in this discussion  dont dismiss me to /his/ please
  t iqlet    you are basically trying to goku your way out of powerlevels i will be straight up with you and say the only reason ive gone so gungho into ths whole iq thimg is because i think i have cracked the base theory for multiverse portals and i will need people whove measured themselves to avoid unnecessary casualties for the experiment   o
  iq  stopped reading there iq is to /sci/ what dick size and height are to /fit/ what huwhiteness is to /pol/ i cant believe a thread died for this
  thats what i am arguing you fucking nigger
  to be fair iq is what str is to fit and what int is to dungeons  dragons
  tfw 200 iq is a nat 20  tfw iq is diviseable by 10 to get int scores
  iq is irrelevant  creates thread with list of inane questions about iq  pick one wilhelm
    simulation theory  real    pick one
  youre wrong im right  please give me approval
  if i am intelligent then iq has no play into success and then i should disregard it as a banal distraction  if you are intelligent then youre iq is high youre doing some sort of weird circular jew shit here
  you are basically trying to goku your way out of powerlevels  cant i just raise my iq powerlevel with meditation and shit
  being proud of anything usually means youre lacking in something else or at least you feel that way    i dont think ive ever felt like bragging unless i felt inferior    for example back when i didnt use to go out and do things with girls id feel the need to constantly mention the few things ive ever done now that ive got a more active life i dont feel the need as often kinda the opposite    generally the more content you are with yourself the less will you feel vulnerable enough to have to assert and justify yourself with anything    yes i used to also be proud of my iq
  that ups your wis int is upped and learned by hardcore study    
  lol
    how smart can you possibly be if you had to pay someone to tell you what your iq is
  haha thats what i think too
  iq matters for career and quality of life at the upper and lower bounds
  and yet its the best predictor of success that we humans have
  but not the only predictor
  successful people dont worry about iq because theyve already achieved what they can achieve  they wont worry because they always have high iqs
  iq matters but people who know they have high iqs end up being egotistical assholes low iq hardworking fucks end up being more succesful in many cases
  this
  no but its the best
  dont repeat yourself
  caring about your iq is the quintessential thing of a low iq person    i wouldnt want to know my iq and if you do it would probably be better for you if you didnt
  you dont need iq to be successful because the most successful people in the world got that way exploiting the high iq and technical knowhow of those under them which only requires passable intelligence but also raw unadulterated social dominance and influence skills  you dont need to have a high iq to be a valuable highpaid wageslave either you just need some technical skill thats in demand  i see iq mostly as a measure of learning ability and cognitive potential even having a high one wont directly translate into an accomplished career and having a lower one than others in your field just means you need to work harder which certainly doesnt preclude success if youre passionate about it
  why not wageslave/neet  try it and see how long you can keep up with dealing with taking orders from normies who you couldnt possibly relate to and hate you for making them feel stupid alternatively have fun trying to justify sitting on your assistance playing videogames all day try justifying doing fuck all with yourself to whatever romantic interest you have
  according to you anonymous 4channel poster who thinks being neet is acceptable
normalfags hate smart people normalfags see us as the danger to them normalfags constitute a majority of population they are genociding us people with 140 iq by making us neets and using us as their slaves we the intellectual people should rise and fight the fucking normies to arms
  right after race that is
  be low iq  get good education   am now high iq  cant explain that
  what i ment by that race is 2nd best determinator of sucess after iq because race and iq are coarelated
  id say effort is the best determiner of success but theres no metric for that
  you dont smart at all
geoff hintons advisor told him this when he started his phd always trust your instincts when pursuing research if youre smart your instincts will lead you to good research if youre dumb it doesnt matter anyway
hi high iq polymath musical genius here iq isnt a big deal and there is indeed a strong correlation between ethnicity and iq not because intelligence is linked to iq but because the test are primarily written by white academics your iq more than anything is a measure of your aptitude taking an iq test and once an individual has seen once such test they score higher on other tests what this means is that iq tests have a strong pro insider cultural bias    iq isnt a big deal focus on actual achievment
not because intelligence is linked to ethnicity
what was the starting point which eventually lead to this universe being created has there ever been a time when absolutely nothing has existed
  why do you have to share weird shit
    without consciousness nothing exists literally
  what is this from

who know
a friend told me that distillation towers are chemistrys equivalent of 3d printers is there any truth to this we were talking about general purpose manufacturing equipment does that sort of thing exist in chemistry
your friend is dumb crystal growth would be closer to 3d printing
    is there a machine that does that
  3d printers dont blow up
chemical vapor deposition has far more in common with 3d printing
  separation equivalent to creation of 3d model that is quite close to schizophrenia

this is op btw
what is the point on the number line where the neighborhood of zero becomes the neighborhood of infinity like which actual number is it that splits it up is it like way over 10100 is it 10100000 what is it
  there is none
  neighborhood fuck off with that imprecise shit
    die detractors
at least keep the shitposting contained in the existing thread
  please do not question the word of our lord and master el arcon
  a neighborhood is by definition a set or interval    you can make a neighborhood whatever you want    example the neighborhood of the origin is 11    your proof will never work without giving exact numbers even if you do the proof still wont work because it relies on ambiguity youd be better off with a constructive proof by showing that numbers below a certain value dont matter

  theres already a ndt thread up why do autistics obsess over this man so much
  wtf i love him now
  after we had taken the picture he noticed my tattoo and kind of grabbed me to look at it and was really obsessed about whether i had pluto on this tattoo or not and then he looked for pluto and followed the tattoo into my dress    wow what a rapist
  lel sounds more like extreme autism which we all know he has
    kek this
  sadly ill bet he was actually looking for the pluto tattoo
i came here from pol cuz your shitass mods moved one of these threads here    do you guys like eugenics might open up a general now that i know this board exists    thanks jannies
    an accusation from nothing
  a lot of us have migrated here to spread natsoc among these soiboi cucks  together we will make this board more based and redpilled

  yeah
what is the advantage gained from preheating an oven
the oven doesnt instantly heat up to the temperature that you set you have to wait for it
  sure but why use the preheat setting instead of the setting youre planning on using
air doesnt conduct heat very well so it takes a while before the oven becomes hot enough if recipes didnt ask you to preheat it they wouldnt be able to estimate cooking time properly and some foods need specific temperatures
  oh wait you mean like the preheat on a toaster oven no idea the setting probably has the oven get as hot as possible so it preheats in the least time but professional ovens usually dont have a preheat setting because like you say its pointless probably a marketing gimmick to sell to dumb normalfags
  optimized
  
  theres a preheat setting on mine i just set it to the temperature and wait for the little red light to turn off

thoughts on ketamine vs ativan vs geodon for excited delirium    ketamine is king imo
  talk therapy
  haldol is real king    also you shouldnt be giving benzos to a delirium that is not alcohol or bezos induced you know what could potentially happen anon
  haldol  you need to kys
  bezos induced delirium
  haldol is for icu use primarily shits too expensive also im more worrier about respiratory depression then benzo induced delirium lmao
   wat is a delorum kek      he can induce delirium tho imagine he cancels all the dolls you ordered from amazon instant delirium
  this is what muskrats suffer from
  in what shit undeveloped country are you from mate no haldol for real is this bait     respiratory depression then benzo induced delirium  what im not talking about benzo induced delirium im talking about benzos paradoxical reaction you do know that delirium is of biological nature right you need to fix what is causing it and you shouldnt be giving shit that could further decompensate the patient you find the cause if too excited you try verbal deescalation if not then you think about low dosage of drugs like fucking haldol or benzos but benzos only if it is alcohol or benzos induced delirium you are trying to help the guy not fucking kill him
you poor medical lads know a good accurate resource i could use to recreationally study biological processes on my own
  dont think so    psychs use benzos and intensivists use haloperidol here not sure whos right didnt even know ketamine had such properties    you gotta give a pretty hefty amount of benzos to accomplish respiratory depression anon
  do not give ketamine to a patient on delirium unless you want to make your life way worst  i think this anon is confusing hyperactive delirium with psychomotor agitation syndrome

hi guys im lost new here on 4chan i wanna know the nearest route to the best meme farm in town can someone please help i need juicy memes thank you amen
  just pirate textbooks
  yeah i mean k is actually know to cause psychiatric symptoms    lold
im not a littman fanboi or anything but who the hell thought of these and why do people actually buy them like i tried a colleagues pair and you cant hear shit the two hoses rub together all the time and theyre uncomfy as fuck
  idk i have one of the cheapest chink y ones and they work flawlessly  one tube from each ear connect to a single tube
study for a histology test  cant remember tissue names while taking the test  holy shit lads i cant believe my memory is so shit how do you cope with a shitty memory while in med school its not like im failing but having shitty scores while some of my colleagues get straight as drives me fucking nuts
    depends on your age if you are over 50 i would certainly do a colonoscopy to r/o malignancy at minimum a dre is required to diagnose this condition     go see a doctor
    just pirate harrisons internal medicine     depends on the field really    for example the book for emergency medicine seems to be rosen     if you wanna learn like a med student look up ufap for first two years then look up step 2 prep for the next two years nothing can replace the clerkship experience tho 
how long has it been there do you have any other medical illnesses in the past    see a doctor
  a long time dont remember  i did not have any illnesses    a friend of mine that is a doctor told me ir could be an infection he gave a lotion that have corticolsteroids antibiotics or somenthing like that  the only simpton i have had is and itch that appears occasionally and disappears in a couple of days along with the redness
in all the medicine exams if you write something thats bad theyll cut marks for it right
is it possible to grow out of asthma im 21 but it makes me incredibly depressed that i have it  i never get really bad attacks but its pretty common for my lungs to start seizing up if im in allergy prone areas mainly dog hair cold weather/smoke dont seem to trigger it it feels like a major handicap and while i can get through a 30 minute run and only have to use it once asthma doesnt come for a few hours after running for whatever reason ive just really come to hate my dependence on my puffer when i got my lung capacity measured about a year or two ago it was only 62 of the average and it holds me back from stuff like long speeches/diving/proper kissing as a result    is there any hope /med/
can somebody please teach me how to calculate how much weight a person can put on their legs walking up and down stairs after surgery/due to osteoporosis    eg you get body weight height length of legs width of hips height of steps can you calculate how much force and its direction is applied to one leg when walking down a staircase
i have ptsd and autism any doctors or nurses think i can cut it somewhere as a nurse
  you dont need more desu    youll learn to memorise shit for exams in a few years the things from practice you remember naturally    good control is key for asthma its kind of late to grow out of it and you cant really you just get less frequent spasms see your doc every year and if you use your puffer too much go for a change of therapy    well i can imagine it has to be in some calm ward but youll have to go through surgical wards er in your training can you handle that
  i can handle whatever is asked of me just seeing that there is a chance gives me so much hope
  thats why littmann classic is master race
  i just try to understand why something is what it is or why it is called that way even if my explanation for it is absolutely made up and fake it helps me memorize the stuff passively which is what you want to do on this career     otherwise youll get to clinical remembering absolutely shit despite your previous scores on theory it happens all the time
  exercising does increase your lung capacity tho so never stop doing it also seasonal allergies tends to decrease your basal capacity making you more prone to attacks maybe you should consider starting a long term treatment with antihistamines if not already and see if they help in anyway
  medical books are very good for self learning  guyton and halls physio  any developmental biology book  stryers biochemistry  any pathology book    youll learn everything in biological processes
premeds gassed when
  
is this normal for someone who lifts weights or am i going to die
just got a call form the medical council they will do inspection in a week  should i be worried
my knees are giving me grief they snap pop crackle all the time more than is normal for my age for years i walked a shortcut into town on uneven ground and i believe it wore my knees out    what medical professional do i see for this problem is there such a thing as a knee specialist
  did you workout the day before you had blood taken if so yes
  or mastocyte protector/leukotriene antagonist    it is especially if you excercised prior to the blood test     youll get a fine probably ive been told they can always find a way to give you a fine    orthopedist or a rheumatologist
hemoglobin is 20 g/dl  is this bad or should i not be worried
  do you smoke
  no im 23 if thats relevant
  you should see a hematologist then youre not going to die but high hemoglobin can predispose you to forming blood clots you can lower your hemoglobin level by donating blood
  probably crepitation not normal but not terrible unless its associated with pain chances are that youre stuck with it for life not much you can really do just look after your knees and dont do dumb shit
  what medical professional do i see for this problem is there such a thing as a knee specialist  also an orthopaedic surgeon with an interest in lower limbs/knees would be your best bet theyll tell you not to worry though
my gp said i might have sugma but hell have to send me to a hospital for further testing    sheeeeeit
  but needles hurt
i dont know if this is the right place to share but fuck it i need to share this  im from argentina 23 years old male 175 meters heigh 95 weight  when i was very young i got diagnosed with hypothyroidism i have been under levothyroxine since i was 12 if memory helps taking my medication when i wake up wait 20 minutes then proceed to eat and carry on with my life this had been okay for sometime but the last years things have changed  first off i think mostly because i was a retarded teenager i stopped going to my monthly endocrinologist checks i simply dismissed as not important but i keep taking my medicine the catch is that as i grow up my medicine intake should change increase with my body 2 or 3 years passed without going to the endocrinologist and taking the same amount of medicine all that time  now this last year i wanted to go get checked again but my countrys economy went to the shitter and my family had to constantly change between public healthcares which basically is not having a healthcare at all since a regular check would be a shitty one and the turns would be months ahead in schedule
  lately i have noticed there are nodules on my throat small in size but its something that wasnt before if i recall correctly i assume its my thyroid gland swelling up due the insufficient t4 and im not sure if its increasing in size and im extremely aware of this its worrying me but right now i cant get a doctor check up or i can get a particular private healthcare check up but it will fuck my wallet in the ass and im not a wealthy man  i have read some articles lately the lump is still relatively small and not visibly noticiable but when i touch my throat i can feel it its there i dont have any problem swallowing nor eating so far and i dont have localized pain or ache in my throat i cant tell if its just my adams apple which was never quite big nor noticiable or not im taking a pill of 25 micrograms every day i wake up i dont feel sick but im too conscious of my condition i only hope for an endocronologist to touch my throat get a blood test and hopefully increase my t4 intake however im not sure if i should take more medication without the approvation of a doctor so im taking the same amount of levothyroxine from the past years  im afraid im developing thyroid cancer and its increasingly making me worry and a lot    opinions /med/  also how big are the chances to actually develop thyroid cancer it tends to be benign or malign how treatable is thyroid cancer how fast does thyroid cancer develops in time should i get an emergency check up inmediadly    apologizes for the wall of text
  doxycycline bitchezzzzz
  any new meds youve taken recently  looks like a fixed drug reaction
  both would be extremely painful one will have you pass out in 3 sec the other in an excrutiating 2 min or so
  pain is a bretty good indicator ma dude
  what to do about add and depression am neet
how is it like to open someones body ive been watching some autopsies and it feels so wrong like as if we were reverse engineering gods work
    thyroid growth isnt impossible since your dose might have not been enough but without anyone touching your gland or doing an echo we cant really say just see a specialist as soon as you can you shouldnt worry about cancer though it has to be years passed in order to develop it also dont increase your dose by yourself you might go into thyrotoxicosis    let me guess you self diagnosed
    what was your weight last time you went to an endocrinologist you should be taking way more in regards to how much you weigh feel any tiredness depression always cold constipation heart beating too slow    you definitely should get your nodule checked should be worrying if its like one big more than 3cm solid nodule thats painful with multiple lumps on the sides of your neck    although i dont think you have thyroid cancer the severity of it depends on the histological structure thats why biopsy is so important
  no i went to a psychiatrist
  why do i have a feeling that tells me you docs are all high on kush with a broom up the butt
  in hospitals nothing will surpass vanc/zosyn combo lmao    in practice what do you mean new antibiotic doxy is underutilized imo but as far as new antibiotics go there isnt much in terms of any id guidelines changing afaik id say levaquin prescribing may be seen more except that theyre adding new bbw with each passing day and resistance rates are already over 10 in many locales
is there anything abnormal here  my bro has pain without cause went to dentist and she said everything was fine from surface took xray just in case
  well he should have told you what to do why ask 4chan    calculus can cause unmotivated pain also temporomandibular problems as a form of reflected pain maybe he grinds his teeth at night
    surgeons are cocky bastards but this chick beats them all shes correct but does it in a very annoying way
  looks normal from the blurry mess that i can tell  as the other anon said but i would add that sometimes the pain is reflected and can be caused by other teeth in the same jaw but from the opposite side or on the same side in the opposite jaw    thats a bad xray btw
  doxy has nasty sideeffects so i think thats why its only used for very niche infections ricketsias and such
  tiredness depression always cold    i have all these and breathlessness could barely move with tiredness today and cant see my gp until wednesday hoping its irondeficient anemia my red bloods were down last time but the doc said it wasnt anemia he also said i had asthma depsite the asthma check coming back negative    is it safe to take a small amount of iodine or a iron pill /med/ had these problems for a few months now but the past few days have been awful could i just pick up a cheap multivitamin that has iodine and iron in it
  wish i had kush
  white and rubbery taken from inside subclavian artery of individual of age less than 30 what could it be what should be watched out for
  alright thanks i knew i wasnt taking enough dosege but im not risking taking any more without proper supervision    what was your weight last time you went to an endocrinologist  my last dosage increase was when i was 17 last check up was when i was 18 id say in these times i was weighting 7075 kilograms im always between a little overweight and barely in normal weight all my life i was like that by now its normal  feel any tiredness  im sort of a lazy man i do sleep a lot although if i need to do physical activity i can do it without any problem but besides the fact i have nocturnal habits staying very late at night but besides that i dont feel tired i suppose is my bad lifestyle  depression  yes sort of i dont want to look like a pretentious selfdiagnostic idiot but since my teenager years i have had based of what i read high functioning depression deep inside im depressed and feel like shit but it doesnt stop me from being social and outgoing and nobody knows this i have a job and im studying yet i feel like an underachiever and cant help to feel bad about it  always cold  no actually the opposite i cant stand the heat not in a way that i cannot literally stand hot days i simply dislike it a lot i rather be in a cold enviroment rather than in a hot one i rather be in the cold rather in the heat  constipation  no i dont think i was ever constipated actually sometimes its the opposite diarrhea is a somewhat usual problem i have inregards of defecation but its mostly due what i eat and drink and not of a health malfunction  heart beating too slow  again the opposite its very rare and its more often when im inactive sitting on my chair on the computer or doing nothing in particular i get random fast heart beating out of the nowhere for a few seconds doesnt even last a minute    thanks for the help guys i appreciate it
  dont go there anymore since it got expensive and i stopped making progress i could use some advice
  im actually on coke ma dude   half the students are on coke or addie some on downers
  this looks like a plaque no idea how anything else can get in there     well my friend you either need psychotherapy or an antidepressant the first is like you said expensive and the other has debatable efficacy i could advice you like a normie and say go out a lot take up a hobby or something but this is the most retarded thing to say since depressed people cant just do that you have to be actively treated cardio training has some evidence that can help with depression
  yes just doesnt have the yellow from fats and isnt hard so lacking calcium just not sure what could have such an excess to build up in a short time otherwise
dentists of /med/ i got an anesthesia 2 hours ago for an extraction and im still completely numb and i can barely open my mouth last time i got a tooth pulled out it didnt last this long is it normal
  best toothpaste brand for sensetive teeth

  the paralysis is going to spread to the rest of your body over the next few days and then you will die sorry man
  paracetamol
  fuck i meant erthromycin
  it went away fucking hell it was getting annoying
  get a picture of a mouth from google and paint the location where you were injected with anesthesia using red color  2 hours is over extended perioddepending on the place where you got itexplanations could range from anesthetic typedamaged nerveor being injected anesthetic into an artery
my balls are swollen and bleed like mad do i need to go to the hospital
  thanks what about mouthwash
  can you mix amphetamine with seritonin release/ reuptake agents  like i know amphetamine reuptakes some seritonin but is it safe to use it with drugs like fluxetine or even seritonin supplements like 5htp
    is it possible to get discontinuation symptoms from an ssri several weeks after stopping or would it be immediate     i stopped taking ssri medication 6 weeks ago and just this week i started having brain zaps many times per day
  what do you mean by brain zaps
  no if you were going to get side effects from quitting you would get them within a few days and even severe withdrawals would be mostly over long before 6 weeks pass      exactly what it sounds like you get a brief sensation like a jolt of electricity in your head its a very common symptom of ssri withdrawal for unknown reasons
    what would be causing it then i get this strange sensation at the back of my head feels tingly sometimes extends down to my foot when this happens i kind of feel dizzy but not in the sense of the world spinning more a lightheaded feeling i guessit only lasts a second but happens many times per day it appeared only within the last week    i originally freaked out thinking i was having mini strokes or something but from what ive researched the brain shivers/zaps thing is probably the best description for what its like based off what others have shared but if ssri withdrawal is unlikely in my case perhaps its something else ms seizures tumor
  yup it looks like mainly connective tissue    1 for sensodyne rapid relief is the subtype i use
would a misanthropic doctor actually have any sort of advantage in the field or well would that all be hollywood shenanigans
  im not drunk enough to take this one
a couple of years ago i relapsed and did something stupid i began restricting my diet more and more and eventually i was only eating baked sweet potatoes id typically eat anywhere from 12 kg to 17 kg in one sitting    the highest blood sugar reading that i measured was 156 mmol/l 280 mg/dl at around 4 hours post meal the average would have been between 1012 mmol/l i guess i have reactive hypoglycemia or something because hours after eating this one meal id get the shakes be drenched in sweat fast heart rate etc the lowest my blood sugar has been during one of these episode is 18 mmol/l 32 mg/dl again i did something dumb when id have these hypos rather than eating something id just ride them out as i was only allowed to eat once a day lol my average reactive hypo episode would have been between 24  28 mmol/l    i ate purely sweet potatoes for 23 months but eventually i added kidney beans to mix as i had low albumin levels and elevated alt and ast from there i was eating sweet potatoes  kidney beans for several months eventually a switch or something flipped in my brain as i started binging and ate a jar of peanut butter every day in addition to other foods for several months and then put on all the weight i had starved myself losing yay    anyway i am curious about if any damage would have taken place due to me riding out the lows rather than eating i have read about people fainting going into comas etc at blood sugars higher than my lowest why wasnt i comatose at 18 mmol/l
  misanthropy is great way to implement equity for all humans
  go see a doctor but im 95 certain that you just eat like a typical 4chan slob and arent eating enough fibre
had a lump/cyst next to my ear under the skin of my sideburn for about 5 months on the 2nd month gave ear a good clean and it went down but came up within a week just left it alone and its only recently going down now feels good wtf was it a cyst
  some people are initially disgusted by it but everyone gets over it pretty fast
  you can be a dick if you are hard to replace its not an advantage to anyone
is it normal for every single joint in your body to make popping and crunching sounds in their normal range of motion even my jaw and spine do it
this is the worst /medgen/ ive seen since we started having these answering the dickheads asking for medical advice is only going to encourage them and shit it up worse post stories of shitty patients   7 yo f with rlq pain   eating well one minor fever 377  preceeded by urti  ct suggestive of mesenteric adenitis  admit anyway due to parental concern  continues to improve no fevers obs wnl pain improves  parents still concerned despite spending way too long telling them she doesnt have appendicitis  eventually calls ryans rule patient/family initiated review of patient by senior second doctor  he decides to open her up and have a look  sigh internally and scrub up  appendix not inflammed  some small visible nodes in the mesentery  remove appendix anyway  discuss surgery with family they are still concerned because you havent found a diagnosis  bitch you have been told multiple times she has mesenteric adenitis you got an unnecessary appendectomy what more do you want  cunts
anyone have tips for dealing with laryngopharyngeal reflux disease had this shit for a while and its fucken killing me ive been on ppi pantoprazole 40mg for 5 months and its lessened the symptoms but i am still refluxing into my throat and possible my lungs scared as fuck that ima get pulmonary fibrosis from the acid shit hurts like a motherfucker ive lost 60lbs in the last 5 months and still refluxing i eat a safe as fuck diet low fat low carbs and small meals everyday and fast for 16 hours still reflux     the ent said ive had this condition for a long time so its gonna take a long time to heal but im scared that ima just have this forever and get cancer or pf by the time im in my 30s
  how do i cure my cholinergic urticaria
                                    all of you should kill yourselves for asking for free medical help on 4chan
  but im on deaths door anon and i trust 4chan with my life
  the real question is why werent you treated for you psychiatric problem as you clearly had one the answer to your question is because your brain could handle it just dont be a retard and eat a balanced diet holy fuck why is it so hard for normies to understand that    this is the worst /medgen/ ive seen since we started having these answering the dickheads asking for medical advice is only going to encourage them and shit it up worse  i agree and i admit im guilty for answering some of them and holy shit that story made me cringe
  oh no no
can someone redpill me on medical physicist as a career  ive been looking into it and it seems too good to be true
internal medicine or radiology i have to choose tomorrow
  radiology if u wanna lose a nut and go sterile and internal medicine if u wanna sit around all day trying be smart
  this this this
  rad has the big bucks i think im can be kinda boring
are there any actual md students or mds on 4chan  i feel like i dont even see an md presence on the internet even chubbyemu is a pharmd  are they just that busy
  it seems like the further down the medical ladder you go the more misanthropic you get  nurses and emts tend to be more misanthropic emts being more misanthropic than nurses  doctors are generally welladjusted people super inshape as well ive noticed basically ubermenschen
  could you actually survive such a fall and wound with practically no professional medical attention  i remember hearing on /k/ some time ago from some emts that surviving such a fall is a one in a million chance without professional medical help due to it neither ripping open any arteries and bleeding him dry within minutes nor puncturing any intestines which would have caused an almost certainly fatal infection of the abdomen
would human experimentation further science in a substantial way or is that already going down but hidden
  humans and mice are so similar biologically that its rarely necessary  trials in human patients are already done but only after mouse tests    on the other hand we did keep a lot of the data we got from mengele and unit 731
if i had a lower gpa in college but did a postbac and got a really high gpa would that improve my chances of med school  would there even be a point i mean im 24 now i guess with a twoyear postbac id be in my earlymid 30s before i even started practicing
  there are plenty of doctors on 4chan  i am one of them 4chan is a place for smart people to act dumb and for dumb people to be in good compamy so its no wonder noone can recognise us
  he isnt an md by his mid twentys    oh no no sweetie
  i guess im different because i didnt really start school to be a doctor i wanted to go into social work so i cared less about gpa
  most people who refuse to change bad habits are bad especially if influenced by normiebook and bad studies  62 yo male with bmi of fukkin 45  smokes 2 packs a day drinks 56 days a week moderately  keeps coming to clinic to complain of back pain and that his herbal tea diet and green tea extract pills arent helping him loose weight  try to make him at least take his rosuvastatin and hydrochlorothiazide  tells everyone he believes its all big pharma that takes his money and meds help him in no way  tell him to at least try taking it easy on the smokes and booze  he actually brought in a printed copy of   i hate working with these kind of people
  how did that get published in a real journal
  /med/ has some md frequents im a last year student doing rotations and i make most /med/ threads though i gotta admit threads have been boring lately    it would actually but you knowethics       what a fucking douche thats why i want to work in intensive care all your patients are unconscious or intubated if they can talk most times they have to be discharged from intensive care and i wont deal with their bulshit
is there any way for a medfag to make a living online since idiots nowdays will do anything to avoid going to the doctor see this thread how viable of a career would online md be
  life happens im 21 and just getting started on my undergrad degree if i successfully become a doctor ill be mid thirties once i finish residency
  isnt that an american only thing
  i heard 26 people get made fun of in med school is this true
  idk i am open to traveling the world main reason i am studying medicine
  not at my school there are a handful of people 30 years old in the program they dont get made fun of or shit like that they actually get respect for having the guts and effort to go back to university a lot of these people left their careers to start all over in medicine  ive actually seen younger students have more trouble in med school not by students and faculty but by the people they treat  you look too young to be a doctor  you cant possibly be experienced enough to treat me
  radiologists can sit on their asses all day and do reports on cases thousands of miles away if thats what you mean
this may sound insane but hear me out   im writing a paper on the allergy response and the prof is encouraging us to write in a way that wouldnt be incomprehensible to the layman    i want to use this chapter of cells at work as a source for this paper while the science isnt a total comprehensive rundown of what happens when we experience allergies there is some good simple information that i could easily incorporate into my paper    is this insane or should i do it
  dont be a sperg anon just cite a basic textbook
  i saw something like this in a path lab fucking clear cell carcinoma was tracking up the renal vein the whole kidney was removed scary shit
any advice for someone who sucks at chemistry and is in orgo got as in all my math and physics classes so far in uni but got cs in gen chem 2 semesters because i was too smart to study/attend lecture/read the textbook/do homework now im in 1st semester organic and barely have a bc im getting absolutely fucked because i have no concept of nucleo/electrophilicity or orbitals should i just start over at gen chem 1 finally realizing 147 iq doesnt make me any better than my peers when they have solid background and im a lazy retard with no work ethic
  look up kleins organic chemistry workbooks and complete them i hope youre in a state school my 2nd semester at jhu i looked at the ucsb orgo tests for their final term and saw that it was content we covered in the first semester
  thats why i want to work in intensive care  icu nurse here be careful what you wish for families can be just as bad    young adult male transferred to unit after cardiac arrest  pt is intubated  doc sent him here for more investigative studies to hopefully turn his condition around  turns out the cardiac arrest caused pronounced hypoxia  no treatment is working  cerebral perfusion studies coming back showing no hope  family fights to keep him on life support  brain death confirmed  family fights it  gets to the point that family members are getting into heated verbal arguments with the doctors residents nurses personal support workers and even maintenance workers  whoever gets near his room is accused of trying to unplug his machine
  so youre coming to terms with the fact that youre a brainlet id suggest buckling up and finally putting the fuckin effort in or quit and change majors to bio or something easier
  im in southeastern europe icus are from a centralised type here and families are not allowed anywhere near the patient they can be a pain in the arse though like you said but i hope with the right approach you can get them to listen in these cases dont people of authority like the head of the icu come as a solution people tend to listen to strong personality figures
fellas why does cervical anatomy make me wanna neck myself  i look at the corpse and beyond the few things i recognize it just looks like an organic physical server managment from hell picture
  are you doctor    is tnt nanotransfection real will it work on humans    
  you could do some real unethical shit with the brain that would be very usefulel
  i mean look at all the insights mengele gained doing the most unethical shit to their untermenschen
  this    67 yo weighs around 130 kg  constant smoking and dip full on alcoholic  eats only fast food  colorectal cancer  surgeon refuses to operate unless he cleans up  does so  resumes immediately after surgery   cancer keeps showing up  no more surgery  you will probably lose your hair due to chemo  doesnt lose his hair  never fails to bring this up  full remission  continues his old life without even blinking  have to see this fucker annually
  do you do any drugs or have you in the past several months some mainly mdma and its precursors can induce the brain zaps youre talking about im assuming you wouldve mentioned that in your original post though if you had been taking illicit substances are you on any other medications what was the antidepressant and how long were you on it ive never heard of such delayed onset but maybe its possible if you had been on the ssri for a prolonged period of time
  probably the opposite politics plays a large role in advancement in medicine which means you need to play nice still you can pretty much be a dick as much as you want if youre in a field without too much patient contact like pathology or radiology
  not patients but the parents i have genuinely thought about killing people       regards pediatric psychiatry
  yes with the right approach some family members figure its best to just let nature take its course     in these cases dont people of authority like the head of the icu come as a solution people tend to listen to strong personality figures  yeah but then they accuse the director of trying to play god by choosing when their family member lives or dies  in the case i brought up the family figured it out after 2 weeks when no lawyer would represent them in court theres no guideline or rule about brain death in this province canada and 2 previous cases were dismissed in the past
  thats absurd average matriculant age across american medical schools have been on an upward trend for the last several years no one will say shit unless youre a 50 year old man
  bio majors still have to take ochem for med school in the us
  thanks for letting me know
is dental school a good way to go if i am too much of a brainlet for medical school
  not really because dental school is still extremely competitive and you wont get in without a strong gpa and application
    pharma school is an option though its a little different id prefer it to the insides of mouths all day
  bio is harder than premed especially cmol and biomath they take the full o chem course plus upper division lab courses and senior research projects med school is in every way less intensive unless you are gonna be a surgeon
  how the fuck could anyone even post something like this bio is the easiest of all the sciences if you had said physics or engineering you could have at least made the case that theres difficult math or something i studied biochemistry before med school and shit was a joke in comparison especially ochem
  youre right that a biology major is easy but some biology degrees require physics
  yeah i guess pharmacy school is an option but i think i would have that as a last resort ive worked as a pharmacy technician and i just dont want to memorize all the drugs medical school right now is my top priority
this isnt necessarily med but just bio related sort of didnt think it wasnt worthy of a thread though apparently domesticated animals have smaller crania and brainsize as a general rule pic rel is a drastic example obviously   iwas reading this   the two scientists point to the results of studies comparing the cognitive abilities of wolves and dogs wolves with their larger brains are more prone to flashes of insight allowing them to solve problems on their own dogs with smaller brains excel at using humans to help them wolves seem to be a little bit more persistent than dogs in solving simple problems like how to open a box or navigate a detour hare says wolves persevere when dogs readily give up on the flip side dogs leave wolves in the dust when it comes to tracking the gaze and gestures of their mastersor as hare puts it they are very good at using humans as tools to solve problems for them   the encephalization quotient i think is smaller in domesticates as well  anybody care to comment  i think some of this is related to androgens but thats just speculation on my part
not sure if this is /med/ related but would getting a career in genetics be a wise idea it seems like it would be very lucrative what do you guys think
  forgot to add to this but im talking about genetic engineering
  theres no guideline or rule about brain death in this province canada and 2 previous cases were dismissed in the past  its a gray area in many countries    maybe we can say natural selection played a part here domesticated animals didnt need traits like insight since they had their human masters other traits like reading their masters developed and stayed in the generations       if theres a niche in your country hell yeah
  obviously retard im a pharmd do you not get that i know what im talking about just from reading what i said doesnt mean tetracyclines/doxy arent underutilized
  and its not used just for niche infections used for malaria prophylaxis 2nd/3rd line treatment for many ids acne treatment etc
  i mean clinical genetics is a thing if that tickles your fancy
  thanks ive never heard of that before
  depends on what you want to do as long as youre ready to get an advanced degree i think genetics would be a great field of study theres still tons to learn and biotechnology is rapidly advancing well see more and more radical genetic engineering in our lifetime the bottleneck is having enough geneticists to interpret the data
  well i have been planning on going to medical school with a biology degree but i have been getting second thoughts about biology
  fuck off tranny
engineering is now a meme  being a developer code monkey is now a meme  working in finance is now a meme    is being a doctor the only career thats worth it now
  well im planning on working in the medical field just because i cant be replaced
  depends on what you mean by worth it just do a simple cost/benefit analysis what do you get for an md assuming us  massive salary with almost unlimited potential for growth through private practice and subspecialization  universal respect from society  government   fulfillment if you like helping people  what do you give up to become an md  insane education costs several hundred thousands of dollars  no life from the age of 1830  constant stress from keeping a high gpa in undergrad extracurriculars research mcat passing medical school boards residency  broke as shit during undergrad medical school and residency  overworked during medical school and residency  massive opportunity cost  spend your 20s studying and working for chump change while being insulted by senior doctors and patients  with all that said its worth it if its the only thing you can see yourself doing if there are any other options for you id strongly suggest looking into them this may sound arrogant or pretentious but people who are not in medicine have no idea just how tiring difficult and frustrating it is to become a doctor its honestly insanity
  im just going to assume youre in medicine do you regret going down that path if you do what else would have liked to work in
ive had an odd smell inside my left ear for months now but i can only feel it when i insert my finger in it and it dissapears from the finger after a while also the part shown in pic related as cavum conchae in the lower part of the earhole is lightly swollen as if i had a pimple or a cyst i woke up with a strong pain in this ear some days ago but it simply went away after a day  could this be an infection and are these related iirc the smell started after the swelling    another q i have a rather big cyst in my back from what ive read these things can be dangerous and cause cancer in some cases is this true should i visit a doctor for this i had an appointment to check it but i forgot about it
  do you regret going down that path if you do what else would have liked to work in  no i dont regret it at all its the only thing that i can see myself doing my undergrad degree was in business rather than biology so i likely wouldve worked some shit tier job until eventually starting my own business ill say that if your primary aim is money do not try and become a doctor its a bad idea and something that people often misunderstand everyone gets dazzled by the high salaries but the reality is youre in school minimum 8 years in which your income is grossly negative then youre worked like a slave during residency for barely any money for an additional 3 years at least     if you want to get rich go into finance or technology or even just general business if youre even a little financially literate youll do a lot better than many doctors its actually funny because most of my colleagues are unbelievably bad with money and will invest in any deal that comes their way i think doctors are typically pretty smart as long as you think memorization and application of clinical research takes intelligence but most of us are hopeless when it comes to things outside of medicine like personal relationships finances hobbies etc you give up a lot to become a physician you dont have to if youre a 145 iq superstar but most of us had to sacrifice a lot to get here
  thanks i would have thought that doctors have it well in personal relationships oh well and the only thing really im on the fence about with becoming a doctor is the time sacrifice really im pretty certain i dont have to worry too much about the costs though i live in texas so medical school is cheap there unless im just largely ignorant to any other costs
  you have canser and 2 days to live
  haha so funny  btw i already had cancer hodgkin lymphoma and ive had had this cyst n my back for years
  no in your ear moron the backcyst is fine
redpill me in psychiatry /med/ i want to study things that approach more to neurophisiology and things related more to mind and not only neuronal anatomy also how is the job is really depressive
  no in your ear moron  can they extirpate my ears i dont want cancer again and i dont need them anyway i fucking hate noises i wish i had been born deaf
why dont you guys just make something that dissolves arterial plaque like just get rid of it lmao cure heart disease
  what a coincidence im in texas too lucky you if you really want to go the medical school route texas is hands down the most friendly state for applicants because of the local quotas public medical schools here are forced to take mostly texan residents somewhere in the realm of 7090 iirc on the personal relationships thing ill just say theres a reason doctors tend to marry other doctors the horrendous hours and long nights on call depending on your specialty can put a lot of strain on a relationship or marriage    the time sacrifice is horrendous youll probably always work way more than the average person but youll be compensated better too i recently read an article that said the average physician works around 55 hours a week averaged out over their career im not sure if thats accurate or not since obviously a significant portion of it is frontloaded during residency im just now finishing up and even though there are laws that prevent residents from working for days straight you can still expect to be raked over the coals and its not unusual to be pulling over nighters and working 80 hours a week attendings are a lot more chill with their work hours though and obviously there are specialties like private derm or plastics where you can make your own hours and work as much or as little if you want however starting out youll be a hospital bitch like me and its a grind im not trying to talk you out of it because i think its the most badass career in the world but medicine is glorified in media which leads to lots of people thinking it is overly glamorous truth is there is lots of paperwork fuckloads of studying lots of boring hoops to jump through and lots of politics to navigate still you save lives pretty much every day depending on what youre doing by applying occasional cutting edge scientific techniques thats pretty cool
  thanks really appreciate your responses what was your gpa to get into medical school im at am and apparently 90 of all aggies matriculate if their gpa is over 35 that seems suspiciously low     
okay  let us say that i am a nontraditional applicant to medical school coming from a nonmedical field of study i had a 30 gpa in this field of study social work i skipped a bunch of assignments since grades matter far less than experience and being able to write a good paper  but now i am interested in medicine where i know grades matter far more  if i were to do some kind of postbaccalaureatte study have industry experience as an emt my job right now and have a lot of medical volunteering under my belt and destroy the mcat would i have even a chance of getting in
can i still get histology job with 27 gpa
anyone have any experience with joint md/phd programs i just finished an undergrad in math and statistics and got into medical school which i start next year the university i got into offers a joint md/phd program where you do 2 extra years doing your phd in the middle of medical school and i was wondering if i could potentially use my math major for something useful in this kind of program ive read that your phd can be on anything you want but was wondering if that was realistic and if any of you have experience or know people who are trying to do that
  yes anon 2 md students and 3 mds i know browse and post daily on 4chan and from time to time on these threads    you are very right about that you get to travel around the world in your lifetime conferences on japan austria switzerland etc
  tfw youve called anons friends faggots  i wonder if my friends have called me a faggot on here before
just finished three poorly designed weeder units and one easy one  gpa only went down a tiny bit  i was almost yelling at strangers in the street by the end does rad tech school get easier theyre making us do research alongside our placements now because things cant be straightforward anymore
  why dont you just do neurology or neuroscience then you realize psychiatry is just weeding out people looking for drugs and giving ones to legit cases
  its probably not worth it for me then    3 years of retail has unironincally made me a bit of a misanthrope im not a full edgelord as there are still certain people in this world i like but if i could get away with killing the hr bitch or a dumb customer id do it
  unironically
is there ever going to be a cure for hypothyroidism im tired of taking pills every day and feeling so low energy if i forget or dont have time to collect my prescription due to work
  its probably an infection go to an ear doc    well if you could program your cells to get to work again then maybe yes a lot of hope is put into crispr but im not sure how good is to overhype it until then pills for you
have you guys seen sloppy nurses  be me intern  rotation in pediatric icu  hang around nurses  assist with blood withdrawal and canulations or do them myself  for some reason in pediatric ward they dont use adaptors for blood withdrawal but instead they puncture the vein with a needle and the blood drips in the vial  lots of times you get blood on you so you gotta use gloves you never know what the little fuckers have also for their safety as well  theres this one old nurse  very good at venepuncture but sloppy as fuck  doesnt wear gloves  gets blood all over her hands every fucking time  often times doesnt say what shes doing and asks me to assist without myself putting on gloves and gets blood on me and her both  urethral catheterisations and breathing tubes arent cleaned with gloves either  they wonder why their patients have nosocomial infections    i swear when i start working i wont let shit like that pass and this is common with all oldschool nurses
  doesnt wear gloves  gloves were not mandatory in large part of procedures in any medical branch up until the hiv paranoia in the 90s  old doctors and nurses know this and they dont give a fuck  my dad does the same
  stop selling refined oils  problem solved and there is instant deficit of dietary oils for consumption of 6 billion people  thats right a gram of butter will cost as much as a gram of gold
  have you guys seen sloppy nurses  not related to not wearing gloves but    old nurse in charge of 24 patients  instead of prepping the patients meds when shes by their room she puts them all on the med cart at the start of her med pass  shes always mixing up the fucking meds  has been written up for medication mistakes tonnes of times  unit just has her supervised at all times  she hasnt been fired or disciplined  for every good nurse you get you find 2 like this
  wmen shouldnt be allowed to be nurses tbqh
how can it people help doctors other than already existant apps and stuff what kind of technology would help making your job easier    some examples   a device for you to keep track of whatever info you need medicine given to patients hours youve worked etc etc   something that makes it easier to inform patients of the expected/probable effects of their illnesses and the medicines they are taking etc   a decent internal network  web applications  computers for doctors to talk and share info in your workplace hospital clinic whatever    i wish i could help the people that have helped me and if there are some people that have helped me a lot in one way or another were doctors
  gotta give more info does it sting or itch detailed descriptions on both the discolored and red areas
  something anything to help the nurses
  like what something to keep track of patients their data and what to give to them etc can you give some examples
if i get a do will mds make fun of me
    t udemy need who learned python on a free code website and thinks hes going to change the entire medical industry and collect neetbux by asking 4chan losers in /med/ what a big problem in their industry is so he can come to the rescue and make the best most effecient solution and collect millions and finally get out of his moms basement    sadly he doesnt realize theres already multi million dollar development agencies and industries working in the medical field creating answers to all the problems hed probably find here and actually doing it because they have competent employees    next
  then where do i get my milky milky rub tugs from when im feeling ill
  t udemy need who learned python on a free code website and thinks hes going to change the entire medical industry and collect neetbux by asking 4chan losers in /med/ what a big problem in their industry is so he can come to the rescue and make the best most effecient solution and collect millions and finally get out of his moms basement  projecting much  i have a well paid job ironically i was hired and got paid well immediately when i started without even having a degree after beating cancer then becoming a neet for 5 years  ive read about the nightmare that is it in health so i wouldnt touch it with a 10 ft pole not unless i genuinely wanted to help      sadly he doesnt realize theres already multi million dollar development agencies and industries working in the medical field creating answers to all the problems hed probably find here and actually doing it because they have competent employees  also ironic seeing how the previous poster actually showed that there are needs not covered by these great multi million dollar development agencies and industries companies working in the medical field creating answers to all the problems hed probably find here    now kys for replying to me without contributing faggot
  you baited me but all oldschool nurses regardless of gender should just retire already like the post said  old nurse  theyre not the best their knowledge is outdated and they refuse to get a refresher hell had one old guy nurse/emt say that he didnt want to get the flu vaccine cause hed shed the virus from the shot to his sick patients he gave in and got the shot but then wore an n95 mask for 3 days afterwards when on the unit thinking it was providing protection
  sorry was working on school work im actually getting educated to go into a high paying job sector while you waste your life away in your moms basement daydreaming about the new medical app youll never make get a life loser    next
  sorry was working on school work im actually getting educated to go into a high paying job sector  top kek  meanwhile ive learned most of what i know by myself because i like what i do i get paid well and people respect me for my knowledge   oh and btw if i wanted to make money with some app or whatever shit i could easily just not in anything related to medicine there is a lot more money elsewhere    get a life loser  says the one without a life  just stop projecting and stop worrying about my life retard its none of your business
  not patients but the parents  i agree with this below is a story from my student days    2 year old admitted to acute peds unit  subacute sclerosing panencephalitis  have him in full isolation room since hes reported to have never been vaccinated  parents are the hippietype herbal junkies  despite the illness being a direct result of their refusal to vaccinate they always cry muh poor baby  they were actually trying to push for hypnosis therapy to help with the seizures the kid was having    the nurse and physician in charge eventually called child protective services the parents never having brought their kid in to a pediatrician being the major factor to call  i always wonder if the kid eventually recovered
how do i start pooping more than once a week
  eat more vegetables
  not giving a fuck about nosocomial infections    ive seen this too     a decent internal network  web applications  computers for doctors to talk and share info in your workplace hospital clinic whatever  this communication is so shitty at times and existing systems are so buggy    i always wonder if the kid eventually recovered  he probably died anon theres no cure for that      and drink water
    duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuude
  imagine what that felt like to cough out
  math and statistic skills are very valuable for research your degree will definitely be useful
  36 years old
  bicuspid aorta valve is a bitch
  probably an ivdu
  he probably died anon theres no cure for that  yeah even if he was a lucky one who wasnt part of the 95 mortality rate hed probably be really messed up       holy shit
  im not a doctor and im not knowledgeable enough to understand how something like that happens can someone explain stuff like this is interesting but it terrifies me

what do you guys think about schizos that post incoherent ramblings in /sci/ 
  are you black
my exbf gave me tea today and it tasted bitter ive had this exact tea before its not supposed to be bitter clogged and coated my throat and left that sticky slimy cum feeling on my lips is there any way to test if he actually put semen in it the tea isnt clear so i cant look for it without contacting officials i have a significant amount of chemistry equipment in my home so as long as the method isnt extremely complicated i should be able to analyze the tea please help /med/ i dont want to be tricked into drinking cummies qwq
  of course his black how else do you think a non white can get into higher education without affirmative action by the sjw
  separate for proteins or some shit you dont need a background in medicine its just chemistry look up components of nut and find something you know how to extract that is also not in the tea tell me if your ex is slipping you cum
  oh also i just remembered nut is alkaline so depending on how much you could just do a ph test compared to regular tea as a control but there might not be a big enough difference
  please make a thread about this later i need to know
be at small private walkinclinic  get middle aged male  nurse fast tracked him to see me and called for an ambulance  can see why  jaundiced all over  in for ruq pain nausea/vomiting weakness diaphoretic  ask a few questions and do a quick assessment before the ambulance arrives  do you drink alcohol  yes  how frequently a week  every day  how early in a day do you start drinking  as soon as i can  how many drinks in a day  drink more than a case of beer  would you consider yourself as having an alcohol problem or dependency  absolutely not  last i heard he needs a liver transplant hes not getting it with the alcohol issue though its hard to believe people can have this much denial

what do yall think of this    nurse injects vecuronium instead of versed and patient dies      godspeed
  he had advanced heart failure which means the heart cant pump the blood from the pulmonary vasculature its not a small amount of blood so it needed to go somewhere apparently it made its way into his bronchi where it coagulated in the form of the bronchial tree the receptors in the bronchi detected the blood and he attempted to cough it out and he did eventually     they shit on every controversial thread with their crazy conspiracies im surprised how the antivax schizo hasnt come to shit on this /med/ thread but these are more the schizoid types for the full blown schizos that make 0 sense i feel bad because they cant really help it    should a plain microscopy give an answer shouldnt some of the swimmers keep their structure evne though dead    low intelligence combined with encephalopathy and presto    how stupid do you have to be and how didnt anyone act adequately after that it says cardiac arrest in the article but it was probably from the apnea as vecuronium cant induce a cardiac arrest by itself the basic and advanced life support protocols should have saved him maybe i dont know this seems so absurd to me so bad for that person /    btw im so glad the thread took up but its sad that were reaching the bump limit /
medfags how much time did immunology lectures lasted in your college weve got 3 weeks every other day for about 2 hours per lecture i think thats too few lectures for such an important part of medicine is it like this everywhere or is it just shitty eastern european college organization  literature abbas

  i am raj  pull on my taj  you will be fine fren do a bio premed track take as many pertinent chem and bio courses as you can stomach do the bare minimum for math since youre a brainlet almost no use for thinking at all
  be top of your class publish research papers score 80th percentile on your mcat have good letters of recommendation interview    medicine is an elite profession not for slackers
  any easier medical career that makes six figures you recommend im worried im too much of a brainlet
  be top of your class  easy if youre very intelligent  publish research papers  not a sign of hard work at the undergrad level a sign of connections and having guidance along the way hey son you gotta do this if you want to go to med school like ol pa  score 80th percentile on your mcat  easy if youre very intelligent  have good letters of recommendation  not a matter of not slacking  requires knowing people being rich helps you cant afford lunch you arent really going to be networking with that many people you might get a letter from a professor or two maybe your pcp but its not going to be that consequential unless its from some hot shot t nontrad med student at one time who spent two years dealing with extra npc bullshit to satisfy these sort of attitudes  honestly your post reads like some low iq person who is upset when some intelligent person comes along and does something better than you despite not doing as much busybody work so you try to make up an excuse to justify where you are i assume you also were the kind of person who made flash cards and had difficulty studying   entrance to medical school should be based on iq gpa and mcat everything else is arbitrary there is a reason why so many women and minorities are in medicine now
  some of the brightest physicians i know are slackers

  we had one semester every other week with a lecture of about hour and a half with lab exrcises too every other week southeastern europe here but we studied immunology in biology microbiology physiology pathophysiology and pathoanatomy as well    kekd
  but we studied immunology in biology microbiology physiology pathophysiology and pathoanatomy  well so did we if you look at it from a certain angle but its just small references to what we learned already nothing new and nothing much expanding your knowledge of immuno
  did you even read the article its far from the only side effect

  hey question for any doctors/med students in thread    i was trying to fall asleep last night with my gf and after laying in bed for about 10 minutes her teeth started clattering and she started to get random spasms every half second or so i asked her if she was ok and she responded but she didnt seem to realise that she was doing it after that it repeated some 5 minutes later and i stayed awake the whole night listening and it didnt happen again  can this be normal falling asleep shes 20 years old and doesnt have any history of neurologic disease in her family
  well you only need the basics for clinical practice really if you want to dwell into stuff you can specialise in it     thicc is the truth anon  not fat  still lots of flesh    yes its called bruxism lots of people have it
  somewhat based
  speaking of bruxism i never suggest mouth guards to remedy bruxism and detest their use ive prescribed baclofen and buspirone for nocturnal teeth grinding with some success  it never made sense to me the mouth guards are rigid and designed prevent tooth friction/erosion as though thats what theyre worried about the jaw is still clenched and now it cant go anywhere with the mouth piece preventing movement you have additional torque on the temporomandibular joint and thats just going to make the situation go from bad to worse the teeth are cosmetic in comparison to headache tmjarthritis chronic jaw pain etc i wouldnt be surprised if mouthguard wearing individuals with bruxism are at a higher risk for trigeminal neuralgia than the general population

its mostly a curiosity thing i dont have any problems but either way it might be kind of gross so if youre eating right now stop reading  i was trying to get some fluff out of my belly button and because i couldnt get it out with my finger i used some tweezers  now by separating the cheeks of my belly button to try and find hair and fabric stuck in there i noticed a layer of this sort of white fluff maybe not even fluff deeper than youd ever see without them being separated  what is that its not as fluffy as the fluff youd generally have coming out of your bellybutton its i guess denser ive decided not to poke around in case its important so i dont have a clear idea of its texture  is it normal is it just dirt skin and shit building up and festering in there or is it intentional so to speak and serves a purpose  i tried googling white stuff in belly button or white fluff in belly button and i only found clickbait articles yammering for years about the magnificence of the umbilical cord and links discussing discharges and other infectionlike conditions    ive decided against posting a picture because its not really gore or shit or anything its still kind of gross imo

is medicine a good field for an aspie kinda drifting along currently and deeply unsure what do with my life i have an iq of 137 according to the test taken during my diagnosis but my graduated from my german grammar school with an average of 36 or a gpa of 17 in us terms which would still allow me to study medicine but makes the way to it quite substantially harder
i just realized i didnt want to study medicine but i get my md in six months    is there any specialty that pays well and has almost zero contact with patients
  do you dislike contact with patients in general or just contact with living patients in the latter case just become a pathologist

how hard would it be to get into med school if i am 30 or so right now i am 21 and about to graduate with a bachelors in electrical engineering and going to do a masters then get a job and save up money to return to school i would like to just start now but i would have 12 more years of prereqs and my scholarship runs out before then honestly just doing it for the money and not ashamed and ready for anything to succeed and get through it all i have a 395/400 at a good university and dont think the grades would be hard to get but what else do i need for med school applications to get in just research and grades like grad school

  im  and i actually have bruxism and was considering a mouth guard but i didnt get around to buying one exactly because i have tmj problems and i just think it wouldnt help that much i have also been considering baclofen and now you hyped me up for it also do you have young patients with tmjarthritis i dont have xrays of my joints but i have some crepitations and im worried about developing it early in my life ill probably have it in the future but i want to postpone it as much as possible in general tell me more about your patients    desquamated cells find it hard to get out of deep belly buttons so they stay there in the form of scabs its basically dead tissue and it wont give you problems but personally it would annoy the fuck out of me my gf sometimes lets me clean hers    if you actually have equipment for modern forensic analysis then yes in my country its terribly underpaid and they have equipment from the 60s its not useless and they can do their job but its easier if you have the modern stuff

  why is light so slow  because any speed that is the upper limit of the universe will appear slow because it is finite in a possibly infinite universe  this the best it can do  anything faster would entail an increase in the speed of causality so logically no
  because any speed that is the upper limit of the universe will appear slow because it is finite in a possibly infinite universe    if it crossed the universe in two seconds it would not appear slow but i guess its all relative to our subjective experience of time passing it seems slow because 200 years is a lot of time for us
  light doesnt have a speed
  is this semantics
  not really light doesnt travel
  its the speed of time not light
convince me the earth isnt flat    pic not related
technically speaking the earth is flat because the universe is flat too
  mountains exist
    here you go
in the flat earth model why can people in the north see stars that people cant in the south and vice versa why do stars appear to rotate in different directions in those hemispheres
  who cares about what you think
  fish eye lens
  if it was thats not what itd look like
  convince me to spend my free time arguing with a braindead faggot and maybe i will
  a fisheye lens causes bulging near the center of the lens but the start of the globe is off camera
  okay i guess its probably roughly spherical
  we did it reddit
first you need a gun and a bullet then take the gun with the loaded bullet and proceed to pull the trigger with the danger end pointed at your head you should get some results
so climate change how hecked are we
ehhhh youre probably fine as long as you dont live in florida or south carolina    most impoverished regions in the world will have their agriculture destroyed but youre posting on 4ching so youre probably fine
heres the optimism tier list  very optimistic artificial general intelligence is developed soon and is nice it solves all the worlds problems   optimistic global warming is a hoax something something jews reptilians the trilateral commission least likely option  neutral horrible ecological and farming damage results in famine in poor countries worldwide economy is hurt all countries finally wake up and finally work hard on fixing the situation  bad same as above but instead of cooperating they keep polluting and start resource wars mass famine and migrations lead to unprecedented death tolls large sections of currently livable land turn into deserts or sink under water   very bad world war 3 or the agi we build isnt friendly
absolute fake  
  nope  
maybe were hecked but the the defining characteristic of humanity is that we dont give up till the bitter end
  most impoverished regions in the world will have their agriculture destroyed  youre fine  maybe you havent noticed but there is a refugee crisis already right now
  well be fine once trump finishes that wall     it will be just like that wall in world war z
most positive outlook is that standard of living will drop significantly
  only for 3rd worlders rich countries will do fine in their ivory towers
  no third worlders will get embroiled in war for us it is going to be a poorer existence
  i live in a shithole and i will probably die
  where do you think your clothes computers etc come from
  3rd world collapses  jobs finally come back to us  all according to trumps master plan
  yay who didnt say as a kid when i grow up i want to work in a sweatshop
  oh fuck didnt think about it quite like that
  fighting climate change is fascism in disguise its a premise for government to control private companies
  several of the countries that are going to get wrecked by climate change in particular india and pakistan have nuclear weapons when they collapse and their nuclear arsenals end up in the hands of people who will hate those rich countries do you really think your ivory tower will protect you
  what is automation    retard
  it is automation if a chinese can do it
  not a job
  agi  the only hoax in this thread
  its a premise for government to control private companies  which should happen anyway
   finally come back to us  implying this will not drop standard of living outsourcing shit to 3rd world countries improves the standard of living for 1st world countries
  according to the milankovich cycle we should be slowly cooling into a glacial period over the next ten thousands years instead we are warming an order of magnitude faster than interglacial warming dunning kruger
perspective depends on your event horizon    1 year  shit migration and extreme weather are threats to civilized nations  1 decade  not much of an issue unless governments try to use it as an excuse for a power grab increased crop production  1 century  desertification and mass extinction are a real possibility likely civil unrest/war  1 millenium  it was going to happen anyway the earth is always changing and it was once much warmer than current tempuratures
  ok this is terrifying i dont really care though lol
  i deny scientific facts because i dont like what they imply  hello sjw
  explain
  if we actually survive long enough to develop space elevators and conquer the solar system then we can just set up some mirrors in space
  implying that pic related wont happen  our problems and answers are in the future
    so climate change  fake news
  retard alert
  yes anon tell us about how technology is just going to magically stop developing or your superstitions about human consciousness being some supernatural magical thing thats not reproducible
  2 million years ago  so climate change how hecked are we    stupid tribe wont believe fire is cause and refuses to give me shiny sea shells to piss on their fires
  space elevators are literally impossible and space mirrors will destroy the environment by killing off oxygen producing plant life
unless we convince people to start living as nature intended the entire biosphere is doomed    i wouldnt mind if humans went extinct its the damage theyll do in the process of doing so that pains me
  this trying to combat climate change on any meaningful scale at this point will result in so much loss in new technological development that it will most likely delay the adoption of actual sustainable energy     think of it this way we need to get walking on our feet but we are on the ground we better use our goddamn hands to help us up even if we cant walk on them forever which nobody wants to do save oil giants so long as there is no active suppression of development were set and theres literally the opposite going on
everybody should at least try something to fix this problem become a vegan put solar panels on your roof dont fly plant a tree etc
  please explain to me exactly how you plan on creating an ai
  thats the why it should work private companies rule own and fuck up everything
  thinks ai will just create itself  dont hold your breath on that one
climate change is going to be a problem but not in our lifetimes or our childrens or their childrens  if we continue at this rate 400 years from now things will be pretty bad but it will be a long and slow decline
  i don care how fat i very cuz in da future i liv foreva  enjoy your heart attack fatty
  very bad world war 3  but that would fix the global warming thing
  become a vegan  not even this much just stop eating so much meat and dairy we would have a lot less of an issue if people would be willing to give up just a little
  stop making these threads
  extremely hecked    only the collapse of civilization prevents runaway climate change but if the heat engine of civilization turns off it heats the earth even faster its a paradoxical predicament were in     the aerosol masking effect/global dimming from coal power plants and airplane contrails is the only thing preventing a sudden jump in temperature that causes massive crop failures  so we have to keep burning dirty coal even though its contributing to the problem
  need to decommission our nuclear power plants first though    human might go extinct in the near future but that wont save the biosphere the meltdowns and radiation will kill off most other lifeforms
  it is already a problem for many people flooding wildfires crap failure its happening now   and its getting really bad quickly   
  but that wont save the biosphere the meltdowns and radiation will kill off most other lifeforms  is it that serious
  blowing up some nuclear plants might even help environment most lifeforms can deal better with radiation then humans but human activity can kill almost all life in an area and turn fertile regions into deserts
  yes its that serious    in a collapse situation where utilities stop functioning you lose the cooling systems in the nuclear plants which require a constantly circulating supply of fresh water    spent fuel rods get exposed to the air and explode     we have 400 nuclear plants around the world it would be a lifeending disaster if this happens at only a fraction of them
  just for human life
  we have 400 nuclear plants around the world it would be a lifeending disaster if this happens at only a fraction of them  lol most meltdowns have zero fatalities
  haha well just kill em amrite magabros fist bump
  need to decommission our nuclear power plants first though   this is already happening
its not just climate change human activity kills all kind of life even insects vanish at an alarming rate
    we need to consider migration
  i am quite comfy in poland
    where do you think all those red countries are going to go when all their food and water runs out genius
  dont worry warmer climate will mean fewer of them will die in the winter well soon be drowning in these little motherfuckers
  six feet under genius
  can even imagine canada and scandinavia being the new breadbaskets of the world it was eisenhower who said the luck of these lands being so fertile is the main source of americas power on the world stage we are completely fucked
  at least youll be losing weight from climate change porky god i fucking hate you
  into the oceans  not willingly of course  they will just need a little bit of lets say persuading
  not gonna happen graph is retarded the current breadbasket in canada regularly goes on fire in the summer north quebec is mostly tundra so the ground is literally solid rock
  solar panels are a meme they probably create more greenhouse gasses mining for the materials than they save
  north quebec is mostly tundra  so is scandinavia thats what climate change is its changing the climate so that tundra becomes temperate thats the whole point
  they are going to either reduce their population or adopt building underground farming or perhaps even asteroid farms
  north quebec is mostly tundra so the ground is literally solid rock  poland already is one of the most fertile regions in the world as is germany and belarus
  asteroid farms
  black people are still working on making sure everyone else recognizes they wuz kangs how are they going to make asteroid farms
  adopt or die        
  its for them to figure it out  although i suppose asian nations might do it first
  that makes sense china is pretty much the slave master for the continent of africa at the moment better the chinese than us wed be called racists if we did what theyre doing anyway
  solar cells are mostly glass and silicon this is made of sand to mine sand you just need a bucket and a shovel transport and melting needs energy but this energy is earned back quite fast a year in alaska two months in sunny california
  why would i need stupid solar cells if we have coal reserves for next 1000 years
  because they are cheaper and less polluting
  actually the opposite is the case insects can survive even very cold winters a milder winter is good for bacteria and mould this is killing insects   and because of this polishappleguy    may have to pollinate apples by hand or learn eat grass
  i dont know im not an expert but please rewatch goremans inconceivable trut all predictions this far are about as valid as flat earth theories global warming changed to climate change and climate change doesnt just manifest as global warming but increasing climate extremes i dont buy it not saying humans cant alter atmosphere dramatically but freons were another case entirely their chemical reactions with ozone could be proven a priori and a posteriori climate change from methane and carbon dioxide has way too many variables in it to make sense out of
  solar and wind energy is cheaper coal plants go out of business because they can not compete
  because coal is going to accelerate the degradation of living standards and the environment while amplifying global warming whereas solar is just a stupid waste of resources that would have a neutral effect on pollution and warming
  all predictions this far are about as valid as flat earth theories  which predictions    global warming changed to climate change and climate change doesnt just manifest as global warming but increasing climate extremes  incorrect     freons were another case entirely their chemical reactions with ozone could be proven a priori and a posteriori climate change from methane and carbon dioxide has way too many variables in it to make sense out of  the greenhouse effect is proven a priori and a posteriori
    coal is super cheap and global warming is good for developed world
  so were not going to get swarmed by mosquitos any time soon good to know
  coal is already too expensive to use actually
  coal is super cheap without climate change taxes
  may have to pollinate apples by hand or learn eat grass  what are nanodrones
  this is also a plot half way through the series of the 100    spoilers its bad
  that looks way to expensive for any republican to get behind   better just make more f35s and reaper drones
  you daft bastard
  and lets crash any type of economy while were at it
  even if you deny the effects of global warming coal is the most harmful source of energy wwwforbescom/sites/jamesconca/2012/06/10/energysdeathprintapricealwayspaid/
  harmful in what way black lives dont matter
  given the track record id prepare for the opposite of whatever the alarmists say
  wind and solar make up 1 of the worlds energy despite all the fuss and subsidies and if anthropogenic impact is bad why is the anthropogenic impact of wind and solar ignored wind literally translates wind energy to electrical energy robbing the environment of its normal flow it creates a pressure difference that effects immediate local temperature and collapses the lungs of birds and bats solar covers the ground that would otherwise receive sunlight and has a heat island effect both alternatives are made from nonrenewable elements if we were reliant on wind and solar and just found coal we would probably be insisting on switching over in order to save the environment
  global warming is good for humans anywhere  limited gains in crop productivity in northern canada and eastern europe and barren wastelands like scandinavia are going to offset making central southern europe and north america incapable of subsisting off domestic staple crops   faggot
  nobody cares about third world time to die
man reading this thread is depressing literally like livestock leading themselves to our own slaughterhouse   cant imagine being a scientist and having to deal with the mental gymnastics/putting head in sanding that people pull off     is antibiotic resistance a serious thing too for the future or is it just fear mongering
  is antibiotic resistance a serious thing too for the future or is it just fear mongering  its a pretty serious thing doctors are pretty retarded for having gone through so many years of school
    the world is heading towards a postantibiotic era in which common infections will once again kill if current trends continue sophisticated interventions like organ transplantation joint replacements cancer chemotherapy and care of preterm infants will become more difficult or even too dangerous to undertake this may even bring the end of modern medicine as we know it    director general of who addressing the united nations on the topic of antibiotic resistance in april 2017/
  if you have seen academia from the inside without wearing rosetinted glasses youll have little faith in our climate scientists    hell ive even published a crappy paper on co2 reduction in a topquartile sustainability journal even though i know co2 is a ruse
    while well intentioned this curve is dishonest because the blue curve has 120yr average while the red and orange curve is annual it makes it seems like the rate of warming is unprecedented see     to compare apples to apples you need to run 120yr average on the red and orange curve as well
in my region it was 18 recently whereas when i was a kid 20 yrs ago it used to be around zero
  but muh co2
  yes youre right and all of that still is less damaging than burning coal you fucking imbecile
  this is why they had to change the name to climate change
assuming we removed the atmosphere could that prevent climate change  im worried that even after total removal industrial processes will produce new atmosphere though so itll probably need to be a continuous process a better alternative might be a very large solar shade to obscure the entire earth and freeze it to near absolute zero and that might be easier than shipping all the atmospheric mass using mass drivers or rockets
there is not any extraordinary climate change going on
  removing the atmosphere would cause much more climate change
  sounds as serious as bird flu and mad cow
  very optimistic   the majority of the heavily industrial nations and other polluting nations realize the threat and start working against it we stay below the 2 degrees mark  optimistic  one part of the biggest polluters in the world will work against the threat that is the climate change major ecological problems do occur but international aid is helping to contain it  neutral  only a small fraction of nations are committed to finding a solution for this problem shortterm profit remains the goal for the world economy major ecological catastrophes will force poorer nations to either adapt to these changes or fail at the test of time humanity as a whole will survive and adapt as well  pessimistic  the projects that are meant to contain the changing climate do fail due to the lack of governmental support shortages of food and water in poorer regions will lead to brutal wars industrialized nations will start isolating themselves since no one really wants to waste resources on ending wars or accepting refugees if you are in the middle of a crisis yourself  humanity will eventually overcome these obstacles and adapt to the new climate but at a great cost  very pessimistic  nobody is able to contain climate change nor is anyone actually interested shortages in food and water will lead to major wars that in turn lead to more refugees which in turn lead to more civil unrest and that will be the cause for more wars we enter a dark age of famine hatred regression and darkness
  so whats this fear mongering about over population and climate change well literally start dropping like flies once again in a few decades
  but the climate will change once and then its pretty much moonlike serenity broken by occasional volcanic activity
  it kills the most people per unit of power produced even in the developed world
  the blue curve has 120yr average  no it doesnt
  there is
  the good people of the carolinas houston new jersey and the caribbean would like a word with you fren
  intentionally deceptive graphs are trustworthy
everyone should be worried about it but heres some solution proposals and if these dont work we all just kill ourselves  1 set off a bunch of nukes in an unpopulated area antarctica for example to cause a nuclear winter just big enough to cancel out the warming  2 move everyone inland as fast as possible hope the coming extreme droughts dont render agriculture impossible  3 everyone become primitivists like the unabomber cut the power lines everyone fights all at once to determine who will be the fittest huntergatherers to populate the new postapocalyptic world  4 build a nuclear pulse propulsion generation ship and send it to the nearest habitable planet to ensure the human species survives as the earth becomes uninhabitable  5 rebuild the amazon rainforest by setting up a perimeter and killing everybody on sight who tries to cut stuff down simultaneously terraform the sahara the co2 would get sucked up by all the trees and shit
  how exactly would that kill everyone i dont think you understand just how fucking huge the earth is there are whole continents without a single nuke plant
  nuclear winter is a myth totally unfounded the firebombing attacks in ww2 put just as much soot in the air and did not cause a cooling event further blocking incoming light doesnt actually solve anything because it reduces crop production just as much as heating does
  very hecked not as hecked as guy mcpherson says we wont be extinct by 2030 but its gonna get bad like millenialong great depression bad
  firebombing attacks in ww2 put just as much soot in the air  as much as what
  as a large number of nukes going off
  wind and solar make up 1 of the worlds energy despite all the fuss and subsidies  power stations are longlived and energy companies are generally conservative as hell and while they make up a small slice of current generation both wind and solar make up a very large fraction of all new electrical generation    and if anthropogenic impact is bad why is the anthropogenic impact of wind and solar ignored  its not both are heavily studied    if we were reliant on wind and solar and just found coal we would probably be insisting on switching over in order to save the environment  thats complete bullshit even ignoring agw the local impacts of coal power on air and water quality are enormous
  were not doing anything to decommission our nuclear plants in the near future but if you conservatively estimate that the majority of them do not melt down catastrophically when the collapse happens due to crop failures perhaps you might still have 50 or 100 nuclear plants spewing ionizing radiation into the atmosphere and oceans and the winds and currents would carry it around the globe look at chernobyl where fallout was deposited hundreds of miles away    for a lot of those nuclear plants there wouldnt be anyone to respond and dump sand on the reactor nothing to contain the damage     ionizing radiation is generally bad for you    
  how is the graph intentionally deceptive
  it isnt real
  wait for jesus to return and rule the ones left alive we should rejoice fore we are the lucky ones youre blind if youre still a nonchristian
  it has to go up in the stratosphere you absolute shitstain  ww2 stuff stayed below 15km in the troposphere
  hecked    exactly how much cum do you gargle on an hourly basis
      holy shit this must be a troll  i thought i was still at /pol/ for a moment
  actually switching to a green economy will save prosperity pollution makes life miserable effects of climate change already hurt the economy wildfires floods drought crop failures etc
  not for me i put all my money in oil stocks
  so sorry for you you should have put your money in renewable energy instead
  not very plenty of time to move over to green energy
  why even do that  for every little bit we do and for every new tech our population continues to swell with filthy low iq fast breeding third worlders  the elites tell us we need them  if we just had less of us then more of us could have a better life with less impact on the planet  there would be enough resources for everyone and more could be put toward advancing as an intelligent species  the best answer is depopulation
    all we need are a couple million mg42s at the borders
  here is picture
  dotting the lands with wind turbines and solar panels is pollution
  its less polluting than other power generators
psychologist taking responses
  this is a science board gtfo
so are 30 of undergrad dropouts
    psyochology    lol the socalled science that begins and ends in mere words
all psychological degrees should have a neuroscience prerequisite    what do you think of that pharmashill
  you think he worked with polanski to take out tate and her friends he had a lot to lose financially if she decided to fuck with him
  not sci  not math  fuck off
why do psychologists ignore the work of wilhelm reich is it autism
i got into linear algebra with matrixes pretty easily but derivations seem to be unreachable along with functions and graphs i had like 2 hours of math a week at middle school and everyone here just assumes i already know half of the things they should be teaching us ive been doing dervations exercises for two weeks now every day and still only got 75 on a test from them that i need to fucking ace     im really starting to wonder whether the degree is actually worth all the trouble should i even bother anymore if derivations are giving me this much trouble and its part of every single thing for the rest of the academic year intergrals in second semester
  no your grammar looks perfect
  what do you not understand about derivations
  matrixes  half of  derivation
  chains rule it doesnt werk for me maybe i should consider suicide since i cant understand simple concepts
oh shit wait until you get into primitives you will give up
  im an esl subhuman    how extremely complicated and deep they can get when you have to use all the fg rules fgf/gf(((gxfx in a single fucking math example or whatever you call it how do you not fuck up something like that
  first you derivate the shell then you multiply it all by the derivative of the core
  that guy wasnt me idk why he even posted here the rule for brackets is pretty simple but when combined with other rules its an absolute clusterfuck
  if you ever make a single mistake about anything youre a brainlet and should give up forever
  can you give an example that you dont get
  3x1/x  this fucked me up for example its super simple you have to do two easy steps its just ax rule i thought i was supposed to do something complicated with the x1/x part but nope     and then you have really complicated shit like sinx/cosx    good luck derivating that without a single mistake
  it was me fucking around as always so i will try to make it up to you    do you understand the formal definition of the derivative at all i recommend to you to start understanding the formula from pic related if you still cannot get it then start with limits because derivatives is just a limit between two points in a curve     good luck anon
  yeah trigonometric stuff can be really vicious
  to remember the quotient rule i remember  d/dx highx/lowx       high minus high   d d  low low     low  low    its a mountain and to get up you just chant to summon cthulhu  low d high  high d low all over low times low    deriving trig functions are easy if you just slow down and think about them integrating them is the difficult part
fucking killed my spacing      to remember the quotient rule i remember  d/dx highx/lowx       high minus high    d  d   low low     low  low     its a mountain and to get up you just chant to summon cthulhu  low d high  high d low all over low times low    deriving trig functions are easy if you just slow down and think about them integrating them is the difficult part
you got maple and wolfram alpha to solve your triple integrals pdes and multivariate garbage real math has nothing to do with that brainletneer plebshit busywork anyways so dont sweat it
  real math has nothing to do with that brainletneer plebshit busywork anyways so dont sweat it  thats what pisses me off im studying logistics im acing the subjects that i need to know and are connected to what i study math on this school exists just to filter out retards look i get it there are people here that absolutely shouldnt be here and they need to get rid of them but apparently every other person fails math every year first semester
  all the schools outside us teach those things in early middle school you really are a brainlet
  only matrixes is wrong
  no they dont not here in eastern europe i know ive seen some basic function graphs in like second grade and thats it ive never even seen derivations before in my life highschools here are very specialized you have gymnasiums that get math like 6 times a week and they know this shit then you have vocational schools that focus on a certain part of industry like mine and you get some extremely basic shit only
  stop replying to obvious shitposting
  wait so youre saying youre still struggling with calc 101 when youre in la calc 3 multivariable is usually prerequisite for linear at the colleges ive been to so how did you survive those    anyway get a calculator that can do derivatives not so you can cheat and be lazy but to check yourself after youve already tried dont give up
and anyway i recommend the mit lectures on linear algebra in any case i doubt if you master linear and still fuck up derivatives you can still pass the class unless your prof is just super strict
  /sci/ in a nutshell
do you respect doctors
  no med school is only hard on account of how much rote memorization you need to do theres absolutely nothing intellectually challenging involved yet they still think theyre geniuses because they stay at the library till 10pm
  this most medfags are brainlet npcs
  i hate this lucky chad he isnt even that smart he gives off normie brainlet vibes 115 iq max
  yet we save your worthless lives you need us faggot and only the smartest can get accepted to med school
  depends if they come from a family of doctors if so then absolutely not
  its the sad truth
  lucky he worked hard for place in life maybe you should too instead of thinking youre smart and excepting things to happen to you
  i am also working hard i will do big things
  he is insanely lucky genetically speaking also hard work is a meme everyone works hard
  good i hope you do anon
  brainlet npc  being hardworking means being an npc  doing drugs and skipping school is patrician  
  everyone works hard  not sure if sarcastic or actually retarded
  yet we save your worthless lives    only because you hold access to the licensed medicine like the crony capitalists you secretly are     let me buy my own pills i can diagnose myself just fine
  i can diagnose myself just fine  im not even a medfag but thats retarded
  thats literally the case     i diagnosed my own borreliosis while the doc seriously doubted glad i went to another one to get prescription for antibiotics    i can read the same scientific journals and grab the same books you read
    doctors have to be people oriented so they are extremely normie
  only the smartest get accepted into medical school
  but the scientific journals and books were written by scientists and physicians themselves the world needs doctors anon
    unironically i left a top 25 us medical school after two years before clinical to attend law school for somewhat these reasons obviously i can elaborate adnauseum did a thesis  they awarded me an ms so it wasnt entirely worthless i fell for the med school  smart meme even after all my volunteer work research experience etc in the application process it took those two years to realize  insanely low pay for the amount of work  even doctors with insane amounts of experience in a toptier field and institution make mediocre money for the time invested the disparity is only going to increase as medicine becomes more socialized  its a high end trade job  9999 of the time you see a patient for 5 minutes immediately know the problem and write a script the end a few residencies differ slightly emergency is a bit less redundant i guess but for the most part that is all it is  it becomes your entire life  no surprises no entertainment no larger aspirations  primarily because the time needed to contribute there is a reason you dont see almost any politicians/leaders of industry with mds and those that have one usually didnt spend long practicing medicine ie they skip residency and go right into politics  lots of rote memorization and jumping through hoops  intelligent i definitely met a few brilliant people in my med school but a much larger percentage were people who spent all day/everyday studying officehour lingerers and diversity/affirmative action students unironically the cs and engineering students i knew in undergrad has much more creativity intuition and problem solving ability than almost all of my med school class      this is the kind of stuff i told myself for a long time it kept me going until i came around to accepting the hard truth
  opinions on medics    physicists yeah you guys are aight     chemists a necessary evil     biologists we made you come back to daddy     mathematician   i do hope my grandchildren are alright
  i do but im a med student so no surprise i gotta ask those who dont why do you take into account only intelligence dedication sympathy compassion sacrifice and doing things they way they have to be done deserve respect too guy in ops pic is a do not a md btw
  you guys are aight    why are physicists such chads
i only respect surgeons that shit takes serious guts
  do you know there have been civilian surgeons
    its a pun   its a pun on taking peoples guts out   hahahahhhahahahhahahahahah  aaaaaaaaaah aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
  the world needs knowledge without the attached social acceptance common practices financial restrictions insurance policies common good public opinions medical hierarchies electronic data records racial policies national biases etc that many doctors introduce because they operate as a business and need to make money not cure people
  heres your you    
  doctors are car mechanics without the expectation of actually fixing anything
  im the person who wrote that comment that wasnt intentional but thanks for the laugh
i would if they werent so insecure just look at the face they make when you ask for a second opinion i swear most people who become physicians only do it to get over their own uselessness case in point 
sure but medicine is far too complex for any one person so their advice may be of limited usefullness in whatever ailment you have
  as a med student only so far as it takes for me to get a good evaluations for my grade     otherwise being in med school has lowered my opinions of doctors
  insanely low pay for the amount of work  even doctors with insane amounts of experience in a toptier field and institution make mediocre money for the time invested the disparity is only going to increase as medicine becomes more socialized    this is entirely dependent on the individual and their specialty i know pmr docs pulling in 500k a year working only 3 days a week works zero oncall and over 8 weeks of blocked out vacation time a year i also know plenty of radiologist only working 34 days a week with 12 weeks of vacation a year pull over 300k a year i also know retarded family med docs that work 60hour work week and only make 250k a year i definitely agree with everything else you said though
  otherwise being in med school has lowered my opinions of doctors  why lots of dummies
the derms i met were very smart takes some thickskinned people to make it in that specialty
  its a lot of things usually intelligence isnt the big one that bothers me though there are definitely some dummies in my class most medical stuff is a matter of following treatment algorithms laid out by each specialties organization    the biggest problem ive had is a lot of my attendings acting like the biggest entitled brats ever they treat their support staff like shit they get so angry if support staff does something wrong but take no responsibility as the healthcare team leader to properly instruct the staff in terms of what they want done shit drives me up the fucking walls you cant just go around treating people like shit for doing something wrong if youre not going to teach it to them properly    that being said ive also worked with awesome doctors who are chill as fuck so they dont make a hostile workplace even if their support staff fucks up or are really good about teaching their support staff so the support staff doesnt fuck up    pretty much a ton of personality flaws that get amplified by the fact that theyre the center of attention and are catered to by a bunch of support staff
  dermatologists are the 1 of medical students avg step 1 for that residency is like 995th percentile they get rewarded real nice in terms of work/life balance for it too
  doctors  no theyre brainlets and shouldnt even be called doctor since they dont have phds
  yet we save your worthless lives you need us faggot  go ahead let me die i dont care i want to kill myself half the time anyways  and only the smartest can get accepted to med school  i lold so hard i need medical attention
  daily reminder not to be an organ donor because it makes you more likely to get negligent care especially if youre a visible minority
  diversity/affirmative action students    how much of a problem is this i never went into medicine but really felt for premeds because of the urm crap and people school admins and other mindless kissasses go to great lengths and mental gymnastics to prove its a good thing to admit these people    the other day i was treated by a black nurse practitioner probably a simple diagnosis and treatment but cant help feeling a little uneasy
   low pay  s a high end trade job  sounds about right       its brainlet work a white nurse is also likely to fuck up
i dont randomly respect entire groups of people i respect individuals who have earned my respect
  do you respect doctors    nothing better than having a medical doctor humbled by needing to stick his finger up my ass to check my prostate
  not if they browse 4channel  such a crazy faggot couldnt be trusted to heal me
  calling it 4channel    you are a traitor and will be hanged on the day of the rope
  accurate based medfags take the shitty jobs so we dont have too
  as a med student i needed this thread  you guys rock
  not really there are some good ones but most of them dont really give a shit and just throw pills at you and hope they work
  i dont respect the (((doctor))) that cut my foreskin off
  the assumption that institutions lower their standards to admit people of color is racist as fuck all they do is look at the pool of qualified applicants separate the minorities and then make sure they take a certain number of those as well to think that institutions must lower their standards if theyre letting blacks in requires the assumption that blacks are inherently inferior which is /pol/ tier nonsense and not fit for intelligent discussion    whether the current practice of separating by color and requiring a certain number of that color is a good idea is another matter i wouldnt say anyone is racist for thinking that race shouldnt play a role in the application process
  until i started working with them
  im at a top 20 usmd we have very few black kids in our class and theyre all pretty smart   they also all come from incredibly wealthy families and were sent to the very best prep schools   these individuals frequently beat the drum on social media and in social settings about diversity but i honestly doubt theyll go back to serve underprivileged communities    we need a martial plan for the internal us we need to stamp out like 90 of the less productive cultures in our borders including alt right bullshit like on a lot of 4chan reeducate people even if it means taking them away from their parents and reprioritize productivity and intelligence this means taking a lot of music off the radio shows off the tv books off the shelves we need a cultural reset
  to think that institutions must lower their standards if theyre letting blacks in requires the assumption that blacks are inherently inferior which is /pol/ tier nonsense and not fit for intelligent discussion  what causes the sat racial gap if not racial differences in iq     i already regret replying to you since the sentence i quoted is enough for me to recognize you as the lowly liberal mediocre yesman you are
  no    overrated glorified nurses that kill people but get away with that    mds suck at math  rely on route memorisation
  itt nobody understands what a doctor actually does as their job
  i have experienced nothing but bad experiences shitty diagnoses shittier medications and the shittiest of attitudes from doctors i have absolutely no respect for their profession
  gets paid by drug companies
        are us citizens who study abroad at a disadvantage for residency placement compared to us citizens who go to med schools here im a high school senior whos considering doing an mbbs abroad to save myself 4 years of debtfilled schooling as a premed
  i wish
  how
  this person is an organ donor therefore if i let this person die i can use their organs to save several other people
  insanely low pay for the amount of work    maybe in the us but in canada my dad makes 600000 a year as a gp and only works 96 and a couple weekends per month if you specialize you can make double that for half the work
  honestly it benefits white people to not have merit based system based purely on grades if entrance was just based on gpa/mcat 80 of people in us med schools would be asians by letting in 23 urms into a class of 100 you can prevent most of the class being asian
    tfw your job is so useless that it can be effectively replaced by a website
  if it makes you feel better he went to do school so he is guaranteed to be a 90 iq brainlet
definitely not as a group not only is there a lot of money involved ive actually had useless antibiotics pushed on me literally for only profit  so obviously i dont trust them  i dont respect people i cant trust
  i get to die with my conscience clear and be useful to someone  good deal
  i used to but then i had a slightly complicated illness that took 6 years to get resolved because nowadays doctors have 0 creativity or curiosity theyre all just automatons most of them just want to push ssris or opioids on you and collect their copay    i used to have very positive experiences with every type of doctor but i think recent tech integration has lobotomized most of them
  intelligence doesnt matter and if you think it does youre a jealous brainlet what matters is your attitude how hard youre willing to work and how well you can communicate to other people after those it comes how you look and then follows intelligence if you werent willing to spend 10 hours a day studying for a decade just to end up in a job with 14 hour shifts where you have to sit down with a person and tell them that their significant other just died your skillset and character are already inferior to a medics  bbut i can do math that no doctor can do  i can work teaching in a high school and making 20 of the money doctors do  top kek
  you cant be this retarded
  significant other    go back
  the one who spaces his lines of text is telling other to go back  project harder asshole
    after seeing the absolute state of premeds in undergrad i cant respect any of them theyre all degenerate normies with zero problem solving skills taking watered down memorization based versions of the curricula real stem majors go through and thinking it makes them smart
  that sounds like being a chef except at the end you sit down with a person and tell them that even though their mother/brother/other has died theyre still expected to be at work
  yes a rheumatologist that successfully diagnosed what i had when i was smol is the reason i can eat and shitpost by myself
does anyone know the answer to  
  hard work beats talent when talent dont work hard ya heard
    yes significantly youll have a hard time placing anywhere that isnt obgyn/peds/fm/im
  if you grew up in the inner city with no one who gives a shit about you and no money youd have shit sat scores too anon    lowly liberal mediocre yesman you are  back to /pol/ with you
  no med school is trauma programming to drill in do what youre told or malpractice complete with sleep deprivation overwork debt and so on    doctors are created to serve the machine not their patients if they try to do otherwise the system either forces them out or buries them in administrative overhead and paperwork such that they either cant run a private practice or cant get anything done ie what they did to naturopaths who themselves often have a lot to learn a lot of people assume nds are max redpill but alternative doesnt mean 100 correct just because the mainstream is retarded
  based thinking
  ive noticed that 95 of them are bio majors they truly are brainlets whos only skill is being able to sit down for 9 hours and rote memorize tons of useless information using quizlet
  naturopaths are just con artists   trick stupid people into giving them money easy work
  is this because students who study abroad are dumber on average or does the system explicitly favor students who pay their dues via that sweet sweet med school debt
  sure
  this if youve ever spoken to someone from japan or korea you will see that they arent the highest scoring countries on pisa tests because of muh iq they score high because literally all they do is go to school and study day and night meanwhile the average american kid goes to school and then comes home and plays fortnight
  bio major / premed even if they took a bio major the course work is not the same at all
  its a bit of both its also a connections thing more program directors have more exposure to certain schools students etc etc and tend to know what theyre working with vs an international school where they rarely see anyone from that school
  naturopaths  often have much to learn  often  nibber the entire field is complete snake oil ponzi scheme where the universities that teach the bullshit separate retards from their money teaching them acupuncture and homeopathy who then go on to separate other retards from their money with useless treatments and medical weed cards
  be consistent brightest kid in class from childhood through undergrad  socially competent and fit play sports competitively through hs and college  self confident and loved by parents  take challenging courses excel past expectations  memorize pretty big amounts of information  volunteer with underserved try to learn about what holds them back from improving and excited to work on it  take mcat get high percentile  apply write essays about my life interview get accepted several places  go to medical school  medical school is full of a specific type of kid you remember from high school maybe college  generally unfit and unattractive cluster in little groups of a few guys orbiting a few girls  whole identities built around academic perfectionism  try to connect with them and they do not accept you  make a few friends with fellow outsiders  school prides itself on early and often clinical experience  early in medical school present for a few deaths after emts drop off really bad cases from multicar pileup   struggle to understand wtf we were meant to do in that situation  all doctors are cynical as fuck or completely tuned out  imagine your attending will talk to you about literally anything other then the job theyre meant to be helping you learn   year 4 havent had a casual conversation with anyone in class for years  fellow outsiders all meet up very rarely we just all seem to be struggling  not sleeping very much  doing the work that nurses would do if they werent somehow always on break paying to do it  feeling fucked up because it must be a personal failure that lead to my alienation from every one of my colleagues and the system itself  feel stupid all the time due to not knowing what i need to to help anyone  sure am good at taking multiple choice tests dropping class signals to get attendings to like me and disimpacting bowels though     yeah if i didnt have my wife and a kid to support i would probably just jump off a bridge
  le snake oil  okay fishbein    ive had bad experiences with both of them but naturopaths do tend to get closer to fixing core causes now days i dont like anyone and wont have anything to do with medical anything beyond acute trauma related stuff if stitches or staples would be required broken bones etc
  fucking fascist kids these days have better writing skills than most adults older than 60 theyre more empathetic and sophisticated they arent entertained by lol gays lol blacks they work harder in school the past fucking sucks our society has never been better
    naturopathy is obvious bullshit and you have to be the messiah of retards to actually believe it
  have you ever been to a naturopath  have you ever had acupuncture
  fishbein did nothing wrong
  theyre more empathetic and sophisticated  kids right now all have brain damage and its steadily getting worse theory of mind and empathy have never been worse
  do i have to jump off a building to know i cant fly        fischbein  i dare you to post it without the space
    daily reminder that the opposite of x always works is only x never works if youre retarded
  tell yourself that when you get cancer and you let them put you through their system      not seeing any actual substance
  talent  talent doesnt exists its a thing that brainlets use to rationalize their failures or to dream about making it big with no effort talent is when preparation meets opportunity the guy that has talent to play the piano always has been playing it for 30 years
  youre dumb
  more excuses    the answer is no you havent youre just parroting what youve heard in accordance with the narrative of the subcultures you traverse most frequently and identify with
  im thinking you need to quit youre still young medicine is not for you anon do it for your wife and kid do it for yourself quit
  because naturopathy has no substance lmao  
surgeons are the only respectable doctors thank u next
  you shoudve went into law or finance aka the careers that most chads go into medicine is usually just pajeets changs and white incels
  i appreciate this advice but i cant start from zero anywhere else   i can make it a few more years
  neither naturopath i went to ever mentioned homeopathy    next
  are surgeons the engineers of medicine
  fascism is unironically the best political system
  bbut reddit said
  damn anon im like you but more of a failure
  independent thought isnt brain damage
  teach yourself programming and computer science and apply that to medicine somehow the possibilities are endless brainlet bootcamp code monkeys are getting jobs within a few months now dont waste any more of your time doing something you dread get out
  telling him to quit when hes already 300k in debt
  theyre engineers artists and above all superheroes
  its not independent there are just so many layers of media and propaganda that any given subset can at first have the illusion of being independent and freethinking in reality theyre riddled with groupthink virtue signalling and dogma    groups are worthless if they cant mobilize and act change their direction or display dynamic behavior as more information is available
  300k debt vs 300k debt  being miserable for the rest of your life
  uhm sweaty the only reason you can save peoples lives is because scientists discovered a way to save people lives anyway most lives are worthless in the way and just consume resources
  implying i would listen to a worthless human
  muh progress  muh happy to be enslaved
  well now you know you made a good decision not forcing something to work
  i will look into it thank you
  why is consuming resources bad its in our nature to consume shit earth is our ho
  i want to get on my knees and suck his dick until it falls out then ill put it on a skillet season it and cook it for breakfast
  huh
  some substantial portion of our finite resources is being used to keep shitposters alive  why is this bad
  honestly there has to be some level of talent even though the greats all work harder than anyone personally ive found that any musical task came very naturally to me and i never had to practice as much as other people i know to get the same results theres always a barrier to talent though where if you want to be really good the only thing you can do is practice that work ethic is why no one knows who the fuck i am but buckethead made it on guitar hero
  the end goal of everything we do is to chill and shitpost
  most doctors are like your typical lube and tire shop in town run by that one italian or irish family whos been there for ages they didnt make the car and they only understand enough to fix the most common problems else they get a replacement part actual medical studies are essentially very large amounts of information about the actual combined biological processes in the human body contrasted with known process in vitro for a specific type of foreign or internal influence i respect the guys busting ass doing research and trying to understand/affect different mechanisms in diseases or ailments
when i become an attending ill be smug as shit and will constantly bully my students
  good for you
  yes especially that hot man 3 _ 3
should i become a medical technician
  somewhat but also theyre do the same usmle exams yet still find it harder to match only the elite of the elite fmgs get into good specialties
all of you complaining about affirmative action never cry when most people in med get in through connections so many of my classmates are filthy rich or have daddy as a medical director
  i challenge you to do so much rote memorization and finish med school but its a silly argument since you cannot enter
nothing that requires schooling is respectable going to school is the most normal uninteresting least respectable thing a person can do
  7/10 bait
  refugee  his parents died from cancer    yeah he sure is lucky
  cant wait for ai to replace them
  ai will replace every other field before it touches medicine
  nonsense  neither the imaging technology nor sufficiently advanced human body models are far off
  cope whilst doctors make 500000 starting
  doctors pay off their college debt within 1 year  lol
  yes they are raking in money   more reasons to get rid of them damn kikes
  no right up until i break my fucking leg    then yes
  people who blame the 01 of blacks/mexicans who get in through affirmative action are brainlets most spots at top universities are taken by rich peoples kids even if they are stupid like george bush who got into yale with a 25 gpa     harvards incoming class of 2021 is made up of over 29 percent legacy students reports the harvard crimson last years applicants who had harvard in their blood were three times more likely to get into the school than those without    the case is the same at stanford in fact across the top 30 schools in the us one review from 2011 discussed in the washington post found that children of alumni had a 45 percent greater chance of admission than other applicants
  only people who know nothing about medicine respect doctors
  enlighten us
  lol noskin
  reward the brightest students by giving them the jobs that require the least skill and intelligence  goddammit
  why would you say that
  back to rddit they are referred to as normalfags here
  hhahaahaha you have no foreskin hhaahahaha
  i have a foreskin
  what matters is your attitude how hard youre willing to work and how well you can communicate to other people a      class a npc bullshit  maybe your communication skills will stop viruses spreading or bacteria mutation
  optimized
  to think that institutions must lower their standards if theyre letting blacks in requires the assumption that blacks are inherently inferior which is /pol/ tier nonsense and not fit for intelligent discussion    not fit for intelligent discussion iq tests have literally proven blacks are intellectually inferior to whites and asians but even with the facts results of testing and thousands of years of evidence it is still open discussion for all except those who have an active interest in keep certain uncomfortable truths hidden youre either an insecure black or an sjw either way youre in no position to be telling people what they can and cannot discuss    the truth does not fear investigation
  apart from surgeons surgeons are pretty cool they need to be able to think quickly solve problems know the human body like the back of their hand etc    ive struggled with my health for years and have very little respect for gps though theyre not just stupid theyre arrogant and asking them any kind of medical questions results in them asking if youve been using google and advising you not to believe the internet its not like they bother sharing any information
  this country has a lot to answer for and if it isnt publicly acknowledged and apologized for via that acknowledgement these many festering sores will continue to bring this hell to crumble
im a highschool senior looking to become a cardiothoracic surgeon or a osteosurgeon in the future is surgery the best way to specialize after an md i mean it seems to me once you grind through that residency its easy money and youre the attending you make mad stacks and work from 96 and become the boss
  im also fairly smart and creative 99th percentile in standardized testing and i love art / creativity i draw and do graphic design idk what else i would do to specialize after getting an md besides surgery
  coming to 4channel for this question is an actual mistake but im going to give you some advice here and if you keep it you will be ok  dont worry about what type of doctor you want to be some day thats so far outside of the scope of what you should give a shit about as a high school student   right now focus on getting good grades exercising a ton cardio and lifting and slamming puss   next will come college where the exercise and the puss slamming should contribute to a good time do well in college get an a in ochem volunteer shadow a few years into college you can begin to think about whether or not you will be admitted to medical school let alone what type of doctor you will be   lets say you put together a decent application and get accepted to a medical school only then would it be appropriate to talk or think about what kind of surgeon you want to be because youll join interest groups and get involved in research related to that field     but there is nothing cringier then a high schooler or an undergrad with overly developed medical career goals just say something like id like to become a doctor
  those surgeons are the elite of the elite you must understand      surgery is fun as hell and yes the pay is great dont go into medicine for money alone the grind isnt like anything can imagine go do undergrad first bucko
  well said friend highschool and finishing medschool is like 8 years a decade you change a lot
    thanks for the insight boys ill keep it in mind i may become a physicist instead as well i really love physics ive taken ap physics 1 excelled in both semesters and im in ap physics c mechanics rn
  they might not lower their standards generally but lets say one year the pool of minority students are inferior to the pool of non minorities well if there are a finite number of slots available then that guarantees that some of those slots go to inferior choices which causes them to lower their standards if there standards require them to pick the best just so they can have some minority students now lets reverse that the non minority group is inferior one year so they pick more minority students issue with this is that as far as i know there are no similar protections for non minority groups so its inherently biased and unfair
  try   i work making less but am much less stressed because i didnt settle for a bullshit degree that wastes my only life shacking me to a group of dumbfucks
  the amount of dumb shit i see from doctors on a daily basis is ridiculous mostly its from ones who graduated 20 years ago since you could be dumber and go to med school back then
its pretty fucked up that you can get into med school with a totally unrelated undergrad degree like english or some shit what that tells me is that you can come into it with basically 0 medical knowledge and still graduate in 4 years so its basically just another undergrad degree in my phd program anytime we got somebody come in with an even slightly unrelated undergrad degree they had no fucking clue what they were doing and dropped out
  basically 0 medical knowledge  hi what is the mcat
    most of this is just gen eds that virtually every stem major takes in their first two years
  the assumption that institutions lower their standards to admit people of color is racist as fuck  and yet its true funny how that works out
  smartest    the combination of smart and practical  smartest pure intelligence has to go to the mathematician or the scientist
  all blacks are poor and need preferences  all whites arent poor and dont need preferences  if you actually a shit about economic upbringing the preference would be for that
  i hate that i must despise them its all so fucked up
  yes specially when they do anime reviews or dr house reviews    
  surgical technician here who went to university later in life and continued working as a surgical tech part time while going to school i am also doing it now after i graduated as a way to pay the bills before applying to grad school i would say its 50/50 there are many doctors that i respect and are very bright there are also many doctors who would not have their position if it werent for daddys money i literally met doctors that drew their first paycheck ever when when they became a doctor in their mid to late 20s overall i dont think they are as special as they seem to think and believe me they do think they are special nor are they the geniuses that society makes them out to be i took a few classes that premeds take and they werent too difficult very political but not difficult i believe a majority of their prestige ultimately stems from holding a monopoly on practicing medicine and limiting people able to enter the field

congratulations now every moron that said carlsen is not the greatest chess player in history can burn in fucking hell truth is told and he were the best even before the tournament morons you should be deleted from being worthy to fucking breathing this feels so fucking good to say hope you idiots are fucking butthurt now you cannot be fucking more losers true genius you see there a line and you are oposite of that you steal my breath i dont hate that many but people who actually say such stupid are peasants you are not worthy god should punish you you only deserve darwins award and karma i hate haters shit people just had to say that i could say more but i guess most people take the message cheers have a fucking good day
why is every chess player fucking white pisses me off
  no it doesnt but nice low key rhetorical /pol/ question
  imagine if he put that brilliant mind to use doing something thats actually useful to society
guy wins board game match  wow its fucking nothing  
  yeah indeed one could imagine dunno how the guy did at school but he has like zero education and were almost always away from school to play chess but one could imagine like how would he do math and science maybe he turns into a scientist one day he is sort of a sherlock holmes or over there
  but thats not true you fucking imbecile
  you know how many variables they fucks with insanely much they put the human brain into hyperdrive almost even with one piece left ur dumb
  so i dont care  this is not the board for board games
  so this is how chess hooligans look like
  maybe im sure hes capable of it his iq is supposedly fucking 190 so far beyond genius that i can scarcely imagine how his thought process works    i also know that einstein played chess but ive heard it said that he disliked the competitive aspect as he felt it robbed the world of highly intelligent people that would have otherwise been scientists of mathematicians
why does he look inbred
  the guys literally a fucking model what the fuck do you mean he looks inbred are you sure you have a solid grasp of what that word means
  einstein said alot of fucks you can take back home and keep it there so no one knows it because its no good imo everyone needs brain stimulus to even compete with average people and chess fucking push you there so you could say you get even smarter by playing and playing chess on 3k rating is pretty badass that beats computers even todays standard computers have 3500 rating to 4000 now means chess can never be played perfect kasparov has an iq of 180 so carlsen could be a super genius or just super talented one of two but hes at least a happy foe hell get that what an positive guy
  t carlsen   calm the fuck down bro
whats the deal  i dont get it  computers are superior at chess when compared to humans so why is it even intersting some dude wasted his time playing a game
  are you one of those retards who thinks that chess is solved game    kill yourself
  hes clearly not as strong as he once was he nearly lost game 6 and he chickened out in game 12 he knew he was evenly matched at classical so he decided to use the rapid tiebreaks to his advantage carlson from 5 years ago would have won without the tiebreak
  pretty much yeah  i mean the best ai is going to win every time against humans  so all that remains is to improve the ai at this point
  his performance iq is off the charts at the very least can memorize 3 boards and play extremely good chess on them simultaneously and if performance iq is gloaded then hes probably pretty high in other areas too
  is it 190 iq worth of memory really  i mean von neumann could supposedly compute division of two 8 digit numbers in his head at age 6 and his iq is estimated to be 190    i obviously dont know enough as i should about iq and how it is calculated so its a legitimate question
  typical engine babby if any of the old greats were training with engines half as much as he would he not even be top10
  t carlesen
  bullshit you dont know shit go kill urself moron
  nope lol his face is pretty fucked up and he even talks weird and not just because hes norwegian
  see      i cant wait till some idiot savant comes along who just bruteforce memorizes computer lines and btfos carlsen
caruana can think deeper carlsen is faster but less precise and cannot delve as deeply into a line as caruana can with the old classical format caruana would have eventually won
  while theres some truth to that carlsen would have went for different approachpreparation if the format was different obviously   and even like this he had game1 slip and had decent lead in game12 which he would most certainly attack if it werent for rapids
  
      kasparov has an iq of 180 so carlsen could be a super genius or just super talented  found the brainlet here  dont believe what internet tells you the 190 iq kasparov is a hoax in truth he took an iq test when he was younger and scored 135  also carlsen never took an iq test    also you dont need to have a super high iq to be good at chess you just need to start young   a good chess player isnt necessarily an extremely smart person just a good chess player thats what every chess player would tell you actually unlike what brainlet normies think
  wanted to quote this motherfucker here too  
  shame about the downs face though
  he has an incredibly punchable face
  nah theyre jews
  how is this related in any way related to the philosophy of science or math
  hahhahahaahaahaahha you got a little dick fuck ur mom
me move pieces on checkered board me smart  dooohhhh
  wow you are very mad
i just passed calculus on my first try with 8 i really dont see why some anons struggle to even pass
  with 8 what anon
  with 8
  be yüng  math is new and exciting  do ok at it   grow up a little bit math instruction becomes more complicated  dont study or care because youre 8 years old  get that one ridiculously low grade  wtf i need to study for this i need to practice bullshit  im not good at this part of math  grow up more math is even more complicated hate math   i am not a math person  avoid it at all costs  coast through school missing the foundations  hit calc in college and totally flounder because you cant do basic operations  this is how it goes for a lot of people
    yeah when i started ee i was amazed that some people couldnt do highschool stuff like use the chain rule or solve a first order diffy of course all these people failed calc 1
8  hard worker btfo   how will they recover from this 
  im actually better at calc ii than i now my professor for i was shit and i learned absolutely nothing i got a b in calc ii from busting my ass though
being content with merely passing a class  never gonna make it
i mean calc 1 and 2 are just another algebra class but 80 isnt particularly good t math boy
  8 repeats thats what      and its those people who need the wake up call i especially dont understand how some engineering students are not only bad at basic calc but revel in each others mediocrity is our education system really worth saving at this point
  what do you suggest for someone in that situation anon   asides from the final solution ofc 
  precalc by stewart the book is extremely long and has enough filler content to top a dump truck like all stewart books but it covers everything you need to know
        i meant with 8/10 final average grade
  why are you bragging about a b
  i wasnt bragging i just said that calculus isnt that hard to pass
imagine not passing fucking calculus1 with a score of at least 95
  i took pre algebra in college and ended up with an a in calc 1 during my first attempt   most things arent hard to pass   sometimes you just have to study a bit more than the other guy   sometimes a bit less  you made a whole thread to post about your b   congrats i guess anon
  you made a whole thread to post about your b   congrats i guess anon    jesus christ why i would want to brag about it most people have told me is a difficult course yet in reality it was the opposite i consider myself brainlet so for me to score a b confuses me why other students cant even pass
  how are you confused  some people have a hard time in college   some people have difficulty in mathematics   poor backgrounds with maths poor study habits etc   anon this is obvious stuff i assume you know basic psychosocial phenomena   if my assumption is true then what would be your reasoning other than to make a thread   im not attacking you or anything im happy for u anon u did well we love you ganbatte 
tfw struggled with trig  never going to make it  will technology ever deliver me from mediocrity
  i got 90 a or b in my uni i ranked 14th among about 1200 stem fags    i struggled though i did effort it wasnt so easy studied hard many hours every week to achieve it    im not a genius definitely there are many people smarter than me
  this is me except i was 16 when it happened    help im fucking up at calc 1
  8/10  it isnt hard to pass  well it clearly was for you
can someone rec a good book for studying neuroscience
affective neuropscience by panskeep is a good round start   master and his emisary is also pretty dope both are somewhat entry level  you might also wanna go into journals if you are looking for a more specific field of study
  i see thank you very much 
just going through cognitive neuroscience the biology of mind by gazzaniga in preparation for my upcoming masters i would say it is a good general overview the programme has it listed as recommended reading before start
  just checked what they have for pure neuroscience its  kandel e  schwartz j 2013 principles of neural science   purves d 2012 neuroscience
why did science and technology in japan plateau
  japan is competitive in some regards but sometimes their quirky social structure limits individualism and achievement in business settings  i think thats why south korea is heavily outpacing its neighbors china is competitive because they steal shit
  china is competitive because they steal shit  america steals the best and brightest from all over the world turnabout is fair play also china has gmo babbies america doesnt checkmate
  because they didnt have the same level of corporate diversity that the west has
why did it plateau worldwide    the fuck kind of weeb are you to think japan is special

   flip phones are common left smartphones to samsung   atm closes at night and many places only accept cash   cd and dvd still widespread no good streaming services   no heating in apartments very cold in winter   wifi hard to find in public   some people do not even have email addresses  i guess its fine if you like the nostalgic feel of low tech and living 20 years ago
  scientific progress is linked with social and cultural progress and if the latter is halted by caveman conservatism science suffers as well  they might learn in the coming years but the gap theyve built will take a while to close
  no heating  you mean 500 years ago
  quirky social structure limits individualism   collectivist culture that spurns innovation
  salaryman culture makes workforce depressed and overworked
  rampant misogyny
  failing birth rates
  it seems like they decided they achieved a good society that doesnt need the disruption and inevitable alienation of relentless mindless technological growth can you really argue with that
  atm close on weekends so bank tellers still have jobs   atm closes at night and many places only accept cash  
      
  what happened in 1966
  i wonder if city bank is present in japan cause you know the city never sleeps
  
  doesnt matter if there are 1000 atms per person if they close at 5pm
      acting like japan isnt some repressed sexually defunct society where lonely men pay to cuddle with 3d women or fetishize prepubescent schoolgirls getting groped
  note also that japan is only around 2 foreignborn while for most european countries and the united states is around 15 in canada australia and others even higher
  they close at 5pm  they dont see
  also      
  no good streaming services
  no heating in apartments very cold in winter  doubt it
  because of this  
  wifi hard to find in public  anon but thats a good thing see
  high population density
  
  kikeland  protestant europe  kikey propaganda spotted want to separate themselves from other sandniggs when they are ones
the rejection of the latest technology especially smartphones and western apps and services on these phones is the only reason japanese culture and identity is still alive  sooner or later they will give in because of the promised efficiency and comfort and the great nippon empire will be swallowed by the global religion of technological advancement  also read jacques ellul faggots
  this statistic is some western ngo bullshit    most people in bulgaria live in large buildings with centralized district heating built during the socialist era that costs next to nothing per household
  some western ngo bullshit  the data comes from the european union statistics on income and living conditions  eusilc is an instrument aiming at collecting timely and comparable crosssectional and longitudinal multidimensional microdata on income poverty social exclusion and living conditions this instrument is anchored in the european statistical system ess  the eusilc instrument provides two types of data  sectional data pertaining to a given time or a certain time period with variables on income poverty social exclusion and other living conditions   data pertaining to individuallevel changes over time observed periodically over a fouryear period  social exclusion and housing condition information is collected mainly at household level while labour education and health information is obtained for persons aged 16 and over the core of the instrument income at very detailed component level is mainly collected at personal level      
  not that anon hes misunderstanding how it works   when i lived in asia there wasnt central heating most people just had portable heaters in their houses and window units

    isnt the overwork perception a result of overtime and concentration of hours into short periods to give a simplified example of what i mean four hours a day for 5 days vs 20 hours in a single day its the same amount of hours but its distribution is what influences the impact it has on workers
  isnt the overwork perception a result of overtime and concentration of hours into short periods  no it comes from the fact that it was true see the first graph
  too many anime waifus and playstation games to distract wouldbe scientists
  people in japan spend way less time playing videogames compared to the rest of the world
   guess its fine if you like the nostalgic feel of low tech and living 20 years ago  not wanting less botnet    japan sounds incredibly based i would move there if i wasnt one of the races theyre especially racist against

  they dont have enough population growth to support better economic growth tech and econ advancements are natural partners see pic  they have an enormous aging population with the biggest 60 population in the world but less growth in young cohorts theyve had a net decline recently it was a lost year then a lost decade then lost decades and soon enough a lost generation   the fun isnt theirs to keep though much of the world is developing the same problem coming soon to a country near you
  its true that china steals lots of shit their tech companies doesnt put much money in rd they rather spend money on hacking and spies just look for canadian company nortel
  the only atms that close at 5 are the ones located inside the bank there are still atms at every convenience store that are open 24 hours
  china has gmo babies you couldnt even be bothered to say it properly because you dont take anything seriously hence the pedo anime reaction image  no evidence of their existence  no signs the modifications have worked  just more reports from biotech sponsored media  lol
  and its not all banks  japanese bank atms also tend to be able to handle cash deposits something that is probably around in other countries but i havent seen it
  america letting them in is stealing  america not letting them in is racist    whites leaving is white flight  whites staying or moving in is gentrification    demographically indifferent laws/culture ignore historical context  demographically explicit laws/culture are oppression    climate change means people in the west must be childless  childlessness means the west must import unbounded numbers of literally whos from literally where      china is competitive because they steal shit  china is competitive because their competition is fucking retarded

answer putnams paradox /sci/
  arguing semantics  read schopenhauer and be done with this subject
    stop avoiding the problem and solve it arent you /sci/fags supposed to be good at logic
i read the page twice and still dont know what im reading    more like mathematics and science of which that paper pertains to neither go insult /lit/ or /his/ for being brainlets
  easy putnam is a faggot hence everything he says is wrong
in the first place a theory is not even a law also iirc popper says theories can be sort of composed of multiple part and so they can partially falsified and indeed false  there is no countervailing force  that countervailing force is called reality
trolling faggot has to eventually make use of signs that are so close to those found in other more accurate theories or that are so obviously concessions to that style of thought that their theory cant be said to be true anymore humans respond to incentives and socially endowed consent to believe whatever they want if the society is advanced enough has access to information technology and something like a peer reviewed scientific establishment the fag in question will seem like a spineless retard or an insane person much like how climate change denialists eventually end up imitating scientific arguments for climate change being real and ever so slightly tweaking the parameters of their arguments to yield conclusions that benefit them and their cognitive dissonance this is obviously cowardly transparent and will eventually be contradicted by the very natural forces that slowly drove them away from outlandish deceit same thing must befall anyone who falls for this retardation making things simpler the way the social organism and the way that you adjust to it and reality move is what determines what is right not your opinion if this werent the case no one would be ashamed of having stupid or insane beliefs even religious people get upset if you dont take their lunacy at least a little seriously laughing anime girls all the way down for determining validity or truth value     low verbal iq

charles peirce cringes so hard it rolls him over in the grave
    the paradox stems from our obliviousness of our embodiment within the world that language is music that our reality is contingent that all of our knowledge comes from the past and current situation but not from some platonic world of perfect shapes and abstract objects    we always build upon fabrications of our mind upon inventions of our own throughout the history of mankind     we believe we understand the universe or some region because the tools not theories weve devised just feel right and not just in one way but all the memories in our mind join in unison to overwhelm us with their chant and make us feel that we indeed come out right     we achieve this employing an assortment of techniques to verify the correctness of our assumptions together forming a very large network of reference  we determine eventually that tis true or tis not not simply because it is evident but because my memory says so because my friends agree with me because the crazies and the pseuds dont because i can feel it with my whole being     when it comes to the more obvious facts they are just part of our way of life that cannot even be expressed in terms of langauge these are the simplest operations of the mind that define in large part the life of the various minds working at different levels using the same rules     the glue between signs and referents lies largely on our ability to appreciate and be absorbed by fiction to be sincere or ironic to play the game and be intheworld     in this sense it means to believe in the shared purpose of language and the purpose of each of its signs to use them mostly the way tradition expects and vary slightly away from it     we imitate and harmonize our melodies with that of our fellow human beings all because naturally randomly this leads to greater interaction and hence greater satisfaction    we are part of the phenomena of the universe not separate
  obviously empiricism is a shit epistemology why do you think intellectual chads study pure math and philosophy while nerd virgins study physics and engineering
  cant answer he just refuted realism
im serious males are no longer necessary i mean in most species of animals males are basically just tiny sperm sacks many times smaller than females who use them to impregnate themselves and then eat so life and evolution has already shown the place of males in general  secondary to females and as minimal and efficient as possible   now in modern human society with advanced firearms to render physical strength obsolete in combat machines to render physical strength obsolete in labor and the ability to produce babies without males either via pseudoparthenogenesis or just using the massive volume of frozen sperm whats the point of males they give no benefit that females cant but they also do not have the ability to produce offspring on their own so their essentially just females without the most important ability for survival theyre basically women but missing the ability to reproduce  why should future states invest in males at all
  cuck
  i dont like this but im thinking of this purely rationally there doesnt seem to be a purpose for us anymore  id also like to hear from women lurking the board too if our purpose basically boils down to because us women like men then that doesnt really say anything about us in utility
because childbirth is the only thing womyn can do
grand majority of overachievers and geniuses are male even to this day
  scientifically speaking whats the purpose of male humans anymore    nothing just maintaining modern civilization statistics show that males have slightly higher average intelligence 3 iq points and even more importantly larger variance due to properties of gaussian distributions this means that even assuming equality of opportunity males will vastly outnumber females among people with very high intelligence
  who would work for females as stefan molyneux said most tax money receivers are females and most tax money givers are men
  you seem to be dropping all these claims without basis or any sort of evidence except your own personal ramblings   i think youve made the very simple and lay mistake of drawing your conclusions before your investigation  apply yourself
  everyone needs a scapegoat
scientifically speaking whats the purpose of     scientifically speaking whats this nonscientific thing 
  autism is more common in men
once artificial wombs become a thing women wont be needed anymore either scientifically speaking whats the purpose of humans anymore
  any society that throws away men will soon fall into disarray if they arent conquered by another male group    men are the driving for of evolution and civilization through war and invention man has become the master of the realm women are just along for the ride
  in most species of animals males are basically just tiny sperm sacks many times smaller than females   why are you using that as an argument against male humans when the exact opposite is the case for male humans also all the technology used to allow things like artificial reproduction with female genetics only would of course be figured out built and maintained by men stick to just the human species and its clear your argument doesnt apply female humans are a lot more hindered by their biology compared to females of species that can just lay a bunch of eggs with no child rearing needed and while theyve provided the sexual selection throughout human history that made men ever increasingly innovative and competitive no sexual selection has been applied in the opposite direction leaving women largely out of all the highest levels of achievement for any given domain
  so
/pol/ tier thread    males exist to spread genes and reproduce because humans cannot reproduce asexually this remains true despite advancements in ivf and gene editing because most people arent going to do that and the government will not force them to as for physical ability it doesnt matter because even in war and hard labor women are roughly comparable to men  look at how women often fought alongside persian armies before they got taken over by islam    more on that topic most of the modern gender division we see today exists because of the church and judeochristian religions that infected the west in antiquity one of the reasons for jews having their state taken away from them was that they refuse to recognize certain rights romans gave to their women specifically the right to inherit property the right to sell children into slavery the right to be a widow etc
as someone with amazing ideas and the determination to hurl myself at everything preventing my dreams from becoming a reality i see the purpose of men    women are small minded and lack imagination they arent interested in impressive engineering projects or pushing boundaries they dont like breaking rules or taking risks    men do however men are being feminized by our food our education and the society we exist within    none of my brain development has been dedicated toward developing social skills there simply isnt room for that with everything else that is going on in my head its a serious limitation    days of old men were simple and creative women would support them in various ways at dinner parties and social events the wife could sit back and examine things while the men talked and afterward she could discuss at length the details of the various interactions they participated in    its like the saying every great man has a great woman lifting him up    now though probably mostly due also to hormonal changes triggered by the pill chemical pollutants and food laced with chemicals women have decided they should rule    only they arent good at it certainly they are worse than men at it the world has started to fall apart women cannot save us were headed for disaster and they are too busy buying clothes and getting dicks in nightclubs to realise that we are all in a big pot getting boiled alive    men like me have been pushed out of society rejected and unwanted we have solutions and revolutionary dreams we are motivated by a fiery passion within to see a better world for everyone    there is no room for men in this society we are taught to behave like women and that behaviour is rewardedhowever this society is doomed to fall if it maintains its present course    some generalisations i know there are unique specimens of both sexes
  watch discoverys dirty job series    also stuff like building houses etc    like woman can do it but that would not be economical    also man have penis that can be funny way to get children
  females are better than males because they carry the pregnancy  implying that artificial carrying wont be invented within 100 years  at that point males have the advantage if youre using this line of reasoning you should tread softly around this topic as a result  but less female eggs  every healthy female at the age of puberty has somewhere between 5000001000000 thats one female for hundreds of thousands of live births
scientifically speaking whats the purpose of male humans anymore    now that they single handedly advanced science to the point where they can create females    obviously the next level create males 
  different brain architectures playing off against each other creates more variation and more overall intelligence in the long run yeah shortterm it may seem like it causes more problems than it solves but its an exercise like lifting weights or anything else this isnt even an argument for more diverse workplaces or anything like that just that excluding the other sex from all aspects of your life is inherently limiting
scientifically speaking whats the purpose of everyone posting in this thread
  we dont invest in males thats why they are critical to society a males job is to be disposable and take risks for the good of society if you made females do all the jobs the population would dwindle and die because males are disposable they are also critical to society just look at the in markets who does 99 percent of all dangerous low pay jobs males do you need that shit to keep females protected and making more humans
  and of course the final level  futanari horsecock catgirls
  males in most mammal species are more than a sack of sperm but rather the providers of resources and those resources let the males acquire pussy    why should future states invest in males at all  first of as a failsafeparthenogenic solutions for mankind only help so much to maintain a desirable level of genetic variation not to mention that if shit hits the fan and there is nothing but woman is a good time to say goodbye to our species because there will be no way to fertilize themselves in a postapocalyptic scenario    second and i hate to bring this shit is not ethical the question already implies that either there is some heavy convincing of people to not have boys less resources will be given to men or both   not to mention that if something that could help our whole species in the long run such as gene edition of babies has been verily frowned by several people these last daysthe very proposal of something that would actually result in the elimination of 50 of the population would definately raise concerns unless you a feminist clickbait writer that is    and this is not even considering stuff like the general competitive drive of males that helps things keep going and improving the big  of males in stem fieldsetc
he thinks wamyn could take up emotionally scaring work like war just because its done remotely
  most species    not in higher species
you know ive just had it with leftist/antifa/sjw types that say shit like  men are disposable  men are the cause of all the worlds problems  this kind of leftist lunacy is what made trump president if one day humans could make viable embryos without the precursor sex cells then who do you think is gonna win a war for dominancy fucking faggots and feminist needs to stop viewing men as some kind of enemy because if they push that idea hard enough it will become true
  im not saying men are enemies nor did i say anything about that stuff  im just thinking about this stuff lately
  your agenda shines through clearly shill    because the very same solution that makes males obsolete in your view does so for everyone else as well biotechnology is the ultimate equalizer the technologies that obsolete sperm also obsolete the womb and the egg two males can have a child grown in a vat just as much as two females in fact the very notion of sex falls apart once a society masters its own biology    whether you see this as utopian or dystopian until it happens well happily keep relying on the cognitive and psychological edge and distinctiveness that men bring to the table while shitting on them all the while denying their humanity and importance business as usual in the modern world
  im not shilling for anything anon im serious ive been thinking about this ever since a swedish friend of mine said that its common for female teachers over there to say things like men wont even exist in the future  so i started thinking about it and maybe theyre right
  without women the men would have no reason to do impressive engineering projects or push boundaries though     the reason that life went from asexual to sexual is that the life form started competing with itself and now the process of evolution has more than doubled    so as women become more like men and men become more like women our species is weaker     men and women must either become more polarized to gain the benefits of sexuality or we must transcend human sexuality with an even more adaptive and flexible method of reproduction    kinda blew my own mind right there
  thats the errant dream of farout feminists swedish and otherwise as has been said already the same technology that allows genesis w/o a man can do so w/o a woman both artificial sperm and artificial eggs are conceivable men must exist in the future however for the same reason that women must and that is because life would have no longterm value w/o both of us to either of us without the chance of finding a woman how much of a mans current activities would remain without the chance of finding a man how much for a womans our biological impulses dont have to defeat sustained inquiry as theyre far stronger than mere reason     no sane person a person with a fulfilling and reasonably happy social/sexual life would advocate removing an entire sex of people out of efficiency or whatever similar argument they may espouse those teachers like many male counterparts are just jaded zealots who have no interest in the world beyond their immediate  spiteful wishes
  this is literally what men do they carry genes from their father and mother give that to a woman to splice together you can make a genetic daughter from any two x chromosomes idiot
  you can make a genetic daughter from any two x chromosomes idiot    it cleraly sholws how ignorant you are only combined with male x chromosoes can daughters be produced  combinig x with y chromosomes produces far superior individuals    now stop being a child and shut up
  youre kind of correct we will definitely be all females living in space as they are simply more suited to the environment and more resource efficient youd want to maximize your chances of rapidly producing a new generation if needed    wed need some improvements to invitro tech but thats it
  no need for them  kill all the homosexuals while youre at it to save humanity
  reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
  you realize the male x chromosome is directly from the mother correct
  thats why men are smarter guys are like evolutionary experiments in a way they can exhibit some truly extraordinary positive traits but can also just end up retarded or autistic
  i agree    each sex has unique differences although gender traits are a scale the problem with being a man is that so few of them are needed its also much more difficult to live a comfortable life while expressing masculine traits    it is as you say we are being reduced to a genderless species where neither sex is able to fully utilise their traits
  the reason that life went from asexual to sexual is that the life form started competing with itself  biology isnt science  biology isnt rigorous  lol getting a biology degree is a waste of time  fuck you fucking faggots and your fucking autistic manchild degrees kill yourselves
females are no longer necessary
  they have a womb until an artificial womb is perfected they are necessary so are we    still if every woman disapeared tomorrow im sure we would find a way to grow a human inside the womb of some animal fairly quickly    id rather wait until wombs can be in a cybernetic keg to be perfectly honest
  there were also retards fighting alongside normal armies whats your point unless their k/d was even slightly similar to the usual army of makes it doesnt matter that they also fought
why are you guys pretending like autists are useless instead of accepting that they just have different and in some cases superior capabilities
  cuck
  if you actually believe this ur dumb as fuck how can you actually think this is the case
  so as women become more like men and men become more like women our species is weaker  why would that make the species weaker if the transformation is happening both ways it would only be weaker if it was only going one way if the roles are being fulfilled in both cases it would just take over the old way
  what you are talking about is way too deep into the future if you can conceive a future with parthenogenesis as a possibility in humans why not conceive a future with artificial wombs that would make females obsolete  meanwhile in contemporary society and in the near future there is still a demand for strength intelligence and masculine temperament
  things need to be done    thats why men are needed
  because females are emotionally unstable passive to a fault and insecure to a point where it effects every social/professional interaction women are not capable of the level of organization and complexity as men
men and women are complementary we are very different both physically and mentally     without men women wouldnt be able to create a functioning society and without women men wouldnt have any single living society     we are just a bunch of hairless chimps if we want to see what or primordial instincts would do if we were to live away from each other we could just as well do
  whats the purpose of female humans artificial wombs are advancing to the point where it will be possible for men to reproduce without women at all
females arent really capable of inventing technology or building civilization theyre only good at making babies and they can sort of perform work activities when protected and coddled by men    if men vanished wed be back to the stone age within one century as technology would no longer be invented or maintained
  it is absolutely the opposite way around
  whats the purpose of gender
  creating new human life via sperm
  women would also bully their intelligent minority who can do advance mathematics and science because they would be unable to fathom why thats important at all
perhaps you will be interested in this  
  jesus fuck what an evil gender
  its just biology its a brutal world out there and brutal strategies must be employed
  we must transcend human sexuality with an even more adaptive and flexible method of reproduction    alright im sold on this but what would be a superior form of reproduction     we could move to a system like insects where we have drones and workers and warriors and different types of people perform different functions for society    this is when we start to wonder what we are what is it about humanity that we all wish to preserve we feel a certain satisfaction and a certain kinship when we see our children we see our own eyes and our own mannerisms in them but if we are to transcend human sexuality we must also transcend this simplistic identification with similarity     what do we really wish to preserve about our species intelligence consciousness what even is consciousness and is it even valuable     would it be considered a success to sacrifice our species for the prospect of a new and better species perhaps a digital species
  because youre only getting half of what each sex is capable of it limits us
  scientifically speaking living things serve no purpose but to propagate living things which in turn serve no purpose but to propagate living things    by infinite regress its clear that overall living things of either sex serve no purpose    if this makes you uncomfortable that just goes to show youre too attached to the idea of purpose why not just freely submit to the notion of not having one its okay for you to exist without one isnt it whats so wrong with that
  im serious males are no longer necessary  none of us are necessary retard life is entirely frivolous
  who is gonna open pickle jars and kill spiders
man search for purpose all of life   woman get distracted by hormone and baby
  wish i was born a female what a wonderful world it will be in the future a lesbian planet with women gene editing themselves to have bigger tits/asses than the other
  god yes we should immediatly start destroying useless members of society soon we will come knocking door to door ripping out all the neets from their houses can you imagine it anon   then after were don with that we can go after all the useless and adorable shotas too promising them that were taking them to a happier place only to betray them at the last second as the fear reflects in their eyes males really are pointless and useless creatures hnnnnngh
  this wasnt supposed to be this way
  more like this ia and deep learning will soon overtake majority of your work  human purpose  maybe art
    simple females are naturally dumb so a male is needed to do the gene editing shit
  without males theres no incentive to reproduce
  men are how nature experiments with genetics women are always mundane middle of the road types because having two x chromosomes means new mutations never express themselves in women it is men who exhibit the bold and daring innovation of the world
  why do men type these things out this just doesnt sound like a woman at least try to sound like a woman in your roleplay
bump
  anon do you understand that men and women have evolved to need and complement each other
  then they can further evolve to not need or complement each other  or to complement each other in different ways that are still complementary
  the world has started to fall apart  were doing better than ever before though life expectancy literacy rates atheism child mortality technology medicine violent crime the list goes on humanity is in its golden age
  and what evolutionary driver is there for that eugenics   why argue about a hypothetical future species thats different from us in a question about the relevance of men in our current state of being
  males are no longer necessary  kek
  were also destroying the ecosystem at record levels and its reaching the point where its completely uncertain that well even survive as a species  just one of many examples  
  nah buddy well be fine
    scientifically speaking whats the purpose of male humans anymore    world domination and crushing wmen by creating the patriarchy that they fear
if you kill off all the males the remaining females will be able to keep civilization from collapsing but if you kill off all the females then civilization is doomed the only reason men are civilized at all is so that score with women
  are you a woman  what do you think about all this personally do you want a world with no men or a world like it is now or maybe a third option
  because even with the high ratio of dumb men theres an equal ratio of smart men that push things well maybe not equal but enough men exceed the usual curve of intelligence to push thingsplus even with advancements in automation and ai we need the dumb men for physically demanding jobswich suprises me more the lack propaganda towards those jobs instead they are shamed wich its very dangerous
  atheism  the type of atheism today is so shitit leaves such an empty hole in people and you they hate themselves so much
  ia
  males are what drives the human race forward you idiot  women select the best ones
  humans wont be no longer necessary as soon as we create a good enough ai
  because without males any society will collapse because women cant run a society    boom btfo
  oui
  art is literally just shit that triggers some emotional responses in humans through association or whatever it has no more purpose than hookers or heroin
  humanity as a whole basically
    actually i am a guy but a world without women is too horrible to even think about it is possible that if there were no men that the remaining women would miss us
opinions on freuds body of work
  fraud
  its almost as bad as modern psychology tbqh
  most of it is debunked right anyhow who cares psychology is not even a real science yet its like what chemistry was in the 1600s when they were still trying to do alchemy 100 of the time
  good body of work but neomarxists have distorted his findings to fit and support their agenda
  take it back
  thousands of pages of jewish trickery    when someone compares marxs ideology to freuds subconscious so you know you have to put him down you dont want to but no one deserves to live like that    based and repilled
  clean your methodology
  the low level mechanics and twisty stuff varies but the most general observations and how they evolve is something ive personally witnessed    so regardless of what you think of his other stuff he was unraveling and documenting something real and repeatable
is local warming a thing     if the global warming is caused by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere which absorbs the ir light from the sun which then releases heat i believe thats roughly the main theory now a days anyway the details doesnt really matter this should also be noted in in cities with a higher concentration of greenhouse gasses meaning cities with a lot of air pollution should be suffering from local warming caused by the greenhouse gases making it proportionally warmer than its surroundings depending on the amount of air pollution     ive been searching extensively read googled for 1015 min or so for this theory of mine to pop up anywhere but havent found anything about it there are articles and information describing why cities are generally warmer than the countryside but thats mostly explained by air conditions and general energy expenditure not local warming caused by greenhouse effects    the whole idea stems from this if global warming is real on a global scale it surely must also be real on a local/minor scale but ive found no proof of this the proof of global warming by iccp is mostly stemming from advanced computer simulations not any practical experiments
yes global average is 1 degrees higher than preindustrial times the increase is different for different areas in the canadian north is up by 3 degrees cities are up by a lot more than 1 degree
  global average temperatures must be real on a local scale  ignoring that global average temperatures are determined by countless local measurements
  is local warming a thing  yes     this should also be noted in in cities with a higher concentration of greenhouse gasses   no the local variation in co2 levels isnt that large and the local temperature variation is dominated by other effects    if global warming is real on a global scale it surely must also be real on a local/minor scale  it may be real but completely insignificant    the proof of global warming by iccp is mostly stemming from advanced computer simulations not any practical experiments  thats complete bullshit
  the details doesnt really matter  the details do really matter a great deal
yes easily visible at around zero celsius when there is snowfall outskirts are always more snowy with snow depth increasing from zero centimeters in the city to 20 centimeters a hundred kilometers away
  pole areas warm up more than equator areas roughly speaking theres a correlation with the latitude
who else /step1/    about to finish first pass of uworld got dedicated coming up in about three weeks and i have eight weeks to study     wtf should i do basic knowledge is bad time management is bad depression and adhd at an all time high the only functional thing in my life right now is my haircut     im sort of at a place right now where i would welcome getting hit by a bus    how did you study for step and how did you do
  ive posted many questions about this im currently on goljan audio his talks motivate me what time zone are you in
  west coast mi burrda      i finished my second pass of pathoma a few days ago
  the book video or both  what percentages are you getting on uworld right now im out east but i live by ucla
  how are you getting 8 weeks of dedicated in year two
how did you study and how did you do  im one of those people who pretty much remember something forever if i write it down once i basically just made flashcards and went through them twice 237    i know i didnt help you at all but gl f a m
  you didnt list your sources what books did you use did you use all of first aid
  dank     im getting mid fifties         good shit man great job  book and video
  idk thats just how the schedule worked out
which ir band gives the old nigger look with black skin and white hair what mechanisms are responsible for it
  what mechanisms are responsible for it  variations in wavelength dependent reflectivity or colour taken in bands outside the visible range    i am not sure what wavelength you are looking for but you might look up ir spectrum of skin and hair in uv light skin looks blotchy and diseased    you might note the ir picture has far greater clarity for distant object it would be nice to be able to see natively in ir

to get a degree in an amerishart university you must take 2 classes in a foreign language
and yet here you are posting in english
  this is not required  i mean it was required to get into a university from highschool but its not to get a degree
we have to take a bunch of retarded classes that arent related to our degree
still would rather take that then gender bullshit at least language is useful
  i never had to take any foreign languages in undergrad i did do ap latin though but i dont think that made any difference
its the same in my country most degrees require english i and ii
  only if youre a ba brainlet
brainlet ameritards can barely learn their own language
not true i got my bachelors in me and i never had to take a foreign language    stay mad euro cuck
  its required you take it in highschool so you dont need it in college
    it occurs to me that high school english classes and some college english classes are very poorly handled the formal syntax grammar rules etc of english are not given due consideration most of these classes have a heavy focus on creative writing and basic comprehension skills which anyone who has ever read more than a couple books in their lifetime will already possess
    ah and the dreaded book report regurgitate this book in a few paragraphs     thats productive
  you can take any humanities classes you want but you would need to be mentally ill if you want to take wαmyn studies 188 the inexorable rapist in every man and african american studies 420 gib me ur house cracker i be all in generational poverty from historical oppression marginalization and sheit over japanese 105106 basic japanese for doujinshi reading 12
  wαmyn studies 188 the inexorable rapist in every man and african american studies 420 gib me ur house cracker i be all in generational poverty from historical oppression marginalization and sheit    i shit you not this is what one of my college english classes was like
  formal syntax and grammar rules arent taught in english class
  for a ba degree sure
    gives pressure to actually read a book to gain the skills you commissioned about being trivial to learn if youre going to take it gives skills to quickly find information without reading an entire book also give presentational skills even if it is purely in writing do you want people to just memorize a bunch of grammar they wont actually apply do you want people to know the difference between who and whom i learn those things in a foreign language and easy to apply to english since youre given comparisons between the two
    they are but it often takes a backseat to the content of what were reading eg the themes characters etc its like taking a video game design class where you just playing video games and review them and maybe make one or two small mods once in a while    the language structure be the topic of discourse in any class entitled english or whatever other language
    where you just playing video games  the language structure be the topic    see look at this shit what have they been teaching us
tfw four semesters
  i had to minor in a fl
  that is for the retard tier arts version of a degree you can get a bs or ba in some fields and the difference is they substitute the higher math courses for arts and languages it basically just makes a bunch of super shitty scientists its a really good idea
  you can get a bs or ba in some fields and the difference is they substitute the higher math courses for arts and languages    it depends a lot on the university
  i substituted my language classes for cultural classes one was a comparative class on death and afterlife the other was some weird class on geography it turned out that was actually cultural geography and it was very sjw but i actually learned a lot about culture the class was completely bs dont get me wrong but some of the readings really did change my view it was weird going from my regular science classes and then in the middle of the day have something like so capetown is running out of water and then leaving to take two buses to my next class

  yes it is because 9999999  1 so any e  0  1 is obviously greater than 1    kill yourself

  read a primer of infinitesimal analysis apparently that only works if you assume the law of excluded middle otherwise infinitesimals can exist that is using intuititionistic logic
  have you ever seen an infinite set of numbers retard no such thing exists

whats the probability of getting dubstrips quads  etc     small boards  medium boards  big boards
  for this reply zero
  test
i dunno kiddo but check these anyway
  the probability is the same for all boards
  youre a dumbass
this will also not be dubs
  i think not /b/ or /r9k/ are much more easier to get dubs than small boards like /an/
                  watch this faggots
  /b/ or /r9k/ are much more easier to get dubs than small boards like /an/  you can easily predict likely getting dubs on very small boards large boards have some probability involved sort of since you could consider a small army of shitposters to be a random process
  100 for me
  owowowoowowowoowowowowowoowowwhuaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
  the probability is the same for example your chances of getting dubs in any given comment is the number of dubs combinations00 11 22 etc over the number of total combinations100  10/100 which is 10 you might have the impression that he chances on a fast board are bigger because you have incentive to post more
  nice
  fucking brainlet    the post id is not randomly assigned
  how is it then
  its literally an ascending integer   for example the post below my will only be 25 digits above this one
  see
  how did you determine this numbers
  hes cracked the algorithm
  in this case i would guess you were lucky because the board is slow had you waited more to post could you still predict a range for your post
  look faggot its not that hard to understand  every new poster gets a number1  if nobody posted between my first post and second one my id will only be 1  it say 5 people posted something on this board between my first and second one it would have been     so basically you can time your post right to get dubs
    since we can safely assume that there are 10 possible digits within each place value the chance of getting a triple or quad is    101010 which is 1/1000 for a triple  10101010 which is 1/10000 of getting a quad
  ao its no different from what i said here  i just assumed comments were posted randomly never said the number was randomly generated by the server or something like that
  no its not  do you understand what probability means  you could actually write a script which will get you dubs with 100 probability
  there are 10 possible trips out of 1000 combinations though
  its not 100 because your script might not be fast enough when reading new posts which basically only happens on fast boards
  so its actually the other way around its way easier to get dubs randomly on a small board because as i said you can just fucking time it    
  i dont understand how you are thinking the only way i could conceive this was by counting the number of new posts in a board and timing your comment and even though wouldnt be 100  also here are two consecutive posts with a spread greater than 25    
  kekus maximus
  i see so you are not actually answering the question just shitposting about getting dubs on a small board
  impressive very nice
  write a script which listens to every thread on the board  if a new post appears add one to the global id  write a post in a thread where you want to get dubs/trips/whatever  verify captcha and script automatically clicks on post when the global id reaches the desired number  its really not that hard anon
  this is not 100 some post could reach the server after you increment the counter and before your post reach the server  also you didnt answer the question op asked you are just detailing the thread to shitpost about getting dubs on a slow board
  so in very rare instances your script is to slow so the answer to ops question is the probability of getting dubs or any desired number x for that matter is   px109q where q is the general desirability of that number on an arbitrary range of 01  with q1 being a number something like 77777777  and dubs being something like q001
  this is a very low quality comment stop shitting the board
  better than muh probability is the same  literally brainlet tier analysis
  checkem
the first one to get trips can fuck me  tanaka asuka
  gaki no tsukai  my nigga
  check these
  pathetic

  can you do anything right
  and heres another one for good measure
      cant you have some mercy

can someone explain to me what binding selectivity and isomers are also general molecular structure im trying to learn about drug and oranometalic chemistry but wikipedia aint no textbook  pic for attention
i recommend watching videos not reading wikpedia if you dont want to actually study it from books
learning calculus when you dont know basic algebra    this board is filled with retards for sure
i normally wouldnt bother with a question so broad but you happened to be in luck im currently studying for a quiz on selectivity for drug research  binding selectivity in relation to general molecular structure is related to energy when atoms are bonded together theyre going to want to take the lowest energy conformation possible this is influenced by a number of factors refer to pic as to whether a ligand will actually bond to the molecule in drugs this would be the protein/enzyme target depends on if it is a favorable reaction to bond with this is what you could call your selectivity for specifics in energy just search up the term gibbs free energy   specifically im talking about proteinligand docking im only talking specifically about this because i happened to be studying that specific thing right now hopefully someone else will answer the incredibly simple concepts of isomers or something to you can you really not find that on wikipedia
  but wikipedia aint no textbook    why are you reading wikipedia your exam will most likely be based off of the information from your textbook
am i the only one who finds it weird how some people are so fanatic about denying climate change why is some john doe so invested in denying it i dont get it
  blame jews or women and move on
  senses his environment is being mobilized to act against his and its own interests realizes he doesnt exist in a vacuum might fill some void by having something
    the long and short of it is that its associated with liberalism
those are paid shills  remember their goal is not to change your mind their goal is to create this illusion that a substantial part of the electorate is anticlimate change action shilling is about optics not debate its about making the casual internet browser think that the public opinion is more divided than it really is
  unironically this is the answer    the people that tend to do that are the common folk types religious etc their psychology is very anxious the idea that we are dooming the world and all of  civilization gives them anxiety and paranoia these people are so honest that if they genuinely believed it they would take blame and stop driving cars carbon emissions etc altogether when a narrative come to claim that it is a hoax their anxiety can be nietralized by subscribing to it this gives them peace of mind that is why there are so many people willing to lie for the sake of preserving the disorder that would break out if the common man understood implications of climate change the standard liberal on the other hand has replaced the anxiety of being and of the future of civilization with resentment towards others in society the liberal types tend to enjoy to push the doomsday scenario because their guilty they hate humans etc the idea of flexing your knowledge and doing the right thing also appeals to a liberal mindset they like to be strong intellectually and they want that to mean something especially in a society where they are alienated all in all it is a manufactured debate it is obvious that it is occurring but the steps the left take are tainted with resentment hatred and egalitarian poison its a difficult situation
holy shit you guys are so fucking stupid the reason they deny climate change is because the policies that would have to be out in place to stop it would cripple the economy and cost a lot of money
  yet doing nothing would cost more according to pretty much every analysis best or worst case
    its because of the us vs them approach to everything
  climate change generally hurts the economy much more than the policies that would hurt it now a little bit
  my country has a lot of old coal powered generation capacity at endoflife the costs to build new coal capacity is insane and the relatively welloff government knows its a bad business decision   even without subsidies and purely on economic merit solar/wind are going to cost less with far lower ongoing maintenance costs   and thats as a country with a shitload of coal
  it would do the exact opposite it would be a huge economic boom especially for any people who are in the trades and besides you pretend like climate change itself isnt the biggest economic cost of the century according to the us government 10 of gdp will be lost by the end of the century due to climate change    
yeah fuck the environment /pol/bros we fucking make that money yeah guys get fucking rich fuck the earth that shits for fags
  even if the usa changed coarse and tried to fight climate change it wouldnt do shit to change china and every other shithole country to change hell theyd probably become stronger then the us since there industrial output wouldnt be crippled by regulations
  couldnt be more false only the us is unwilling to tackle climate change china in particular are doing everything in their might to stop using coal and oil buy yeah keep spreading lies
  defends /pol/tier retardation with politics argument
  china in particular are doing everything in their might to stop using coal and oil  literal brainlet
i was im china for 2 weeks just a month ago  it was surreal staring at the midday sun it was just a fuzzy yellow blob  one of my days there was a warning to stay indoors i went out and got a fucking nose bleed
  youre not kidding are you  damn china seems like the future its like what the world is like in overlord
  china loves being a wasteland
  same retard shit as cigarettes 40 years ago  
  because it was made into a political talking point and a money making scheme  if it was truly about saving the environment then we wouldnt see regulations like we see them implemented and the middle class are the ones that see how they are implemented in their work environments not the rich or the poor who truly believe in this snake oil
  belief perseverance is part of the explanation     belief perseverance is the tendency for people to hold their beliefs as true even when there is ample evidence to discredit the belief when faced with evidence that contradicts their beliefs people may choose to discredit dismiss misinterpret or place little significance on the contradictory information

is psychology merely a pseudoscience
yes it could be a real science but we need the equivalent of what the telescope was for astronomy

    its a perfect solution which frees us from having to listen to their opinions on things outside of objectively measurable phenomena pertaining to their field and their field alone and it frees them from the distractions such as moral intuitions and human consciousness which they are so disturbed by that they need to deny the very existence of these things    just picture it thousands upon thousands of stemfags walking out the clinic back towards their test tubes or whatever they do imagine the grotesque rictus smiles on their chinless anglo faces im finally free they would think were they not indeed finally free from that thing which they felt most keenly to be a burden on them qualia human consciousness and all the beauty passion love emotion all the duty the sense of virtues the religious hunger the ups and downs and bends and curves of being human all that aesthetic moral spiritual noise which plagued them like tinnitus until my act of kindness

  eh eh uh uhpsychology is just a ground for human understanding its not universal because there are civil boundaries for the most part there are basic truths other than that everything seems to venture into the political for example in war recovering regions youll realize women tend to be more intimidating than men you dont even get the opportunity to act cocky or arrogant they dont understand that and are put off by it they however do understand a good nut in them and you have to respect their reproductive cycle religion cant even get involved in areas generally stable like the west men tend to be more cocky and more prized sort of like a mating act for a long time if you were a grad from somewhere else you couldnt practice in the us because there are different psychological boundaries implemented many of my extended acquaintances are phds and cant practice in the us which gets them mad how easy it has been for foreign college students to practice in the us when curriculums revolve around each of their geopolitical standing us is considered a potential war ground at all times therefore there are things that are not legal to do afflicted parties must travel out and do it at there birth place trust me there are markings of disambiguation you cannot lie for example eastern european people get skin tags

is it possible to classically condition someone to be gay or develop philiasanyone heard any studies/experiments on this
  there might be critical developmental windows ie look at orangutans and suppression of developing flanges by a powerful resident male
  read up on pizza gate and the high rate of homosexuality amongst child sex abuse victims  pedos breed faggots
    in short no
  this  taking dick when youre a child makes you gay
  theres mixed signs in mice suppressed beta males will often try to mate with alpha males but that could be entirely social and not a sexual desire    cringe and bluepilled
  this is basically why the bible is all cut off their heads protecting children is good
what if at the moment of orgasm you continually flashed pictures of men and slowly conditioned the orgasm with the image of a man now that the man is associated with the orgasm gayness thoughts
scientists have discovered that exposure to 4chan and 4channel cause homosexuality in 100 of cases
  you become more attracted to whatever youre looking at when you cum  well no shit
  i was watching hentai as a kid that kept cutting to a guy watching the sex i told myself if you cum to that guy youre gay now i have sex with men
  scene is getting really good  great angle  great view of the woman  close to cumming  point of orgasm  camera switches to the mans face
  it cuts to a closeup of his balls and taint
  ive just switched to stills and solo / masturbation stuff it can be hot to see what a woman looks like when shes having sex but ultimately this has to be processed as either voyeurism or using the context / man as a self insert a third state exists which is just abstraction / detachment but regardless its probably not good to experience ones sexuality that way and to allow what would ordinarily be personal fantasy based to be controlled by what someone else has decided youll see theres just too much bullshit in porn even amateur    on this topic while i knew porn was a form of media and therefore could be used for social engineering the other day it hit me precisely why access porn allows unguarded and near unfettered access to ones sexuality which is otherwise tucked away like look at all the incest porn flooding the mainstream theres always been incest themed porn but its reached an extreme people likely assume this is a trend or a reaction but id argue its more likely a guide you have the beautiful woman for bait surrounded by degenerate and bizarre contexts and people are being inundated by it its functions as another influence to destroy whats left of the family unit
  switched to stills and solo / masturbation stuff  it cuts to a closeup of her balls and taint
  no escape
  i think this has a lot to do with how strong an individuals sense of identity is and how susceptible they are to being influenced    my mother tried to turn me into a homosexual culminating in a string of rapes which i suspect she had a hand in organising    ive never been sexually attracted to a male and im straight    because i want to be i decide what i am    a lot of weak minded people just kind of accept the way their life goes others resist because they have their own identity and dont need one created for them    if you want to put your sex organ inside another mans shit hole youre mentally ill    if you want somebody to put theirs in yours then youre reliving a time you were victimised probably as a coping strategy
  yes you can dont have any good sources though
  the effect of trauma especially sexual trauma on human psychology has been well studied convincing oneself that they like or need to repeat the abuse is a common dissociative strategy    on another note  put your sex organ inside another mans shithole  ive wondered if homosexuals are genuinely attracted to the butthole or if its simply that the desire to penetrate is intact and thats the only orifice there is the existence of the prostate having some role    regardless the notion that exclusive homosexuality is natural ie not defective behavior seems absurd
  i think that from the perspective of the top it is usually a result of their own inadequacies and their frustration at being unable to attain a female    they regain a sense of power and control over their lives by substituting a male    i find poo quite distasteful so i definately believe homosexuality is a mental disorder    i also believe homosexuality is a choice and that the only reason homosexuals claim that it isnt is out of fear of persecution    also convincing someone that they chose to be gay to cope with the trauma of their abuse is likely to upset people
  dont have any good sources though  what is ancient greece medieval turkey and north africa etc  what is modern saudi arabia  sexuality is socially constructed rather than innate if you were raised in a society in which fucking boipussy was normalised you would do it too
  youre unironically retarded    bonobo monkeys rub eachothers genitalia to relax its sort of like that
  why do bonobos rub friends genitalia but nobody rubs mine except me
  i disagree its completely unusual and additionally poses a health risk homosexuals are mentally ill
  this tbqh
  oh also if we are comparing animals    what i described is similar to how homosexuality works with elephants i dont think any ordinary bonobo is going to rub same sex genitalia unless they are inferior in the social hierarchy and have no access to opposite sex partners
  heterosexual activities are risky too so by your illogical assumptions all nonasexual people are mentally ill because they are voluntarily agreeing to a possibilty of getting stds
  do you think gay people on some level dislike being gay on a missing out level it would suck to not be able to experience all the aspects of attraction to the opposite sex you even see homosexual pairings naturally separate into masculine and feminine roles probably because this is the basis of stable and fulfilling pairing in humans
  sure theres risk but its easy to take precautions and the risks dont come with the scent of fresh poo    im glad i wont ever experience poo under my foreskin poo and sex are an unusual combination face it
  war is objectionably the gayest thing on the planet because you spend the entire campaign with the sole and expressed purpose of penetrating other men    /lit/

  what theyre missing out on is intimacy and bonding with something other than their own general image
  saudi restricts all access to women to avoid corrupting the young men the young men all fuck each other its an interesting set up anyone whos worked there can confirm   the more important question for us is are these young men fucking each other because they were born that way and their sexuality is an immutable part of their being and their identity is it just the society and culture they are in

  you forgot number theory and matrix algebra  honestly gauss didnt really do that much amazing stuff but a lot that he did do is used a lot
    fuck off op
is he the goat
  he did a lot of amazing stuff
couldnt even count to 100
  talking shit about papa gauss    nigger is you serious
  meh he stole all his results from riemann
why did sea levels rise 400ft was it because cavemen drove their hummers to much or was it because cavemen didnt pay enough carbon tax    
  comet fragment impact near greenland    /thread
  actual climate scientist here i study atmospheric gases in ice core    we know quite well the mechanisms and nuts and bolts of the last deglaciation it started with the milankovitch cycle  the amount of solar radiation and the seasonality of the earth changes because the earths orbit stretches and wane due to gravitational pulls from other planets at 18ka solar insolation in the northern hemisphere started to ramp up 2nd figure from top this causes the north american ice sheets to melt addition of saltwater destabilizes the thermohaline circulation  that is driven by sinking cold salty water in the north atlantic the destabilization of thermohaline circulation causes antarctica to warm not plotted but you can find any ice core temp record from antarctica it looks like co2 think about it as the ocean current being a liquid cooling on cpu that is antarctica distruption of the thermohaline circulation causes heat to build up in antarctica heat build up melt away sea ice intensify the antarctic circumpolar circulation and allow co2 from the deep ocean to exhale back to atmosphere green figure on the left co2 from the southern ocean causes global warming and brought the whole planet out of the ice age     what  is talking about is the sudden reversal at the onset of younger dryas other deglaciation along the milankovitch cycle did not have a reversal so the yd reversal and snap back might be related to short term cooling due to asteroid
  addition of saltwater destabilizes the thermohaline circulation  that is driven by sinking cold salty water in the north atlantic    whoops i meant addition of freshwater from the ice melt destabilizes the thermohaline circulation
  so it wasnt because cavemen were driving hummers and paying enough carbon tax    sounds to me like there are much bigger influences on earths climate than anything that the human race combined could ever hope to accomplish 1 of    so why dont we all get honest about it    thank you for taking the time btw you come across as someone in a much higher pay grade than this little peasant i appreciate your time anon
  do you believe that co2 released by human industry has different physical properties than co2 released by natural events
  my expertise is not with respect to present day climate change however as you can see 70 ppm on co2 causes global warming of about 4 degrees c and 20c warming in greenland this is where scientists got the number on climate sensitivity per doubling of co2 even after accounting for band saturation effect in which the warming potential of any greenhouse gas decreases the more you put on it without co2 and other globally well mixed ghg methane n2o you cannot go out of the glacial state through effects of ocean circulation solar insolation and heat redistribution alone ghg acts like an amplifier to the solar insolation    the greenhouse effect is a pretty simple physics and the 120ppm that we put into the atm through the preindustrial revolution is comparable to the amount of co2 increase in the whole deglaciation     what were doing currently is turning the knob to the max on the amplifier knob im in line with the rest of my peers that the present day climate change is anthropogenic and will be a serious issue
  can someone help me come up with a more cringeable response than because you touch yourself at night
  you dont seem to realize that current global warming is an order of magnitude faster than interglacial warming 12000 years ago not only are we influencing the climate but were doing it much more than anything nature has done in at least the last 600000 years    so why dont we all get honest about it  we are if you bothered to check you would have found that this is widely discussed in public humans are not the only thing that can affect the climate we are just the main thing affecting the climate right now and that effect is both extremely anomalous and harmful to the infrastructure and ecosystems we rely on
  nope i dont i just believe that at 426ppm co2 the earth is a dangerously low level of atmospheric co2 considering most plants have evolved to grow best at levels of 1000ppm co2 and cant survive at levels of 200ppm co2    i think that were worrying about the wrong thing and totally ignoring real threats threats like solar activity or lack thereof    i honestly believe were helping the world by introducing more co2 into the atmosphere
  the amount of solar radiation  he admits it
  considering most plants have evolved to grow best at levels of 1000ppm co2  this is tested in a greenhouse room where they got unlimited nutrient from fertilizer in reality theres limit to how much plant can grow because plant needs nitrogen phosphate and iron we are seeing greening in the high latitudes but even the current global greening has slowed down the rest of excess co2 will go into the ocean and causes ocean acidification    if youre greenland russia canada vermont and maine you can argue that global warming is good for you but for the rest of the world the net effect is negative
  its duh sun  too bad incoming solar radiation is decreasing and will be decreasing over the next 10000 years according to the milankovich cycle    
  he admits it    this is a strawman argument whether temperatures have been warmer or colder in the past is largely irrelevant to the impacts of the ongoing warming if you dont care about humans and the other species here global warming may not be all that important nature has caused warmer and colder times in the past and life survived but those warmer and colder times did not come when there were almost seven billion people living as we do the best science says that if our warming becomes large its influences on us will be primarily negative and the temperature of the holocene or the cretaceous has no bearing on that furthermore the existence of warmer and colder times in the past does not remove our fingerprints from the current warming any more than the existence of natural fires would remove an arsonists fingerprints from a can of flammable liquid if anything nature has been pushing to cool the climate over the last few decades but warming has occurred
  yep theyre chemtrailing heavily but ultimately cant fight it
  i may be a little biased i admit that living in a place that has 9 month winters winters that havent stopped being 9 month winters during this whole global warming panic has left me a little jaded if anything there is more snow now and it just keeps getting colder     100 miles north of the us border
  imagine being this retarded  you realize that fossil fuels are sequestered carbon saved up from millions of years and weve burned through it all in like two centuries right do you understand that our consumption of fossil fuels is measured in gigatons/year i assume you know that co2 is a greenhouse gas so why should it surprise you that releasing enough to change the concentration of the atmosphere increases the heat retention of the planet were you dropped on your head as a child
  if we resequester that co2 and get rid of it well be net reducing the available oxygen on the surface
  you are full of shit and have no clue what you are talking about why dont you just inform yourself before spouting your uninformed opinion    fyi if we burned all fossil fuels we consider economically exploitable we would go beyond 4000 ppm which is twice as many as the peak co2 roughly 500 million years ago and back then earth was almost 20 degrees c warmer than today
  do you live in canadian east coast or west coast you might be one of the unlucky few who are affected by the cold blob  related to present day disruption of again the thermohaline circulation from melting greenland ice     this is the only region in the world that is consistently cooling in line with most climate models
  i just believe that at 426ppm co2 the earth is a dangerously low level of atmospheric co2 considering most plants have evolved to grow best at levels of 1000ppm co2 and cant survive at levels of 200ppm co2  weird so plants did not evolve over the last million years or so to adapt to their environment where co2 never went above 300 ppm are your sure you believe in evolution
  retard
  climate deniers everybody you cant make this shit up
  the fires in california this year released more co2 than all human industry this year nature burns itself down constantly and would much more regularly if humans didnt stop it     human causes are a spec compared to what nature causes    id insult you back but im not here to insult anyone so thank you
  of course they adapted they adapted to grow smaller and weaker
  let me guess you also think that volcanoes release more co2 than humans
  co2 is a gas and therefore difficult to sequester so it would likely be turned into a different store of carbon using a fuckton of energy before being sequestered besides that if we dont sequester everything that weve released in the next century the vast majority of humanity will die and civilization will probably fall
  natural tree growth absorbs much more co2 than is released by wildfires nature absorbs more co2 than it releases man does not if man was not emitting then we would be cooling as usual science deniers dont look at the complete picture
  it also occurs to me that co2 might be genuinely causing climate change but theyre opportunistically making it look worse than it is    regardless there will be a lot more trees when theyre done unless theyre another species and plan to trigger ecological collapse and purge most terrestrial and marine life which seems equally likely with all the aluminum theyre putting down the gwen towers and then the 5g antennas i can only imagine what theyll be able to do to a given ecology
    i live in western canada where your chart is saying much warmer than average    your chart is wrong 9 month winters
  imagine being this retarded  the trees took the carbon out of the atmosphere first trees and biomass are carbon neutral how did you even get a highschool degree
  you dont seem to realize that current global warming is an order of magnitude faster than interglacial warming 12000 years ago    climate scientist here im on your side but you have to be careful about which time period youre talking about at 12ka youre talking about specifically younger dryas warming and the yd warming is actually about the same as the rate of current warming see the top blue figure however as  pointed out the yd warming might be unnatural because it is driven by the snapback from asteroid cooling     what you really want to say is that were warming on the order of magnitude faster than the last deglaciation as a whole and were already at an interglacial climate so it is completely unnatural to have younger dryas like warming during the interglacial
  show me your detailed temperature records please
  civilization as we know it is toast anyway theyve decided you arent continuing and you wont stop them they thoroughly control what youll think see and admit    youre a trained animal and youre headed towards dying like a neutered dog
  malnourishment is not an adaption all ecosystems man relies on are adapted to the climate of the last million years taking them out of that climate so rapidly without time for them to adapt is very harmful
  during years of multiple major eruptions absolutely    
  is this an elaborate troll meant to make deniers look even more mentally deranged than they are because its working
  no but i considered trolling you by pretending to be someone else and calling it a false flag
  the fires in california this year released more co2 than all human industry this year    lol thats a load of horseshit all natural carbon emissions including all wildfires around the globe volcano eruptions or any other sources dont even make up 2 of carbon emissions per year yes its actually that bad nature releases around 700 million tons of carbon into the atmosphere humans release 35 billion currently humanity is releasing 50 times as much carbon every year as the whole nature around the globe does
  i cant think of anything to help the situation so were all doomed and shouldnt do anything about it  you and yours are definitely doomed i am a forward thinker who actively prepares for crop failure and climate refugees and i have several decades left at minimum to prepare
  then i dont know what to tell you man you actually live on one of the fastest warming region in the planet     how old are you maybe you have selective memory because you remember the miserable cold days but dont remember the less miserable less cold days that is on average warmer than normal also this is with respect to 1950s baseline so if youre not 68 years old you dont know what the baseline looks/feels like
  i was under the impression that the younger dryas warming was not a global phenomenon certainly locally it was faster than current warming in places like greenland but i was talking about global warming please clarify
    call me a denier im just being honest about what im personally experiencing 9 month winters    ive only been through 40 or so of them
  where are your temperature records
    another thing to consider is that snow  cold youre getting more snow and more precipitation because warmer air hold more moisture increased snow precipitation is observed all over the northern latitudes
  co2 and other emissions are causing earth to retain more heat heating up our earth
  depends on what you mean by local the effect of yd warming is felt all the way into the mid latitudes    the rest of the globe is warming as average but because the northern hemisphere is snapping back from localized cooling then the whole planet is warming faster than average if you combine all the hemisphere and take a derivative of temperature at 12ka that is about the rate of warming were currently undergoing from 18502018
    all i can tell you anon is your charts are wrong things here on ground level are very different than what your charts are saying ill give you an example we lost our harvest this year everything was destroyed by cold in early september fields of frozen buried crops everywhere around here were lucky any year we can harvest before were frozen out    its about 50/50
    sorry 12ka i meant more like 115ka
  unfortunately there are major elements that are less straightforward popular and overt and which require a bit of fortune a lot of work and some insight to foresee i doubt youve controlled for such things    so dont get too ahead of yourself you might only seem ahead because youre too many steps behind to realize which direction you need to be going    also spoiler unless youre in a way rural area apart from proximity to the grid youre going to have major crippling problems with your health at least im honest within reason i do act like climate change is a thing because it is when framed more narrowly as ecological change ive been trying to protect animals and the environment from the mad beast that is man my entire life and unfortunately its just a matter of losing ground until youre standing in the middle of a wasteland watching people fight over who gets to stand on the lone tree stump thats how it would go that is if it werent having an end put to it    not sure where its going to end or what climate change really is but i can tell you for sure the world and your life isnt going to go the way you think it is and thats my vague message to the deaf ears of a forward thinking visionary nears i can tell the latest in an arrogant breed of morons ive been dealing with my entire life    good luck guy
  do you like have some statistics to back that up
  no temperature data  do you understand that there is a difference between weather and climate
  you mean major volcanic activity in the past over hundreds of thousands of years can match a few years of human emissions thats not exactly supporting your point
  
  ah thank you
  when the weather is freezing cold 9 months out of every year i can remember does that make it climate
  preparing for an apocalypse is hard and therefore not worth doing  t future climate refugee
  i doubt you can hide your mental illness that well
  no because youre unreliable
  unfortunately anecdotal evidence doesnt carry much weight here especially when youre arguing against actual scientific research maybe /pol/ is more your speed
  no thats weather climate is a much broader concept     
  helping plague vectors spread their egregore to more husk humanity  no you should kys tho anon thanks
btw even if you think im a retarded brainlet i appreciate everyone here whos taking the time to post in this thread especially the smart ones    thank you
    yeah also you dont want to splice the marcott temperature curve with modern temperature like what you did here  i know shaun personally and this is his major pet peeve he think that this is just as dishonest as climate denier posting temperature from 1998 el nino year to today providing an artificially high temperature baseline dont take it from me heres from shaun himself      is the rate of global temperature rise over the last 100 years faster than at any time during the past 11300 years  our study did not directly address this question because the paleotemperature records used in our study have a temporal resolution of 120 years on average which precludes us from examining variations in rates of change occurring within a century other factors also contribute to smoothing the proxy temperature signals contained in many of the records we used such as organisms burrowing through deepsea mud and chronological uncertainties in the proxy records that tend to smooth the signals when compositing them into a globally averaged reconstruction we showed that no temperature variability is preserved in our reconstruction at cycles shorter than 300 years 50 is preserved at 1000year time scales and nearly all is preserved at 2000year periods and longer our montecarlo analysis accounts for these sources of uncertainty to yield a robust albeit smoothed global record any small upticks or downticks in temperature that last less than several hundred years in our compilation of paleoclimate data are probably not robust as stated in the paper    the idea is that the blue curve   has 120yr running average in ityou cannot splice modern temperature measurement with annual resolution on top of a curve that has 120yr running averageto be consistent you also need to run 120yr running average on the orange and red curve that you posted
  im sorry about your crops where do you live again depending on your age you might have selective memory in remembering the cold miserable days but forgetting the less cold warmer than average days also precipitation is not equal to cold in really cold region like northern canada and antarctica warming allows for air to hold more moisture and snow more this is why east antarctic ice sheet is currently gaining mass despite temperature warming
  youve somehow flipped that im going to be more prepared into that im going to be less prepared    why would you do that
  can you give us a rundown of how fucked or not fucked we are in your opinion and why
  fucking kek ive lived in western canada for decades and the winters are way warmer than they were when i moved here
  what specifically are you doing to prepare
  youre a fucking liar i live in south western canada and weve had no such cold nothing even close to freezing here
  wow imagine being such a partisan baby that you equate previous climate events to current uniquely human events     stick to shitposting  thinking isnt really your fort
  then idk what to tell you man  you sound exactly like an idiot hyper liberal friend of mine whenever i say hes wrong on something go fuck yourself literally taking what you read and just repeat it without much thinking like a college liberal moron
  its influences on us will be primarily negative  whys that    also is there any chance that well get two foot long dragonflies again
  not him but the size increase in insects was due to high oxygen levels of the past when we burn coal we actually turn oxygen into co2 so if anything insects should shrink in the future
  muh nature has always changed    yes it did and it whiped out entire species while doing so we are next     muh humans didnt cause this climate change    this is the most ridiculous argument of all the industrialisation of the human race is without a doubt the single most intenste climate change event in earths 45 billion year history we are pumping so much carbon into the atmosphere every year that nothing in the history of earth comes even close to that
  shouldnt there be an increase in flora that reverts that
  we are next  youre probably sitting in wifi right now with a cell phone in your pocket so youre already being sterilized if you dont change soon your lineage is not going to be part of any we    5g will be much worse you will ignore it and let it come
  if anything the net flora on earth is decreasing mainly in the rainforest where the majority of terrestrial o2 is produced people are chopping it down
  mainly in the rainforest  its pretty much everywhere at this point  
  how important can the insects be when nobody even noticed that their number decreased by 70
  take a look around you i doubt you see anything but walls
  yeah so i said nobody not just me farmers didnt notice forest rangers didnt notice nobody noticed so how important can they really be
  obviously people were noticing something thats why the study was conducted back to my previous post farmers dont need insects you dont need insects but just because they dont have value to you doesnt mean that our ecosystem doesnt hinge on them
  but thats the point if ecosystems hinged on them we sure as fuck would have noticed it that their number is decreasing drastically so how important can they really be
    whys that    my take is that there is hysteria and dishonest argument on both sides for example as i mentioned  however it is also clear that the warmist side is less wrong than the denialist side a personal irk of mine is that the more outspoken and aggressive climate scientists tend to be modelers gavin schmitt michael mann while some of the people who actually measure things pieter tans head of noaa global monitoring division are more reserved in their claims as a person who does measurement for a living i think the media should give more voice to people who measure things and not predict things in the future because we are more measured as they say no one believes a model except the modeler everyone believes a measurement/experiment  except the person who made the measurement/experiment    overall the effect of anthropogenic climate change is real and observable the discussion then boils down to how much of modern climate change is manmade this question lack the specifics in terms of what global temperature wildfires hurricane sea ice ice sheet size theres different level of anthropogenic footprint and uncertainties in each of those variables     the effect of climate change regardless it is anthropogenic or not will predominantly be negative because resource redistribution creates instability in socioeconomic system present day apple farmer will be wine farmer by 2100 maple tree farmer will be apple farmer and people who hunt elk up north will be maple tree farmer for that to happen though it requires multiple season of failed harvest until people adapt and the socioeconomic cost of those adaptation is nonnegligible overall if youre upper middle class in developed world youre probably gonna be ok unless you live in climate change hotspot like florida sea level rise or california wildfire drought if youre lower middle class in developing world then youre in a world of hurt
  implying your neighbours wont just shoot you if you refuse to share once tshtf
  but we did notice that they were decreasing thats why the study was conducted thats why weve conducted it pretty much every year and have a chart showing a decline from the 50s thats why we have a reference point to say that the populations have decreased by 80 its just nobody did anything about it pesticides were never outlawed so the insects continued to die
  ecologists and entomologists say that humans would die out if all insects vanished were seeing similar collapses in fish stocks birds and mammals   why arent we seeing the effect yet well we are its getting harder to catch fish weve been keeping up because were getting better at locating them and fishing deeper were relying on our own pollinators too honey bees when and if they collapse well definitely see very strong effects
  who cares we can grow meat in the lab and we can grow crops in a greenhouse
  i too seek death anon
  perhaps you have more precise and updated informations about what most likely caused petm 
  guess what else ecologists and entomologists say manmade electromagnetic emissions are causing ecological destruction death of pollinators death of trees death of birds via compromising their shell formation and development death of newts and amphibians because theyre incredibly vulnerable to oxidative stress their small size and electromagnetic pollution acting in conjunction with other toxins    but youre just some little yuppie brat who doesnt give a shit as long as he gets his social credit so quitting your existing role and making any uncomfortable change is off the table    addiction and excuses
  thats just a conspiracy nothing made by a large corporation can be bad
  im currently looking for a property to buy in a state that doesnt limit rainwater collection and preferably with good net metering services im probably going to wait until the new rectenna solar panels come to the market before i install solar and at least 24 hours of energy storage but im going to begin building an aquaponic facility as soon as i can electric cars are on the list but gasoline will be available for quite a while so they arent very high on the list ill also need to either build some type of defense or find a way to hide my resources but thats only useful once i have the resources to protect and it makes you look super crazy to stockpile guns and shit    if i can get a business loan for it i also want to buy a plot of land to build grid storage under solar panels but thats more of an attempt to curtail emmisions rather then in preparation for food riots
  wut
  seems reasonable the whole if it bleeds it leads attitude of the media is definitely a huge problem  im curious though are climate scientists generally aware of other factors stressing our ecosystems and food supplies like the rapid dying off of insects birds and fish over the past half century soil depletion desertification and a number of other issues   im asking because the problems we face are very interdisciplinary and im somewhat concerned that any one issue may just end up being the straw that breaks the camels back when it comes to ecosystem or food supply collapse can we even evaluate all the the problem as a whole if scientist are in effect specialists that focus their view in their own bubbles
  im sorry about your reading comprehension      implying defense isnt a part of preparing for an a collapse of civilization  inferring what wasnt implied
  nah petm is way beyond my expertise because theres no ice core from that age 55ma that survive the oldest ice core we have is 3ma from my colleague john higgins at princeton  but people havent heard updates since the article came out because the ice core is a folded discontinuous mess with fucked up co2 value at the bottom because of bacterial respiration    the common theory is that its from destabilization of marine clathrate causing excursion in d13c relative abundance of 13c/12c isotopologues in carbonate sediments because marine clathrate has very depleted d13c however it is not clear why it only happened once and did not happen again another out of the ass hypothesis is that comet striking antarctica at 55 ma antarctica was permafrost just like northern canada and siberia getting hit by a comet would cause rapid release of c from permafrost and continuous fire that burn for years however the evidence if any of this hypothesis will be buried under 34km of modern antarctic ice sheet and incredibly hard to get
  im sorry about your reading comprehension  you think that was clever and snarky but it wasnt
   defense isnt a part of preparing for an a collapse of civilization  implying im not prepping for your defense  along with my buddies in the state department ive installed a tracking device in every mre and box of 762 rounds ever produced you wont be able to hide from us and its kinda cute you think we dont know exactly where your stockpile is our plan is to quietly arrest most of you guys before tshtf and redistribute your stuff to black people
  interesting concept how large of a property do you think youll need for this
  by the way make sure to wait to get the batteries as were expected to get solid state batteries by 2020 which have way higher energy density than current ones plus they wear slower
  are climate scientists generally aware of other factors stressing our ecosystems and food supplies like the rapid dying off of insects birds and fish over the past half century soil depletion desertification and a number of other issues  im asking because the problems we face are very interdisciplinary and im somewhat concerned that any one issue may just end up being the straw that breaks the camels back when it comes to ecosystem or food supply collapse can we even evaluate all the the problem as a whole if scientist are in effect specialists that focus their view in their own bubbles    not exactly i tend to stay in my own bubble as physical climate scientists and most people do even the ipcc report is written piecewise by different people and stapled together because they want to show scientist from hundreds of countries wrote the report theres a little bit of affirmative action going on and youll see that some chapter reads really well while other chapter reads like esl garbage this is not to cast aspersion on scientists from developing countries it is just their writing skills are not up to snuff     with regards to biological system were going beyond exact physics based models conservation of momentum energy chemistry into inexact empirical model predator prey equation on physical science basis we still cannot model cloud formation atmospheric chemistry that is catalyzed by lightning n fixation which determine how much primary nutrient will be available propagating the uncertainties in the physical model into biological systems plus adding uncertainties from the inexact empirical nature of biological systems i think would not be worthwhile endeavor because the uncertainties would be too big and the result would be meaningless
  this is not to cast aspersion on scientists from developing countries it is just their writing skills are not up to snuff  i should probably clarify i meant their writing skills specifically in english they could be some chinese wisdom sun tzu poet in their native tongue but sometime their english writing skill can make your eyes bleed
  sorry i couldnt be bothered to hold your hand while you wrestle with a post on 4chan      im going to take your things with all my guns and then starve to death when theres no more things to take  solid plan ill use commonly available technologies to build a few traps and automated weapons come on down and well see how many people it costs you
  depends on how many people i intend to feed and how closed of a system im trying to construct i could probably support myself and my nuclear family on at least an acre but i want as much land as i can reasonably buy
  is there anything about the recent ipcc report you disagree with are there any important factors they didnt include maybe because they cant be modeled well enough    with regards to biological system  so basically we dont know and theres no reliable way to know im increasingly getting the sense that theres truly no one at the helm of this ship and we just have to hope were lucky enough not to hit any of the larger icebergs
  thats good news hopefully those panels will be on the market by then too
  sorry i couldnt be bothered to hold your hand while you wrestle with a post on 4chan  very smart much condescend real btfo ego critical
  ill use commonly available technologies to build a few traps and automated weapons  implying we havent built remotely operated failsafes into any weapon you could have bought   besides you havent got the guts to kill people we do psychometry tests on all those under surveillance and 99 are wishful thinkers
  we do psychometry tests on all those under surveillance  pretty shit surveillance if you didnt notice my tinfoil hat    checkmate cia
  so basically we dont know and theres no reliable way to know  yeah biology is like the three headed stepchild of climate science because how quantitatively inexact they are imagine youre studying bugs in harvard forest and this bug is particularly important in the ecosystem you publish a study that the population bugs in harvard forest are declining    the logical follow up question would be yeah but how much of that is driven by climate change how can you possibly quantify this well the answer is that you need model population model driven by climate variables in control experiment you model what if the climate is not warming and in your testing hypothesis you model the population with climate forcing sadly the state of science is not quite there yet and the climate models are imprecise for such regional scale so what happen in reality is that you publish a story about bugs declining in harvard forest might or might not be due to climate change people say cool story bro and it gets ignored in the ipcc forecast    are there any important factors they didnt include maybe because they cant be modeled well enough  yeah obviously for example all the cmip5 runs climate model intercomparison project 5 for the ar5 report did not include permafrost feedback the global greening vegetation model clm45 community land model does not include nutrient limitation there are tons of shortcomings in ipcc models but it is easier for me whos not a full time climate modeler to poke holes at them than the people who actually write the code line by line
  its notoriously difficult to educate the plebs    athey dont really care and their eyes glaze over when you attempt to explain the details  bmost simply dont have the capacity to understand anyway    the powers that be have selected a simple slogan to drive the point the earth is getting warmer because of co2 and we are going to need a lot of money to stop it    truth is the rich and powerful dont really care if they manage to convince us but they are obligated to make an attempt see all of them have tickets to a vault you and i well who cares about us    so the reality is that climate change is real a large portion of that change is a direct result of deforestation co2 emissions urban sprawl and other industrial and agriculural influences    highly probable that there are also underlying natural causes beyond our control    why confuse stupid people why even bother trying to explain it all when you have a ticket to a vault    who the fuck is going to agree to pay to get us out of this mess
  people dont realize you can use radio waves to assess someones sweat glands and their content further inferring their emotional state using two wifi routers you can estimate heart rhythm as well    there are methods for galvanic skin resistance heart rate and others    link so your training doesnt interfere with uptake of new information dont worry your masters say its allowed to know and talk about it
  this is a gross oversimplification obviously since insolation at 65n has a much much higher frequency than glacial cycles
  they built underground cities into the mountains we completed ours in the ozarks china hs theirs theres one in russia    were disposable cattle on all levels and in all scenarios
  they got unlimited nutrient  and water and the temperature was nice too
  what do you think is inside the tinfoil peel it apart and youll see all the equipment
  ipcc  so would it be fair to say that the conclusions such as we have 12 years to make huge changes or things get real bad are a whole lot less certain than people think they are    would you say the ipcc generally underestimates the dangers/levels of change were facing or overestimates them assuming you can even answer a question like this
  this is a gross oversimplification obviously since insolation at 65n has a much much higher frequency than glacial cycles    yes this is a well known problem in paleoclimate community known as the 100kyr problem  summer insolation at 65n oscillates every 23kyr but deglaciation only occur every 100125kyr so 4 or 5 precessional cycles there are multiple hypothesis floated up such that you need northern hemisphere ice sheet to be at a certain threshold mass for it to be able to significantly affect the thermohaline circulation warm antarctica and allow the southern ocean to exhale co2
  hit by a comet  funny i was taught while studying marine geography that petm was caused either via methane clathrate mass release or via bolid impact however my lecturers didnt even mention the impact couldve induced methane eruptions thank you for reply
  thanks for clarifying
  so would it be fair to say that the conclusions such as we have 12 years to make huge changes or things get real bad are a whole lot less certain than people think they are    that particular report is based on simple models on the atmospheric lifetime of ghg like co2 which stays on the atmosphere for 100200 years the idea is that what we do now have long term impact then the model is coupled with very simple economic model like peak oil curve suggesting how much you can feasibly cut out after the peak     i dont know the nuts and bolts of the models but funnily long term climate projection is more precise because you weed out all the internal and decadal variability i think the assessment that peak co2 emissions from developed countries needs to be by 2030 and peak co2 emissions from developing country needs to happen by 2050 has a lot of merit to prevent 45c warming by 2100     if youre only talking about temperature warming and ghg emissions then it is a simple physical climate model however how bad things will get if 45c warming occurred by 2100 is uncertain and that number 45c warming is fairly arbitrary because there are plenty feedback mechanism that is unaccounted for     i suspect theyre working backwards from the economic model and see that the most realistic cuts people can make will result in 45c warming so theyre setting the 45c warming as an arbitrary goal that is somewhat achievable similar to peoples target on their personal weight loss it is not realistic to hope to cut 100lbs in 1 month but it is realistic to cut 12lbs per week with 500 calorie deficit every day so people settle on the achievable goal
  45c  holy crap didnt they say that 2c was going to have catastrophic implications would limiting to 45c even be easier on the environment than just not cutting at all
  the common baseline is with respect to preindustrial so were already 12c in the bag and 2c is inevitable even if we stop all emissions today because of the lag in the climate system and thermal inertia of the planet 45c is the paris goal and 25c is the pie in the sky goal of massive reduction in co2 emissions    the idea behind the 12 year limit for developed countries is that if the us and europe doesnt have their peak co2 emissions by 2030 then following fairness argument leading by examples etc developing countries like china and india cannot possibly have peak emissions by 2050     personally i think paris agreement is kinda dumb and only results from bunch of diplomat smelling their own farts because it is nonbinding and there is no consequences people give shit on trump for pulling out of paris but europe is nowhere near close to their emission goal methane emissions in particular is almost an order of magnitude off than their goal the only country that is actively trying with carbon tax is france and theyre having riots in paris because peoples short term livelihood are severely affected by macrons carbon tax    theres not a whole lot of individuals like you and me can do because there are 7 billion people in the planet just sit back and see what happens you can cut on your personal carbon emissions by eating less meat driving less and vote green party not that your vote on the green party will matter then when shit happens you can brag that it is not your fault you did your part
   based on simple models on the atmospheric lifetime of ghg like co2 which stays on the atmosphere for 100200 years    so it doesnt take into account things like albedo changes the acceleration of methane outgasing when lakes form on the permafrost     whats the potential for feedback mechanisms or forcings that we arent yet aware of     funnily long term climate projection is more precise because you weed out all the internal and decadal variability  sure but wouldnt you expect the long term accuracy to be reduced if positive feedback mechanisms are left out of the models
  my god  tfw you are a cia sleeper sent to spy on yourself by means of a mindreading device inside a resonator placed around your skull
  its fun how it only works as an argument in the other direction  its so warm this month  definitely because of climate change  its so cold this month  wow bigot this has nothing to do with global warming we should coin a term for people like you something like holocaust denier just with climate you are a climate denier you should be put into a labor camp to better yourself    its really just this propagandist shit that i have a hard time believing in climate change
  tamino has shown that temperatures spikes equivalent to what were seeing now would show in marcotts curve if they existed     its a fair comparison although not particularly robust
  albedo is accounted for of because it is part of physical feedback but the ice sheets are modeled just as static dumb ice cube that will melt given how much heat in the system they do not include positive feedback such as marine ice sheet instability  where west antarctica is currently sitting at a bedrock below sea level so accelerated ocean warming will create a vicious cycle that erodes the ice sheet from below it is easier to melt an ice cube if you put it in a glass of water conduction than if you just leave it out in the counter radiation     methane permafrost feedbacks are not accounted because it is biological system to properly model the permafrost feedback you need to model hydrology soil moisture bacterial community topography which area will have bad drainage and turned into lakes full of rotting organic material that produce methane which area will just drain out and become dry inert soil to do so you have to run climate models coupled to permafrost land models and it is very computationally expensive not to mention there are tons of uncertainties associated with the physical process on permafrost melting i just mentioned     however remember theres also stabilizing feedback that is not accounted for such as in warmer world there will likely be more moisture in the air and hence more cloud increasing the amount of albedo because either feedbacks are very complex people just spit on their hand figuratively and assume those feedback balances out and use the simple bare physics model to project future climate conditions
  i had winter so climate change isnt real  legit 80iq nigger
  the blog misses the point it is not about monte carlo perturbation it is about running a smoothed averaging window over your temperature reconstruction if the guy perturb then averages his temperature data over 120yr window he will see a much smaller signal     you want compare apple to apple so you either average the modern dataset with 120yr moving average or show the unaveraged monte carlo result from shauns reconstruction
  i mean overall temperatures are increasing one cold month means nothing you wouldnt think that one cold day in a week when every other day is above 90f means that the week is cold just because the temperatures are increasing doesnt mean winter goes away
  just sit back and see what happens you can cut on your personal carbon emissions by eating less meat driving less and vote green party not that your vote on the green party will matter then when shit happens you can brag that it is not your fault you did your part    feelsweirdman  
  what a bunch of absolute nonsense i cant believe youre actually getting paid for this so much bullshit and your confidence reading it makes me sad
  t brainlet
  no really maybe youd like to clarify some of the things youve said we can start with the 100200 years statement if you like
  im not a climate scientist but even i understand what hes saying youre just trying to discredit him because you dont like what youre hearing
  given all these uncertainties concerning feedbacks are you concerned about various tipping point scenarios where positive feedbacks cause a runaway warming that we cant do anything to stop short of massive and uncertain geoengineering projects or is notion that were going to be alright if we limit emissions to x amount of tonnes on pretty solid footing    how do you react when you see someone online saying something like its the sun stupid and acting like climate scientists arent aware of the most obvious factors influencing the earths heat balance    would you say that a lot of climate scientists are maybe a little overcautions when it comes to making predictions given how much of a political hotbutton issue this is
  its actually 10002000 years jackass even i know that i cant even be bothered outlining all the other retarded shit he has said no doubt another french canadian diversity hire
  well if you can thoughtfully disprove climateanon go right ahead until then youre just a salty shitposter spewing stuff without any backing
  if you dont believe me then googe co2 residence time you fucking idiot    maybe you just feel inclined to believe all his bullshit because it fits with your liberal ideology
  or is notion that were going to be alright if we limit emissions to x amount of tonnes on pretty solid footing  no as i mentioned theyre likely working backwards from the economic models 45c is achievable economically so lets settle on that without regards to the positive feedback the tipping point if it exist is incredibly uncertain     how do you react when you see someone online saying something like its the sun stupid and acting like climate scientists arent aware of the most obvious factors influencing the earths heat balance  nah i dont care about what most people think public opinion has no bearing on policy i commend my colleagues who work so hard on scicomm but their work are unfortunately inconsequential most americans and majority of nra members support reasonable gun control but even after elementary school kids get shot up there is no gun laws passed most europeans accept the basis of climate change and reasonably well informed and even then they cannot get their shit together and having riots about carbon tax in paris as we speak    would you say that a lot of climate scientists are maybe a little overcautions when it comes to making predictions  i think it is more because we lack the ability to make such prediction and it is hard to communicate uncertainties to the public for example lets say we have coupled permafrost feedbackclimate model that run on black magic quantum computer if we know things for certain then people will be vocal about it but in reality we really dont however most scientists understand their own uncertainties within their own field and dont feel comfortable communicating said uncertainties because limited public attention span therefore youre left with people like michael mann and gavin schmitt who are so sure about their own convictions and almost borderline as politicians to communicate climate science to the public
    im sorry you feel this way anons your thoughts are dully noted but im afraid ill have to believe the poster that has at least provided some form of cohesive argument
  co2 residence time is about 100200 yr     if you believe it is 4 years then you might be thinking of this meme paper     that somehow passes peer review because the guy nominated his friend as referee and the editor was sleeping on his job the paper got rebutted and btfo so hard by   
  did you even bother googling co2 residence time  im guessing not youd prefer to just believe whatever the fuck you want i guess btw im not even here to deny climate change as you seem so wont to assume
  the beauty of it is once we activate the array youll round each other up and help us build communism
  read 
  i said its 10002000 years not 4 and most research agrees    anyway its obviously more complicated than just x  of years because the rate of drawdown changes and is really unknown something you seem all too happy to just gloss over
  yeah 100200 yr is a simplification because there are multiple processes at multiple timescale at play     david archer wrote on this  and quote    a mean atmospheric lifetime of order 104 years is in start contrast with the popular perception of several hundred year lifetime for atmospheric co2 in fairness if the fate of anthropogenic carbon must be boiled down into a single number for popular discussion then 300 years is a sensible number to choose because it captures the behavior of the majority of the carbon a single exponential decay of 300 years is arguably a better approximation than a single exponential decay of 30000 years if one is forced to choose    for the simplicity of discussion i used the 100200yr in line with his 300yr rather than going into all the ocean carbonate balance sequestration and silicate weathering feedbacks
  such as in warmer world there will likely be more moisture in the air and hence more cloud  maybe youd like to provide a source for this as well then  or was that statement for simplicity too
  the quote didnt work as well he meant     a mean atmospheric lifetime of order 104 years is in start contrast with the popular
  also it would be smart to take papers with these kinds of graphs in them with a huge grain of salt because they rely on so many ridiculous assumptions regarding future land use and oceanic conditions
  45 c lol rip to the amphibians fish and pollinators thats so fucking bad
  sure say what you want about richard lindzen being climate skeptic and cigarette smoking apologist but his iris hypothesis is real     this is the latest major paper on the debate    finally the negative relationship between precipitation efficiency and cirrus fraction tends to correspond to a low global equilibrium climate sensitivity in the models in the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 this suggests that tropical anvil cirrus clouds exert a negative climate feedback in strong association with precipitation efficiency     my point is that cloud feedbacks are not taken into account in the long term projection and cloud feedbacks are cited as one of the major potential stabilizing feedback to balance positive feedbacks also not accounted in the bare physics long term projections
  dont worry anon by that point well have fished most things into extinction
  but clouds depend on upwards motion mainly and that is conserved no matter how warm it is so i dont buy it  ill check the links later gtg
  therefore youre left with people like michael mann and gavin schmitt who are so sure about their own convictions and almost borderline as politicians to communicate climate science to the public  is there anyone out there that does a good job communicating without going beyond what the science actually says you mentioned pieter tans    have you or are you planning on taking any actions in your personal life based on your knowledge or suspicions of our future such as moving to a region which wont be as heavily impacted
  communications come at sizeable opportunity cost to be a shitposting loudmouth like michael mann on twitter takes out of your time from your research there are plenty less ideological people in climate science but a lot of them dont want to deal with the shitposting and shitflinging against climate deniers also im personally skeptical about the importance of public opinion as you can see specifically american politics is completely decoupled from public opinion the afghanistan war has like 6 approval but were still there on behalf of defense contractors im talking to you guys on indonesian basket weaving imageboard because im also comfily shitposting with regards to neil degrasse tyson sexual misconduct on the other thread    have you or are you planning on taking any actions in your personal life based on your knowledge or suspicions of our future such as moving to a region which wont be as heavily impacted  see  just sit back and see what happens you can cut on your personal carbon emissions by eating less meat driving less and vote green party not that your vote on the green party will matter then when shit happens you can brag that it is not your fault you did your part    i dont live in a climate hotspot region and im upper middle class in developed country so ill be fine
  taking serbian climate research as factual
  im well aware of how decoupled public opinion is form politics im also aware of how much fake news and bullshit there is on every side of most issues   im not looking to make a difference or to convince anyone im looking to get a reasonable overview of the issues make appropriate plans for the future if necessary   in any case this has been very enlightening i didnt know much of anything about the uncertainties involved so thanks for that
  well as first order advice the smart thing to do is to not follow advice from anonymous imageboard    for all you know i could be a shitposting retard pretending to know what im talking about like the qanon phenomena obviously im not as i tried to answer most questions as honest as i can and feel free to check my answers against all the published literature but youll never know
  im looking for advice to think about not to follow if you are larping or shitposting youre doing a pretty convincing job though
  thats some hard btfo right there any comment on that  
  the climate changes naturally therefore humans did it
  post proof you are a climate scientist i am a climate scientist and you are full of shit
  my feelings are mod important than the data reeeeeeeeeeee  woah there sjw
  the discussion then boils down to how much of modern climate change is manmade this question lack the specifics     its pretty specific give me a percent of what is natural and what is man made     in terms of what global temperature wildfires hurricane sea ice ice sheet size theres different level of anthropogenic footprint and uncertainties in each of those variables    isnt this what the government is paying you to research are you claiming this is too hard because if you cant tell me how much of our man made climate change is created by say the wildfires in california or the coal plants in china what are you being paid to figure out    step 1 you claim there is a large problem caused by humans step 2 you get more money from the government to research this step 3 you use this money to prove theres a larger problem than you initially claimed if you found there was no problem what would happen to the money you get step 4 you get more money to prove theres a larger problem step 5 repeat this cycle until the overpopulation hysteria oh sorry were over that one arent we step 5 repeat this cycle until the global warming hysteria is so played out that even the government wont pay you    the effect of climate change regardless it is anthropogenic or not will predominantly be negative because resource redistribution creates instability in socioeconomic system    at least youre honest if man made climate change was an actual problem scientists would be working on new systems to correct it its not actually a problem but it is hugely profitable why do actual research in dangerous locales when you can sit in front of a computer create simulations with fatally incomplete data sets and then claim the sky is falling and anyone who questions why you get paid so much and why we should be taxed for something we cant measure gets pointed at and accused of being antiscience    fuck your hysteria and your greed
  post proof you are a climate scientist i am a climate scientist and you are full of shit  post proof  no u
  i think youre misinterpreting marcotts methodology it doesnt use a running average or a smoothed averaging window of 120 years what it averaged were simulations the 120 years is the median resolution of the proxies that were used tamino claims in the comments to the blog post that the use of many proxies together gives a net temporal resolution much finer than 120 years
  i dont live in a climate hotspot region and im upper middle class in developed country so ill be fine  well unless of course the cost of living goes up or something geopolitically changes because of climate change in some other focal point in the global chessboard which you a climate scientist cant know about why do you think youll be ok in say 40 years when youre presumably in your midlate 60s i dont know why everyone just seems to not care about their kids unless you dont want any in which case youre sort of part of the larger problem that leads to things like people thinking we can stay on coal for another century and pretending that there is no consensus about agw
  the 120yr running average is inherent in the proxies that they used for a fair comparison apple to apple you need to turn the annual temperature measurement also into proxy with 120yr running average    the blog is talking about slightly different thing read it carefully would a present day temperature spike show up in marcott et al temperature stack absolutely tamino is right nobody doubted that    what im saying strictly refer to presentation slapping a curve with annual resolution at the end of curve with inherent 120yr smoothing average is at best sloppy and at worst dishonest because youre seeing a much higher rate of warming on the curve with annual resolution    even with 120yr average present day anthropogenic temperature spike would still show up at the end of the curve theres no reason to exaggerate the spike by showing two curves with inherently different time resolution
  let me rephrase that i will not do worse than my peers within the same income level and background where i live when everyone becomes poorer then nobody becomes poorer because poor is relative
  jesus christ youre a moron arguing x  y is false is not equivalent to arguing x  y its equivalent to arguing x  y
    the 120yr running average is inherent in the proxies that they used  what specifically does that mean saying that the proxies have a 120 year running average doesnt necessarily mean the reconstruction does 120 years is not the actual resolution of the graph and its the graph that is being compared to the temperature record not a particular proxy as far as i can tell the only mention of 120 years is the median resolution of the proxies used not a running average and not the resolution of the reconstruction
  putting them as equivalent forces  yeah youre the retard
high voltage power lines are altering the ionosphere and its electron rain
  they arent equivalent anthropogenic forcing is currently much stronger than natural forcing
  when everyone becomes poorer absolutely no one becomes poorer  yes i too am capable of speaking like a politician or media goblin when sufficiently flustered or disinterested in honesty     pivoting away from your good humor you do realize that your skills will likely decline in value even disregarding the impending economic catastrophes that certainly await all of us again also not even taking into consideration effects from climate change on the economy and global wealth
  its pretty specific give me a percent of what is natural and what is man made   change in surface temperature since 1950 attribution    natural approximately 10    manmade approximately 110    source ipcc ar5 105    step 1 you claim there is a large problem caused by humans step 2 you get more money from the government to research this step 3 you use this money to prove theres a larger problem than you initially claimed if you found there was no problem what would happen to the money you get step 4 you get more money to prove theres a larger problem step 5 repeat this cycle until the overpopulation hysteria oh sorry were over that one arent we step 5 repeat this cycle until the global warming hysteria is so played out that even the government wont pay you  the same conspiracy theory could be claimed for any science you wish to deny too bad you actually have to prove it    if man made climate change was an actual problem scientists would be working on new systems to correct it  you already have the solution emit less co2
  volcanoes are about 1 so of course youre boot licking them  
  not that your vote on the green party will matter  tbf your choice to eat less meat and drive less wont matter either
  
isnt it weird that of all the things in science global warming is the one science that catches shit i mean i get why evolution is denied burn climate change    what
  if we build a greenhouse and increase co2 concentrations to 20 do we see heat increases in the greenhouse     just curious because of another experiment with a greenhouse built with glass that blocks certain radiation frequencies that still showed the same heating inside as if it were regular glass due to heat vortexes not being hindered inside
  im sure it would be better for them to write in their native language so you cant understand it at all broken english isnt a sign of affirmative action its bilingual adults talking down to the monolingual babies for the latters benefit
  yes check out youtube for some demonstrations of co2 as a greenhouse gas and youll understand why
  its because the issue has been stacked with politics both sides are guilty of it
  both sides are guilty  oh bs
  yeah like how the climate scientists faked results since they get funding if they make it look scarier than it is money explains everything i agree with you
  makes up bullshit on image boards  great argument
  just like you did shitstain you arent better than anyone grow up
  claim well be underwater in 10 years for 20 years  no weve never made exaggerated or dishonest claims stop being antiscience
  fuck you
  hey im generating climate data from the holocene optimum we have very interesting results
    and eat my dick
  citation needed
  sadfart  while youre at it give us some oldfucks quotes too
    and where is you smart arsed response to this   now you arrogant pigfuck
  literally a citation one post before yours      i dont know what youre saying      the fact remains that co2 is actually really weak as a greehouse gas and is less of the atmosphere than water vapor is co2 is about 3 of the atmosphere h2o is about 14 of the atmosphere and h2o is 3 times more effective as a greenhouse gas than co2 is    so i wouldnt say that co2 is particularly important info in regards to climate change
    well thats simply because you are an uneducated ignorant fucking peasant who has no place voicing his retarded opinion in any serious discussion on this topic understood good now go back to reconditioning the engine in your lawn mower
  co2 is about 3 of the atmosphere  whoops  co2 is about 04 of the atmosphere  my b
  foxnews  breitbart are worthless cult rags  into the trash it goes
  says the fucker denying that theres conspiracies involved in this   get some self awareness
  breitbart
  they are dishonest 1 puppets  you get more useful info from a used tp  
  the fact remains that co2 is actually really weak as a greehouse gas  what does really weak mean it has the effect its measured to have    and is less of the atmosphere than water vapor is co2 is about 3 of the atmosphere h2o is about 14 of the atmosphere and h2o is 3 times more effective as a greenhouse gas than co2 is  this is all irrelevant since the problem is not the total greenhouse effect of the total atmosphere which keeps the earth from being 0 degrees f the problem is the change in the greenhouse effect since the industrial revolution which has caused the temperature to rise rapidly water vapor changes in response to changes in temperature its not a forcing    any time someone starts talking about the percentage of the atmosphere or the percentage of the total greenhouse effect you know they have no idea what theyre talking about
  i never fucking mentioned the shit heads at fox  keep putting up the strawmen if it makes you feel good
  theyre both the same shit
  cant make specific predictions about how peoples lives will be affected  global climate related armageddon that youve been harping on for decades still hasnt happened  if scientists describe a specific physical phenomena like co2 trapping heat ill take their word for it the argument earlier in this thread that there will be a nonnegligible economic cost to transitioning what particular regions are used for seems plausible    but my life consistently stays better than people pushing for climate legislation keep telling me it will therefore im going to assume theyre charlatans who are trying to push uncertain worst case scenarios as undeniable fact for political reasons
  makes up shit about other people making up shit on 4chan threads   great argument
  specific predictions  at 450ppm/2c 5075 of rain in subtropics 4023 lat will fail at current rate thatll happen around 2030
  cant make specific predictions about how peoples lives will be affected  because people are complicated and change what theyre doing based on a number of factors asking climatologists to accurately predict economic and sociatal changes is dumb    global climate related armageddon that youve been harping on for decades still hasnt happened  stop reading shitty newspapers scientists arent predicting armageddon    but my life consistently stays better than people pushing for climate legislation keep telling me it will  stop making vague claims provide a specific example    therefore im going to assume theyre charlatans who are trying to push uncertain worst case scenarios as undeniable fact for political reasons  yes scientists all over the planet are collaborating together to fake an entire field of research in order to harm us politics that makes sense
  i dont read anything that wasnt approved by a centralist truth authority  if huffpost doesnt write about something its not real  this board i swear
  you dont have to be here you can always go back to /pol/
  nazi rags just dont count  so fuck off
  asking climatologists to accurately predict economic and sociatal changes  im not doing that im asking people trying to pass laws which manipulate society and the economy to predict economic and societal changes    scientists arent predicting armageddon  politicians should stop telling me scientists told them were doomed unless i vote for them then    stop making vague claims provide a specific example  i dont keep records of every time a politician threatens me but my life is fine and i know theyve been telling me my life wont be fine in 510 years for a long time when my life stops being fine or they can point out definite signs that my life will soon not be fine they might earn my trust back    scientists all over the planet are collaborating together to fake an entire field of research in order to harm us politics  no but us politicians are cherrypicking predictions in order to trick me into giving them money and firing up their pseud supporters who want to feel superior about their choice of authority figure
  then stop listing to politicians and blaming scientists for what they say
  i dont this whole time ive been talking about people pushing for climate legislation i never said anything negative about scientists    my main point is just that i disagree with that guy who said only one side is politicizing the issue people stop trusting everything you say if you say enough wrong things to them and thats what happened here    also most people do believe in humans contributing to climate change now but thats not the same thing as believing historical liars when they tell you how bad the consequences will be if you dont vote for them this time
im quite conservative minded and i hate political correctness  i dont deny climate change and im not religious  im not a nazi either
  if you dont trust the reporting of a conservative rag with a track record of literally fabricating stories then youre basically an authoritarian drone from the ministry of truth here to silence dissent  commit kakuro crayonmuncher
  big oil companies have objectively and provably been supporting climate change propaganda for the past thirty years your graphic is inherently wrong just from this alone  its so funny when people think they are fighting big oil by supporting green energy big energy makes the most money of anyone off of green energy and always has
  just a little over 10 years in the future just like all the other things that didnt happen but didnt matter because you already cashed in 10 years before and people got scared of the next boogeyman
  big energy makes the most money of anyone off of green energy and always has  go home anon youre drunk
  big oil companies have objectively and provably been supporting climate change propaganda for the past thirty years  by funding heartland and friends      just like all the other things that didnt happen  and yet you cant name one
  our cities still arent underwater the ice caps are still there
  do you have any source for those predictions other than your ass i mean
  so youre going to just make things up

  /threading your own post  cancer  but you are right      maybe you have selective memory  or maybe your fancy charts are wrong lmao
  they always mention water vapor when their argument is falling apart
  you clearly havent paid any attention to big oil and big energy and where their money is spent  now ten years old ecomagination has generated more than 200 billion in revenues since inception today ge is expanding the program with eight partnerships seeking to solve looming environmental and sustainability challenges in ways that make economic sense  thats 2000000000000 usd revenue a year every year for a decade straight  youre a useful idiot lining big energys pockets
  general electric a company which primarily manufactures electric infrastructure has a renewable electricity division  gasp wow this changes everything you sure showed me that big oil is making up global warming
  it wouldnt surprise me they also own the companies that get called in for pipeline leaks oil spills and so on sucking up federal and state subsidies in the process    whats one more layer
hi guys climate scientist here im back the discussion on modern climate change is honestly boring and has been repeated ad nauseum any questions on past climate and earth system dynamics or ice cores that you guys wanted ill be more than happy to answer the best i can
  the idea that the same banking / corporate / government cabal that caused this fucking mess can fix everything with a price on carbon is absolutely absurd
  a while ago one of your friends grad students was asking about the climate during the eocene and if its in our future i responded that it was unlikely because we wont have the same jungles pumping water into the atmosphere any comment
  well water vapor is a function of temperature and temperature only following clausius clayperon equation so it doesnt really matter how much water vapor and how much mechanisms there is to add/remove water vapor from the atmosphere so water vapor is a feedback amplifier and not really a forcing in itself during the eocene since neither of the ice sheets antarctica greenland existed itll probably help to have more forest area for carbon drawdown if the initial methane clathrate destabilization did indeed occur however sea level was also much higher and as a result there is way less land area in the tropics indonesia the 2nd largest present day rainforest after brazil for example would be almost completely underwater so im not quite sure how much more effective the terrestrial c pump was back then compared to the more recent quarternary period im not an expert in geologic timescale but if i had to guess i would say it is about the same as the more recent drawdown capacity
  can you show me the effect of light and heat through our airground level vs co2 depleted air
  experimentally
  no im not an experimental physicists i dont even know what you meant by experimentally like do you expect me to set up an infrared absorption experiment for you     all i know is the very basic theoretical climate science 101 blackbody earth  1 layer 2 layer atmosphere model 
  i just wanna see data sheets for comparisons
  just because something happened naturally doesnt mean that its the only way it can happen  it would be like saying selective breeding couldnt cause changes in animal populations because evolution via natural selection does it to
    
  somebody hacked the climate scientists  somehow this makes the scientists the bad guys  how do we know the denialists werent the perpetrators hmmm
does science recognize the existence of aliens i know there is a good chance they exist just out of probability but is there any concrete evidence personally i think astrobiology is just a branch of cryptozoology
  personally i think astrobiology is just a branch of cryptozoology  t brainlet who doesnt understand statistics
  like i said i understand their likeliness of existence due to probability but gigantopithicus crossing the bering strait into north america isnt exactly impossible either where is the physical evidence
no i dont
science is aliens wake up sheeple
  there is no concrete evidence
  what about us  we exist thats concrete
  and every evidence will be given different explanations than that we are not alone
  those numbers are pure bullshit and sucked out of somebodys ass
  i dont think there are any multicellular aliens out there
  rare earth hypothesis
  so the development of multicellular life on earth was a statistical impossibility that happened anyway
  i hope they exist cant wait to have my very own alien gf
  where is the physical evidence  theyre looking   weve only started to reliably detect exoplanets very recently the trick now is to find one with the signs of life in its atmosphere   assuming you dont find it on europa enceladus or somewhere else in the solar system   if you can verify its life with an independent origin from us and not cross contamination between the planets then you can make an assumption that the universe should be lousy with life at some level if it managed to happen twice in the same system
sci what is causing insects to die    if it is pesticides why is it happening everywhere and not only where pesticides are used    its so quiet outside 
  pesticides mostly
  the increasing overabundance of electromagnetic fields probably
  winter
  we have loads of evidence that elf including power frequency fields harm insects and a good deal of research has shown why other frequencies scramble their behavior and kill them off    but anything but my wifi and cell phone right my smart meter i have to go up against them to save the world best keep looking a more convenient cause    prove my bitterness wrong by consulting the literature and seeing the truth these fields also alter microorganism activity and compromise what are otherwise mutualistic etc behaviors
  and in the real world its pesticides
  they play a role but theyre not the whole picture    sorry the world isnt precisely as simple as you always thought it was
  the day of the raid has come you filthy insect lover  spray the roaches species war now
  sci what is causing insects to die  winter comes about this time ever year
  if i was a biotechnology guy i would research what youre saying could be fun
  well dont worry ive already researched it a section on insects and broader ecological effects will be included in my next thread on 5g / wireless communication
  we didnt know this would happen crispr is a powerful tool
  sci what is causing insects to die  invasive dark matter frogs
  if it is pesticides why is it happening everywhere and not only where pesticides are used  pesticides travel they get into water evaporate with it and rain on the organic farm down the street poisoned bugs get eaten by raccoons that get run over and feasted on by maggots   lifefinds a way
  haarp
  theres glyphosate in the rain anon
  this and anyone who disagrees needs to google electron rain also look up the work of andrew marino      pretty much affecting the ionosphere can have great effects on local ecologies whether through haarp high voltage power lines etc
  i remember this from the anime jintai
    literally  chemicals in the water are turning the frogs gay
  atrazine    even wikijoke has a section on it youre a literal retarded my dude
  
  youre a literal retarded
    i never understood why this is mocked its an actual issue
  because the cultural narrative is manufactured thats how you control people get them all talking through the same lies as though its what everyone else believes and as though its whats safe to talk about    the other method is getting people to laugh at things theyd ordinarily find horrible and unacceptable this strategy was really pioneered by stuff like the daily show colbert and all of that its meant to defuse tensions make you feel complicit and dirty strip you of your will    the biggest problem is that people refuse to believe that they can be controlled and how easy it is to control things it disturbs and rustles the jimmies of their very soul
  i never understood why this is mocked  because youre dumb xd
  well it definitely works
  yes it does
  insects have always died just like everybody else
  i will watch out for it over on /x/ should be fun
  itll be posted on /sci/
  rain on the organic farm down the street    implying organic farms do not use pesticides    implying i give a shit about the convention of greentexting implications
  its offtopic here    but if you post it where it belongs ill enjoy reading it
  
i thought this was the science board not the politicsfueled conspiracy theory board
  implying journals with positive impact factors belong on /sci/  we only like places we could get published in
  i suspect were at the the point in rf effects where we were with cigarettes in the 60s and fossil fuels a few years ago vehement denial few facts research ridiculed when i was a kid we never heard of autism dunno if it wasnt around or just not diagnosed but i first started hearing of it in common parlance in the late 1980s  when pcs were everywhere and folks were close to crts now we have wifi in our pockets next to our heads multiple sources at work or on public transport not saying theres a correlation but theres a coincidence that could be studied  imagine the horrified response of those who are addicted to technology if their devices proved harmful
  imagine the horrified response of those who are addicted to technology if their devices proved harmful  unfortunately i dont have to because they have and i see it frequently when i break the taboo and tell them all about it i dont just do this on the internet its a full time deal i find the evidence overwhelming i see it everywhere i go and every second of every day and its all very difficult theyve manufactured a cultural framework that makes this all hard to grapple with publicly and having studied decades of history on the matter it becomes ever clearer how and why that came about    this is beyond a nightmare scenario and youre correct in assuming pulsed rf may have a causative role in autism there are a number of mechanistic links concerning the role it plays thats in addition to a high body load of various toxic compounds during fetal and immediate postnatal life early clamping of the placenta esp if its before full lung changeover vaccines another taboo and finally prenatal exposure to rf causing cell death mutation of stem cells and alterations in dendritic spine formation and axonal guidance    the nightmare continues when you consider the mountain of data showing were headed towards mass infertility    concerning the crt aspect when visual display terminals vdts started to be installed in secretarial environments in many instances a massive rise in spontaneous abortion was noted there are also various patents for influencing television viewers through the same mechanism and flicker rate manipulation    what makes it a nightmare is youre walking around in hell and no one else acts like anything is wrong eventually theyll probably drag you to the gallows for telling the truth but for now im doing what i can to inform people
  also worth noting the tobacco industry brought in pr firms like phillipmorris telecom and the epri have done the same which is why the pattern of literature pollution is similarly but due to differences in history the corruption is much deeper and more widespread so those tactics have a more solid base to stand on    refer to ong et al for an overview of that structure
fucking conspirationists ruining this board its mainly pesticides whatever you bayer shills say

why cant geometry be visualized in greater than three dimensions
  it can
no it cant dont even try
visualize a rotating cube that you are watching on a tv in the 3d world
  ii cant do it  wtf
  i can visualize 11 dimensions  most of them are not independent though lol
  biological limitation humans are not general intelligences capable of being or constructing anything we literally cant comprehend it its unnecessary for our world at least our survival within it and possibly too messy/obtuse to have anyway of course you can call anything a dimension but thats probably not what you meant
    that math problem 18 9 is very interesting    cross the 1 out and substituted 1 with a zero and place a 1 in front of the 8 and youre still left with 189    quality meme
  because there are only three physical dimensions there is no fourth or higher dimension that exists its the same as asking why cant we visualize 4 sided triangles
  what are schlegel diagrams
  you cant because the laws of math are based in our 3dimensional universe
because we live in a 3d spatial world and our brains have specialized to this    as wittgenstein said the limits of my language are the limits of my world if we allow for a slightly more abstract interpretation of the word language here
  not true math in r3 can usually be extended to rn trivially    you can for example imagine the projection of a high dimensional object to 12 or 3d even though its a shadow its still 4d or w/e    theres no evidence theres more than 3 spatial dimensions it makes sense then that we perceive 3d best
        brainlets    pic related from based arnolds book
  my eyes hurt
  no brainlet    a triangle is just a name for a 3 sided polygon its like asking why cant we visualize a 4 sided 3 sided polygon thats logically impossible which isnt anything at all like the question of higher dimensions you can extrapolate the existence of higher dimensions by just repeating the pattern that produces 3 dimensions from 2 dimensions 2 dimensions from 1 dimension you can even perform operations on 4 dimensional shapes with math just like any lower dimension shape doesnt mean they are real but you cant rule them out either
  why cant geometry be visualized in greater than three dimensions  what greater than three dimensional geometry
  theres no evidence there is more than 3 spatial dimensions  really only 2 physically relevant dimensions because of the holographic principle a 3rd spatial dimension is redundant in physics
  only 4 spatial dimensions    where do i collect my nobel prize
it can youre doing it all the time
  lol i can do it does that mean im on the spectrum /
  visualising 3d geometry is hard enough most 3 manifolds cant be embedded in r3
daily reminder if you cant do the following you arent going to make a difference to the world  visualize complex 3d objects in mind   rotate resize deform dissolve layers etc   visualize the above happening through time
it depends on the constraints on the dimensional variables a terinary phase diagram allows you to view four variables in a three dimensional graph projected onto a two dimensional space but only because three of the variables are constrained
  string theory  if its correct it still wouldnt prove the dimensionality of a system only that it doesnt matter
  evolution humans evolved in a universe with 3 spatial dimensions so we evolved the ability to visualize in 3d since the world isnt 4d we didnt need to evolve the ability to visualize things in 4d
  the holographic principle  lets see you calculate anything measurable using your meme principle protip you cant holographic dualities are pure math and only amount to speculative / nonpredictive physics
polling /sci/    where do you fall on the autism spectrum  how many dimensions can you think in    high functioning  4d tensors are easy 5d if i try 6 i can understand abstractly but not on the same level
  all of them  t not on the spectrum
can anyone explain this      what is the amount of substance of sodium ion in 20 mol na2so4    im supposed to follow the m  m x n rule i just dont even know where to start with this
m  211432416)))2  theres some rounding in there
  no wait fuck i added the so4 in there too
  what exacly is 211 you had there as well where did the 11 come from i feel more retarded now
  atomic number of na
you got 2 moles of na for every mole of na2so4  thats 4 moles in total  every mole of sodium has a mass of approx 23 grams  you got 92 grams of na
  thank you good man
  those hips  moar
  moar  just come to sweden
  if anybody is still here     calculate the mass of oxygen atom in 5 grams of na2so4    thanks
are there special temp probe inlet adaptors for strong vaccum use that wont leak
  you calculate how much mols is 20 grams then you calculate how much mols of oxygen it is then you multiply it by molar mass of oxygen
  those curves
how do i make planar magnetic drivers why can i not find a single source to buy them directly or instruction to make them
  hm sounds like a good market
    of course you cant perpendicular are better
first of all as far as we are all concerned   everything freaking everything is made ouf of elementary particles thank you physicists    second all circle are part of everything and all circles are made out of elementary particles  finite amount of elementary particles physical observable existences    mathematicians you have a finite  observable object let me emphazise finite how can you turn that into somethign infinite when it observably ends   let me guess the circle you are talking about here is actually a circle but it has actually nothing to do with an actual physical circle because you havent figured out yet that in the physical worlds things actually end
  you can add more energy into a system in order to push the particles closer together making the circle more accurate there is no upper bound to the accuracy it just becomes increasingly infeasible but the behavior of every different circle approaches some ideal form as the accuracy is increased mathematics studies these platonic forms which gives physicists a reference to characterize and study the physical approximates
    are you saying that there are actual empirical experiments done on calculating the pie of a physical circle
    even archimedes had that shit figured out nice dunning kruger though
the mathematical circle is only a generalized abstraction of many other objects that we perceive among them physical circles thanks to the methods of calculus we can obtain arbitrarily good approximations for stuff such as the perimeter or area of any given circle and we are content with such approximations rather than a exact measurement  the fact that all of those approximations rely on the value of pi a trascendental number impossible to determine exactly goes to show that nobody who seriously does math or physics really claims to be able to know the exact area or perimeter of a physical circle  im sure nobody believes there is such a thing as an exact physical circle anyhow
the period of eix is exactly 2pi thats a circle it is a mathematical concept perfect circles do not exist physically with the sole exception of the theoretical spherical event horizon of the black hole in a scwarzschield metric and even then its not really believed there is no quantum uncertainty on the exact position of the horizon
      you two thanks for replies if you are still here i really need to know the answer to this one    let the circle be a mathematical abstraction   even this abstractions circumference must be a distance it has to exist  made out of literally something finite amount of something there is just no justified logic behind your abstract circle and how you abstractly mathematically measure it you dont agree    no numeral can be defined by using itself no such thing as a circle with a circumference of 5 it is always 5 cm s apples kg
  distance isnt quantized    inb4 muh popsci told me planck length is a quantum
    yea lets say a circles circumference is a distance worth x plancks length the diameter is also distance worth y planks length are you stating the x can be divided by y infinitively even if you have a finite amount of distance thats the whole point here       yea archimedes didnt have the standard model though he didnt have the proper understanding of what circles are to fully understand how his math works with actual observed reality
elementary particles are not nice little balls or blocks they are wavey and occupy multiple positions at the same time all matter is like this feeling fucked up yet op
  you can divide a number to infinity and still keep going the planck length is a practical bottom limit for the real world math doesnt have such arbitrary limits ie there is no such thing as the smallest number
  popsci memer argument against maths
    wavey occupy multiple positions at the same time do i feel fucked up na im good just having a giggle at the words you chose to describe elementary particles wavey but not sure what is your point exactly i am fully aware to an extent of the properties of elementary particles but when you know whats up that does make studying the relation of the diameter and circmuference a little bit harder doesnt it since now you are dealing with particles that are wavey and occupy multiple positions at the same time      the planck length a bottom line for the real world math doesnt have to follow the limits of the real world  im really glad to see the same logic from your words so im not the only one here thank you  now mathematicians how about some freaking math that is compatible with reality for once please
  the planck length a bottom line for the real world  citation needed hard mode no popsci  also  
  measurable distance plancks length whatever  why did you just contradict yourself within the first three lines of text in that picture
  go to bed norman wildburger
  he doesnt know the difference between quantized and discretized
the mathematical concept of a circle is a model for circles that are encountered in the physical world no one is saying there is an object in the real world that is equivalent to a conceptual circle we just require that the circle accurately models the relevant physical objects if youre asking whether a circle actually exists and is not just some artificial product of our minds thats a philosophical question see what actual intellectuals have to say about this subject mathematical realism
the universe and its laws are a subset of math in our universe yes infinity does not exist but that still does not mean we should ignore it in math can you not imagine a different universe where planks length is a little smaller math transcends our universe
  why should it be compatible with reality your very arguments show how limiting doing so is
    hey kids i am going to teach you today about circles mathematical circles they are not actually circles but models of observed circles like this circle i will draw now on the board   now dont get confused this is not exactly the circle i am talking about this is just a model of the mathematical circle the mathematical circle does not have any boundaries and therefore i can not model it on the board because it doesnt exist in a form it could be drawn because its infinte this shouldnt be hard you just suck at learning        i can fully understand your points anons the point still being mathematicians and all of us for the love of science want to be as accurate as scientifically possible of course we want our theories models revolving around physics to be as pin point as possible so should the math of it in all aspects     thats the second time you someone is pointing that out yes your circles do not exist in the observed reality the circles mathematicians study do not exist jesus so everyone just stop representing them with drawings of circles since the mathematical circle does not exist it can not be represented modelled with a physical drawing of an observed circle   why do you guys like confusing people especially children     and no i can not imagine a smaller scale than planck length nor can you not even the planck length itself it can not be observed like you can an apple but we can model one it doesnt mean smaller scale than that exists it should be treated as a poor theory of reality as it is
    when you reply something like that how do you expect how do you want the op to react answer to a reply as such just tell me i want to know
  children dont know what a planck length is you fucking autist they understand full well that a circle is a circle and while now i know that we can never make a real circle this doesnt make my conception of the real circle impossible   by your argument every single thing in physics should be quantized pure continuous curves broken up into discrete steps of finite size im sure people learning something as basic as mechanics will appreciate having to consider how parabolic trajectories work in terms of planck length movement
  the planck length is sometimes misconceived as the minimum length of spacetime but this is not accepted by conventional physics as this would require violation or modification of lorentz symmetry however certain theories of loop quantum gravity do attempt to establish a minimum length on the scale of the planck length though not necessarily the planck length itself  get this in your head you fucking retard how many times do we have to repeat this
      yea children do not know what a planck length is and i can mostly certainly state that they also dont know what a circle is either just like with arkhimedes for example these humans have no conceptual idea of a circle  by that i mean what a circle is made out of what physically makes a circle how you interact with the photons that have interacted with the elementary particles that physically make this circle to be observed in the first place that is the circle just recognising the shape is not enough to do math get it     the planck length is not even the point here even if the quantised length was googolplex times shorter its the false model of a circle from the observed reality     the whole point here is you can not get results that are infinite with circles that are physically finite you can not model a circle with an infinite circumference infinite diameter and get a relation of these that is never ending get it how can any mathematician come up with this nonsense and understand the model a circle so fucked uply   i would really like to understand your thought process its just not happening yet enlighten me please
  there is no evidence that space is discrete but even if it were assuming that its continuous works well on larger scales then the models we make can only be applied to those scales every physicist is aware of that fact  if you want to get into the nitty gritty you have to take the discreteness if it exists into account because it becomes important on small scales attempts to do this have been made but none of them was successful and/or made testable predictions    how can any mathematician come up with this nonsense and understand the model a circle so fucked uply  math doesnt exist to describe the real world its much more general some concepts can be used to model the real world but thats just a small subset and yes mathematicians know how to describe discrete objects but nobody successfully applied that to say a theory of spacetime yet
  mathematicians you have a finite  observable object let me emphazise finite how can you turn that into somethign infinite when it observably ends     abstract a simple circle into a simple 3d spring we can actually observe this transition of being a 3d shape to a quasi 2 dimensional circle from most observational patterns of energyparticle physics thus far just pop it open like an accordian spin doesnt even have to occur its merely implied
  mathematicians you have a finite  observable object let me emphazise finite how can you turn that into somethign infinite  pi isnt infinite proof 32  pi  0
anon youre getting lost in the sauce  infinity exists first not the materials that comprise it  the circle is a symbol let it it guide you not frustrate
          jesus guys with all the comprehensions skills i have in english language i can not interpret any of that in anyway that even remotely tries to answer the point im trying to make here _ once more can i even simplify this even further    okay math isnt here to explain the real observed reality   in this math world what your circle made out of   what is the unit the circle in the studies a model of it can not be a cm or any measure of distance that matter for then it would be representation of reality which math is not    did this clarify at all
  the ideal circle is made out of nothing it exists only in the minds of people who think of it unless youre a platonist and think the ideal forms exist somewhere what people are trying to explain is that your request is ridiculous and completely at odds with how mathematics is actually used
    people have told lots of things here  for example   1 that the mathematical circle is a model of the observed physical circle  2 now you are saying the exact opposite that the circle just simply doesnt exist but it exists in our minds    just answer this for the love of science from your own point of view and understanding   how do you study and model the relation of something that doesnt exist that is not an any kind of a unit  to an another something nonunitnonexistent
  uh those two statements are perfectly compatible
    models exist they are physical observable  you are stating they are not want to clarify
  in this math world what your circle made out of  a circle is the set of points in a plane that are equidistant from a given point o the distance r from the center is called the radius and the point o is called the center    a set is a finite or infinite collection of objects in which order has no significance and multiplicity is generally also ignored unlike a list or multiset members of a set are often referred to as elements and the notation a in a is used to denote that a is an element of a set a the study of sets and their properties is the object of set theory    a point is a 0dimensional mathematical object which can be specified in ndimensional space using an ntuple x_1 x_2  x_n consisting of n coordinates    the dimension of an object is a topological measure of the size of its covering properties    topology let x be a set the elements of x are usually called points though they can be any mathematical object we allow x to be empty let n be a function assigning to each x point in x a nonempty collection nx of subsets of x the elements of nx will be called neighbourhoods of x with respect to n or simply neighbourhoods of x the function n is called a neighbourhood topology if the axioms below are satisfied and then x with n is called a topological space    1 if n is a neighbourhood of x ie n  nx))) then x  n in other words each point belongs to every one of its neighbourhoods  2 if n is a subset of x and includes a neighbourhood of x then n is a neighbourhood of x ie every superset of a neighbourhood of a point x in x is again a neighbourhood of x  3 the intersection of two neighbourhoods of x is a neighbourhood of x  4 any neighbourhood n of x includes a neighbourhood m of x such that n is a neighbourhood of each point of m
    i would love to just nod in agreement   a circle is the set of points points that represent what elementary particles points dots what     with pure honest sincerity what is going on  one just tells circles are made ouf of nothing now they are made out of points points what
  a point is a primitive notion upon which the geometry is built meaning that a point cannot be defined in terms of previously defined objects that is a point is defined only by some properties called axioms that it must satisfy in particular the geometric points do not have any length area volume or any other dimensional attribute
  you know there exists a topology that is pointless called frames and locales but the other anon probably doesnt know about it 
  literally pointless
    thank you for the reply starts to make sense     is the the thought process mathematicians have gone through    1 first model a physical circle one you can observe in reality     2 alter the model of the physical observed circle by changing the elementary particles into points     from this we can state that you are not allowed to model a mathematical circle with a physical circle for the physical the observable circle has volume  length physical properties    is this what you are trying to say here
  everything freaking everything is made ouf of elementary particles  as far as we know spacetime isnt quantized
  sometimes the math is inspired by real phenomena sometimes it isnt    lets say the mathematical definition of a circle was invented first you can take that definition and identify the points with atoms elementary particles or whatever this works as long as the points particles are small in comparison to the circle itself  take a ring of metal with a radius of 10 cm you can reasonably model it as circular without making a huge error  take a set of a few atoms with a fixed distance of a few atom diameters from a central point thats not a circle    from this we can state that you are not allowed to model a mathematical circle with a physical circle  well there are no physical circles the mathematical definition is absolute if the elements dont have 0 dimension it cant be a circle    to sum up we make an approximation error by modeling real objects with abstract mathematical objects but this error is usually small in comparison with the measurement error of course that line begins to blur when you get to smaller and smaller scales elementary particles might really behave like perfect mathematical objects
  no because its actually a generalization of topology 
  so it has points
  
    thank you for the reply helps to understand the process    in addition could you clarify this   since the mathematical circle and any physical representaion of a circle are not interchangeable for mathematical circle being formed of points     so from mathematical point of you it is not acceptable ever to define a mathematical circles circumference eg 5 cm a physial world distance because the cm is a model of the physical representation of a circle
  of course thats allowed you cant calculate stuff if you dont put in real world data your model needs that as an input so to speak
    wait the mathematical circle  of points dont possess the quality you describe as length   that would mean its a representation of a physical observable circle no
  curves and lines as sets of points have the defined property of length
  you can define length mathematically in fact we already had a notion of length when we defined our circle all points have the same distance from the center distance is the keyword here
    yes distance is the keyword here what is the unit of the distance what i understand from you at this moment it can not be centimeters for example for that is a property of a physical observable circle which is not the mathematical circle
  i think you missed a joke
  clarifying    im not granted the pleasure to model a mathematical circle by using a physical observable circle for the construct of the circle a point is not a model of an observable particle   that being said units used to define observable real world particles can not be used to define non observable  imaginary points no
    a point can be a model of an observable particle if the particle is sufficiently small say again you have the metal ring you can model the atoms of the ring as points  you measure the radius of the real object lets say its 1 meter now you create two mathematical points at different positions and arbitrarily define the distance between them as 1 meter unit whatever its just a word the circumference of that mathematical circle will correspond to the real one within the limits of the model its not really about what the units are called but how you translate them from the real world to your model and vice versa
    now we are on the same page  this is not mathematics in its purest form anymore since we are talking about models of observable particles now     i swear this is the last in need of clarification   now you have a circle that made of points that model observable particles of reality most importantly a finite amount of particles how can you get a constant like like π with these premise     remembering still that we are talking about a mathematical circle of points models of observable particles  even to a degree they are countable if we desire so
  this is not mathematics in its purest form anymore  well discrete mathematics exists you can build models that are even closer to reality on small scales    how can you get a constant like like π with these premise  you wont get exactly pi but something that approaches it connect the particles with lines and add up the lengths of the line segments the more particles you have to closer that sum will be to pi given a radius of 1  in practice with a macroscopic circle and atoms as points you will never be able to measure the difference
  you will never be able to measure the difference  and thats why we choose a mathematical circle as model
    thanks for the reply makes sense         as long as you dont use definitions of units that require elementary particles with your mathematical models that dont model circles of elementary particles its all good

  bad list why not learn classical mechanics well since the beginning start with landau and lifshitz go all the way to gravitation by thorne and wheeler and beyond
  why the townsend book  we use griffiths its decent but probably missing stuff  my professor still likes bayms book
im going to ask here quickly because /adv/ isnt much help    as a neet loser for 5 years how do i get back into learning about science math and more without a structured environment in place i am autistic and have difficulty knowing where to start or how to navigate resources without structure    issue is i also have very bad mental health that makes taking actual courses not really viable
  ad infinitum
  whats your goal for fun phd academia job
  for not suffering the rest of my life as a retard that does nothing and has accomplished nothing maybe one day i get mentally well and makes something of my life taking care of my mind would help that i take care of my body now and that helps    so yeah fun i guess
  even as an (((engineer))) my sides go into orbit every time i see this one

  where tf does one takes his comments about this list it has several flaws imo   basics   feynman leighton and sands should be an alternative or a complement to the basics to read in order to develop an intuition about the physics and thus facilitate the comprehension of the maths  statistical  thermal physics should follow a primer in thermodynamics  maybe a sr book shall help  intro  hartle is more adapted than schutz  where is atomic/nuclear physics and spectroscopy  where are analytical mechanics  where are continuous media mechanics and fluids mechanics  these topics cannot be properly covered only by taylor and townsend how about some general introduction to advanced topics  how about some laser/plasma physics   moving on    since we are in the reference book tier  where is mtw   where is aschcroft and mermin or kittel   schwabl is really hard to read especially if you have not read the quantum mechanics beforehand i dont know an equivalent but easier to read book but schwabl shouldnt be used to study  shouldnt it be useful to propose some maths/programming/physical chemistry reference to consolidate the knowledge   advanced  best way to start qft is lancaster and blundell deal with it feymann is good though  wald it is but if mtw has already been read wald can be skipped directly to hawking and ellis  landaulifschitz books or easier to read equivalent reading become mandatory in this level  advanced  ok but how about all the weinberg qft gravitation 
  its an infograph now  at least its not taking up much space anymore
  feynman leighton and sands should be an alternative or a complement to the basics    the feynman lectures on physics are a fucking meme and not a replacement for undergrad level physics
  alternatives and elective material doesnt really fit the infographic style the recommendation page is better for that   
  nothing on error analysis  so you basically just want to learn a ton of shit people have discovered in the past without gaining the ability to actually test the most simple of hypotheses in practice  no mathematical prerequisites  you dont have to include a list of math books but at least list which topics you should be familiar in order to understand a book
  simply check this thread and the prior ones
  not big infographics general  disliked unsubscribed banned from the gnu and wine communities
  /g/ay
is there a scientific computations chart
  solid state before statistical    what
  make one
  then follow fail safe and basic in  is a solid choice after that skim through as many subjects as you can see what you like and learn that subject or if you want to start right now elementary number theory is fun and you dont have to know much before an introduction to the theory of numbers by gh hardy and em wright is my favorite

there was a math infographic that started with a couple books on proofs and logic anyone have that one
  exactly thank you
  wew nice meme
  who is the idiot who spams these i have russian mathematician friends and this list is complete bs
  kek
  is this good
please dump all you have on hs math
        wtf is this shit that is recommended to read by year or is this something russians supposedly read
  no you only need i starts from a very basic math level to more advanced topics the other image is a brain rot meme
      books are all freshman level    while     books range from freshman to graduate level
ill be dropping some stuff ive accumulated on sci
  ur a god
  brain rot meme  how so i made the guide and while now i would probably choose to drop or at least make optional logic by smith i feel the rest of it accomplishes what i set out to do create a study guide with a foundational approach while having some overlap in between each book    theres already a bunch of study guides but stuff like this    is awful or at least misusing the name the whole point of my guide was to try and approach the subject in a different order thats why basic mathematics comes after foundations of analysis something that would never happen traditionally    im also aware that the books are freshman level thats the point i didnt want to make a complete 3 year study guide especially considering you can branch out a lot more after spivak you can go to baby rudin start with linear algebra dip into abstract algebra etc
  thanks bruv

  weird way to say geometry
  conway  into the trash it goes
requesting one of these for biology
  why not making one
  kek then you realize that you know everything to code numerical solutions except numerical analysis itself
  autism reporting for duty
  my sides
  i wont make you a thing but i suggest whatever the best practices books and problems are for the following subjects    statistics most emportent  intro biology probably not really necessary but if you need a quick introduction to these topics it will be good  genetics  cellular biology  molecular biology  more statistics  organic chem and biochem  study design  evolution  books related to your interest
wake up feeling good  open math book  try to do exercises  cant do the proofs  feel like a giant idiot  dont feel good anymore  go back to sleep
  i know how you feel thats why im gonna start reading books about proof
  engimeme
  what is your profession anon
  i started with something basic my desire to serve my country and their requirement for all service members to score well on their intelligence test this exam the asvab evaluates you on your understanding of english and math as well as science and mechanics to a lesser degree from a high school level
  im curious are these advanced level math books required to go through a physics major     i always assumed youd need nothing more than applied versions of say calc/differentials/linear algebra or should i take the more abstract/proof heavy mathematics
  advanced level  none of  books are advanced  apostol  spivak are mere freshman calculus books  the other books are precalculus level
  i meant for anyone majoring physics do they require rigorous math courses that a pure math major would take for instance
  except for set theory    i meant for anyone majoring physics do they require rigorous math courses that a pure math major would take for instance  what
  why apostols calculus and not stewarts for example
  except for set theory  no
where can i download these books in pdf
  genlibrusec  rutracker  google for pdfs
  naive set theory    naive  advanced
alright guys i made one please be nice
  god
  ask ur mom

    maths o y/math
lets say i graduated from a computer science program thats just as rigorous as /sci/ likes to poke fun at  lets also say ill be starting a phd program in the fall and between now and then id like to really brush up on math  i was thinking langs basic mathematics then apostols calculus vol i and ii then linear algebra axlers book says its for a second course and while i had a course in undergraduate i dont really remember anything should i do halmos then axler or just one of them
  12 rules for life is ultimate basedcore
    basedcore  fuck meant    math s o y /math
  we should make more of these specific reading list are far superior to general ones    nice work anon
  stop making fun of cs majors for being bad at math  also help me with this middle school level math i need for a phd
there sure is a lot of foundational stuff here but what do i /need/ to read im on time constraints here
not sure if i should start a thread on this but is there a chart/guide to things like ecology and environmental science     its so serious but im overwhelmed by the complexity and politics of it all
  putting the bible next to textbooks  why are you like this
  yeah they should have enlightened atheist readings like harry potter
larsonstewart    rigor a shit
  are those fail safes freshman level can i go from there if i dont know high school maths
i cant wait to get learned but im so busy right now soon
  seconding
i am having doubts whether i am really into physics i will try to list my thoughts and i hope you can tell me if this is normal  i like the idea of doing physics i think it is a noble work  i am sort of curious about nature but not as much as i was in my youth after graduating i got overwhelmed with how much there is to know and it sort of feels like no matter what you do you will never understand nature you will understand just one tiny mechanism of nature  i do not really enjoy the process of learning all that much i find it tedious 80 of the time  when i was doing my thesis i found it much more interesting and rewarding than the previous four years it was motivating on its own right i enjoyed giving the presentations to my professors and such  is this normal or should i just quit
bisnaga
  ahah le bong bing reference
sounds pretty normal to me the whole dynamic of attending classes and studying for exams is a buzzkill if anything
  yeah this is pretty normal i think exams suck literal balls after many years of them im doing my thesis work now im enjoying this so much more than classes finally i get to do cool stuff and can begin to try and push the boundaries a little of whats known but i suppose the exams were a necessary part too as a filter and also to gauge when youre ready but yeah no exams for me anymore ive really grown to dislike them
if wormholes are real how would a wormhole form or be created in the first place
two black holes get too close to each other
  there is no real mechanism for forming a wormhole except by saying suppose a wormhole is formed    scientifically wormholes do not exist
  they could be all over the place in the most literal sense see the erepr conjecture
no10179127  in the 4th spatial dimension
  if wormholes are real  they arent
    i would imagine that the mechanism for creation must take place at some point and that point separates away from itself via expansion    of course there may also be another way my good sir
  scientifically wormholes do not exist  which means absolutely nothing
  a solution to gr equations dont exist scientifically  yes lord method they have not yet been observed but its not like theyre some supernatural magic they fit our current scientific understanding of space time if we observed one we wouldnt even have to change gr not that such observations might not lead to new understandings but its possible they might not  the same cannot be said for your brain it doesnt exist
of course wormholes are real just look at any piece of dirt fucking brainlets lmao
when the day comes that its feasible to mass produce genetically edited babies made in a tube we should outlaw natural birth and/or sterilize the population in order to control both population the nurture environment of future generations and the genetic fitness  diversity
  i mean it will get to the point where natural births will have basically the same results as edited babies if both the parents were edited to the degree that they can rest easy theyre children will be fine with or without editing
  /thread
  when the day comes that its feasible to mass produce genetically edited babies made in a tube we should outlaw natural birth and/or sterilize the population in order to control both population the nurture environment of future generations and the genetic fitness  diversity  yeah man authoritarian governments controlling every aspect of the individuals life down to his very ability to have children have always worked out so well in past
  brave new world is something we should aim for  ok retard
its 2018 werent we at least promised some fully workable cybernetic arms race with people willingly cutting off their limbs and replacing it with machine parts    but all we get is really awkwardreally slow stuff that taking forever to have improvements is it an ethical issueif so why hasnt china the most unethical place in the world had any development in this  or are we missing some wonder material that aids in nerve to electronic interface    youd think the military would be on top of this so they can keep wounded soldiers on the battlefield longeryes yes i know darpa has a project but look at the budget for it its minuscule
  the interface between metal and flesh hasnt properly been cracked yet
      its closer than you think
  elon musk
  ludite
  nerves fibres are incredibly fine and have complicated routes we can connect up an impulse to a nerve grossly thats been done for years with cochlear implants visual aids for the blind and some limb work but that doesnt give anything like function wed need to be able to work out exactly where each fibre goes or make the brain reconfigure it to have full function the latter is probably the better option
      while i like elon musk what he is hoping to do with neuralink isnt possible and likely down right scammy he is talking about sending megabytes worth of data to and from a computer the bandwidth problem we dont have the technology to do that
  neuralink has just made the breakthrough
  military technology is not disclosed thats why
its unethical to experiment on people in order to make these machines better
  the world is gonna be biopunk rather than cyberpunk sorry
  damn that pic is fucking hot
  isnt possible  it has been possible for years      this is from 2015

  why is cybernetic progress so slow  its hard
  why is cybernetic progress so slow    lack of good business payoffs
  technological breakthrough  soon
  its 2018 werent we at least promised some fully workable cybernetic arms race with people willingly cutting off their limbs and replacing it with machine parts  im still waiting for hover cars and a space hotels we were supposed to have by the year 2000
  i was thinking punished clip art guy
    fuck man thats just too complicated lets just replace the brain with a computer then all this messy metal to nerve interface bullshit isnt necessary
  two problems   interface and power source   if youve got a pair of robot legs what is powering them are you wearing a heavy ass battery pack or just a really long extension cord are you only able to be on your feet for 30 minutes before the battery dies and youre stranded in your front lawn until a neighbor sees you
    yeah and how about those pills we could pop instead of having to eat a proper meal
    jesus dude you just have to think outside the square the obvious power source is a petrol generator disguised as a lawn mower you push it around in front of you people think you are some fucking crank who pushes a lawn mower everywhere but little do those fools know it is secretly powering your robotic limbs
  if the guy lost weight they could give him a prosthetic beer belly as well
how can quantum immortality be real if i could just choose to blow my brains out hows that for immortality huh
  do you think you can actually choose to do that try it
  this is what i was looking for go ahead /sci/ goad me into committing suicide
  you wont know if the gun misfires someone comes in to stop you just in time or the neurons in your brain tell you to not do it at the last second if the bullet passes through your brain in such a perfect way to allow you to survive despite not functioning fully afterwards or you just fucking miss somehow until you actually do it    btw dont even try it youre worth more alive than dead
your brains would be blown out in 1 everett branch but your consciousness would just shift to another everett branch where your brains werent blown out
  your perception of reality will inevitably respawn at some point if time is infinite and possibilities endless
  but your consciousness would just shift
  i dont want this
  no one gives a shit if you die but you are composed entirely of chemicals and we dont know what causes conscious so good luck as a mutated chicken to be beheaded
  its happened to me twice hell is remembering what you left behind heaven is forgetting and living in peaceful bliss
  puuump it
  
  you sound retarded hell and heaven are subjective were living in a continuum and youve not died simply lost some brain tissue due to a lack of processes creating gradients leading to degradation due to instability
  youre worth more alive than dead  no hes not
    what if i die from old age what happens to my consciousness
  you choose when to die unless the simulation breaks before you do
  cringe
  what the fuck so i just live forever if i want to  the suicide part made sense i was liking this theory but living forever is just stupid
  then just dont live forever retard no ones forcing you to
  how would you explain the non existance of extremely old humans in our timeline i get it your organs start failing and living becomes a hassle but we shouldve already witnessed some rich madman somewhere around world who just decided to live forever spending all his money on surgeries and medications  it just doesnt add up
  lmao    x2 lmao
  try it faggot you might just prove quantum immortality for yourself
brainlet thread brainiacs please dont bully us
dont feel bad everyone is a brainlet at something stephen hawking didnt like trump because hes a brainlet
  i have taken multiple iq tests and it seems that my iq lies somewhere between 90 and 100 dont laugh do you guys think that i can still succeed in studying computer science despite my cognitive limitations i had slightly above average grades in math and i can program
  yes but youll have to work really hard its possible just difficult
  most people who study computer science dont become scientists they get a job doing programming if that is your goal youll be fine
  hands you a helmet  just kidding iq means nothing most people cant do math or program iq results are not real life  believe
oh if you guys have any questions about math or science i can try to answer them i promise i wont be condescending
  why is their stuff
  you do realize that the iq test was designed by eugenicist right if you actually believe in the test then youre already fucked    i would quote stephen hawking but i dont care enough to find the quote
  retardation   i think he means adhd and in that case hes on some pill
  you have above the average iq for cs
i think people are just too lazy to study today because there is too much things to stray you from the books   i dont think is hard for a healthy human being learn things like math or physics and have a deep understanding of it but overcome the laziness and have discipline to study everyday are the true beasts to be slayed
  as a selfloathing idiot who didnt put in the effort in early academia because it wasnt challenging for me to wing top grades until about college before burning out this anon is absolutely correct discipline to study is more important than some inherited perception of intelligence once you get to the even remotely complicated stuff not accounting for anomalous gaps in actual ability of course
  iq test is just an external behavior doesnt really measure youre actual intellect just saying believe in yourself
    agreed 100 was excellent in school terrible in university
  this is my 4th year in uni and i still cant study everyday its just that i get distracted alot and especially of my other hobbies such as drawing i think i will never be cured from laziness
  if youre asking why matter exists at all no one knows scientists call it the baryon asymmetry and its still a major unsolved problem  
      i think there are two types of brainlets in this world    the most common ones are the those who grew up not giving a shit about basic mathematics and they themselves forever they arent into math when they flunk at college    the other ones are us who even though we tend to suck most of the time we try to become as good as brainacs get average grades with a lot of effort
  your iq is too high for cs im afraid youll have to sniff some glue to match your cs peers
  muh quotes  youre one of us friend

qtddtot    help me understand why my reasoning here is wrong you roll a fair dice 10 times in a row there are at least k ones where 1  k  9  whats the probability that the total number of ones is k  my reasoning lets say k9 to get number of ones  9 one of the rolls shouldnt be 1 thats probability 5/6  the answer uses conditional probability i understand why this works but i dont understand why is not equivalent to what im doing the answer is 50/51    thanks
  can you rephrase the question
  you could have rolled the not1 on any of your rolls not just a particular one    1111111112  1111111121 etc vs only  1111111111
  sure  you roll a fair dice 10 time in a rowyou know the number of 1s out of 123456 is at least k 1  k  9 what is the probability that the actual number of 1s is k
  so i can get the not 1 in 10 different positions  ok i get it  i have 5 numbers that are not 1 x  23456  x11111111  where x is in one of the 10 positions  so thats 510  50  51 is the number of sequences you can form with 9 or 10 ones and 1 number from 2 to 6 those are the former 50 sequences plus 1111111111    thanks

used to participate in a plethora of /sci/tier activities in high school  robotics team science olympiad valedictorian fullride scholarship after hs etc  enroll for cs degree  lose all drive and get bs for the first time in life  get home from classes and eat junk food and play video games like a filthy normie instead of fiddling around in linux like the old days  where did it all go wrong im tired anons
  where did it all go wrong  when you started acting like a nerd because you wanted social benefits      robotics team science olympiad valedictorian fullride scholarship  unrelated exclusive social clubs    you dont give a shit about anything related to /sci/ otherwise you would be doing that instead of wanting to play vidia    think about what you actually want to do for the rest of your life and stop going along with what everyone tells you to do    unironically learn how to be yourself
  try comp eng ee or just straight mathematics  cs is soul sucking garbage anon  t cs and math double major dropout with it/networking/telecommunications  software dev background
  because you are a little bitch that needs to get over themselves and actually start doing work this isnt high school anymore
where did it all go wrong  when you picked cs
  can you expand on this why was cs so bad
cs is fucking terrible thats where it all went wrong   cs hate thread
im the opposite i didnt give a shit about high school and i graduated with a shitty below average gpa now im a phd physics student

i might be showing my retardation here but if you have a plane composed of two orthogonal real axes and you extend each axis into complex space do you have one imaginary axis or two
the most important thing about cooking is to act naturally
  assuming that the imaginary axis is orthogonal to the two other axes it can only go in one direction so one
  assuming that the imaginary axis isnt orthogonal to both the other axis then its infinitly many it can turn around the axis in an infinite amount of different angles
  this is not how it is done firstly you should clarify what space you are dealing with and then you think whether you can picture it   in particular   extend into complex space  is not a mathematically valid construction   that being said you should read up on the c2 space
found this old puzzle and book can you solve the riddle
  one is female the other is male got pregnant
  the obvious answer is he sold one of them when it was a baby and the other one when it was grown and strong or some sort of my kingdom for a horse situation  but its probably some stupid pun im not thinking of
  he sold one for a cent and one for a dollar
  maybe like other anon said one was sold when baby thus few expenses while the other was sold when adult thus lots of expenses in the long run it was 100 times the gains
  maybe there are 101 pigs  for one   and the other 100
the answer is so dumb and i feel bad for making this thread now
  maybe the pigs are butchered into either 100 pieces of meat and 1 piece of meat or 100 but only one survives
  maybe he named them one dollar and one cent like other anon or he selled them at one dollar and the other at one cent
  post it
  he does a buy one get one free that way the cost of the first pig is 100 of the second
   i feel bad for making this thread now  you should
  holy shit this is retarded
  ones alive and the other is dead
  he sold one as expensive meat
another one
  tortoise is battle formation      get one for dollar and second for 1 cent as deal
  does anybody has that picture when theres chopped pork with piglet puzzle sticker    i lost it thank you in advance
  was this the egghead that got killed when an eagle dropped a tortoise on his head thinking it was a rock
  what other uses are there for pigs
  kys
  pet pigs are considerably cheaper than pork by the pound so
    yep
  w what
  based
  identical twins
  that doesnt really answer the question at all
   sneaky lateral thinking puzzles  just make up some arbitrary nonsense that isnt reflective of anything that can happen in the world
  fuck this now im driving to the shop to buy ham in the middle of the night thanks a lot
  well he was killed by an eagle the means is incidental and he can be only correctly said to have been killed with a tortoise or killed by tortoise not by a tortoise
  he couldnt catch the tortoise no matter how much steps he made
  thats transphobic
  all lateral thinking puzzles are like that i honestly would enjoy them if they werent presented as realistically solvable puzzles
  fucking kek

 op    these questions are so retarded post more op
  i thought like this but more with inflation in mind
do you have any mental abnormalities/diagnoses do they help you in science inb4 beautiful mind
  one time i woke up from a dream and could hear whispering in my head and then i remembered schizophrenia usually develops around my age so i got a little freaked out but its ok now
  hypnopompic hallucinations  it is normal  t psychiatrist
i have bipolar  im on meds so it doesnt help shit
i probably have something i was never formerly diagnosed with anything my parent had me go to a doctor once because they were worried about my mental state as a teen but i am pretty good at normie larping and got the doctor on my side he told my parent something like he just wants to go down the path less travelled  more recently i mentioned some of my symptoms to my gp last year during a rough patch they thought it might have been anxiety and suggested some cbt resources but when i looked at them they were very normie focussed and talking about situations that have never bothered me    the only thing that bothers me is other people not my own thoughts my best guess is depression as a result of untreated autism and/or narcissistic personalty disorder maybe aspd but i have a cousin with autism and brother 10 years younger than me who was put on the autism spectrum for behaviours i had at his age    do they help you in science  absolutely not i have a meticulous and inquisitive personality that helps but having my very will to live sapped out of me everytime i have to spend too much time around people is draining not to mention my habit of having a laser focus on things that are nothing but a distracting waste of time
  believe it or not i used to be in arts one time i fell down on my head very hard for some reason woke up thirsty for maths and now im doing my masters in pure mathematics
  depression anorexia and bulimia  an empty stomach helps me concentrate on my work
  people in videos i watched on youtube talked to me and had conversations with me when i was smoking weed a lot    it didnt really helped at school but it made me question my reality so thats something i guess
  overthinking and extreme orderfreak  both help tremendously for science not for other things
  depression manic episodes  no they do not
  ive had periodic episodes of psychotic depression since i was 16  i think you can probably imagine theyre not very helpful nowadays i can function relatively normally most of the time but my academic career has still been a car wreck compared to what it wouldve been if my mind always worked properly
  keep strong friend  i have recurring depression and stpd/schizophreniform disorder
  i woke up from a dream  dont worry i have to get up super early for work and im a hard sleeper id say 20 of the time i have to shake the dream from my head when i wake up  one of these experiences had jesus show up in my room hit the snooze button and then tell me he called into work for me and told them i was sick so i can sleep in   i think in a previous life i was a hibernating bear or a really lazy housecat
ocd enough that it was giving a lot of daily anxiety consistently making me late to school/work and i had calluses from door checking i take meds now that knock it most of the way down    it is actually useful for lab science at current levels im more careful than i know i otherwise would be
severe depression and schizoid personality disorder meds dosent work they make it worse and i get easily psychosis from them totally delusional i can also be manic when i have alot of stress and when i take amphetamine amphetamine helps on my depression the only cure i found
  be me about to fall asleep  fall asleep  dream about lying down on my bed in my room  see a tall skeleton like shadow figure looking into my room from the window  get shit scarred  go to the living room in the dream  stand there for a bit    in the morning mum asked me wtf i was doing the day before  none of it felt even remotely real
minor aspergers severe depression and paranoid schizophrenia
   i can also be manic when i have alot of stress and when i take amphetamine   i wonder why you get mania and not psychosis out of these
  mild social anxiety  mild depression  thats what i have its not severe enough to the point that i cant go to class or study i can tolerate not talking to people for longer periods of time compared to normies my record was almost 1 month i just studied in my room all day during the holidays
  the impact fixed your brain
  ive got ptsd and atypical anxiety disorder    i can certainly read and process a lot more information than most people but like a computer that is running overclocked i need to ensure i boot down and relax my mind afterwards    i can basically just boot into a manic state where i read and research for days on end with no distraction and no care for the outside world which is helpful
  one night i woke up and walked to the kitchen trashcan and urinated in it   didnt realize what i was doing
  it may be related to  as in both cases the senses are absorbing more stimuli than normal but hypervigilance is generally presumed to be directed towards social settings whereas when applied to academia its just the ability to be hyper aware of information and process it all at a high rate both have the same result where you need to wind down afterwards
  started hallucinating hard on weed at 17 before i picked up on it not actually happening tried to get through high school fine but ended up ostracizing myself to the entire grad year i graduated with went to university got in 1 fight among other things then got evicted from residence supposed conversations i had with people didnt exist according to other peoples reactions and i was just stroking my ego nothing eventful happened except for the sporadic visual hallucination event only reason im aware of this is because of peoples reactions and i graduated got a job got fired from said job then got into quite a lot of fights during one rave i went to now were here after my family suggested mental health my brother is bipolar but i am otherwise undiagnosed
  adhd i use the quotes because anyone who has ever met me would not describe me as hyperactive or unfocused i think robotic would be more accurate pretty sure it was a misdiagnosis of aspergers but there is no drug they can sell you for that so the doctor said adhd and made my parents insurance cut them a check americas healthcare system especially when it comes to mental health is pure evil
panic disorder finally got klonopin and i can do normal shit again this shit was ruining my life and my research
  klonopin   it begins having an effect within an hour and lasts between 6 and 12 hours4  so you suffer 1h in panic attack before the drug helps you 
  yea pretty much its like living in a nightmare
  either that or mathematicians are all fucked up in the head
  you must be skinny and cute keep barfing until youre beautiful
  when i used to take kpins i would dissolve them under my tongue so they would kick in a bit faster they taste good too at least if you dont do that already i would recommend it but really alprazolam is best for panic attacks clonazepam is useful for keeping you calm for longer periods but if you need to calm down relatively quickly then alprazolam is the way to go
  what the fuck is wrong with you
  mental abnormalities  i am abnormally smart my ability to think critically is abnormally strong
  im a schizophrenic with a chemical engineering degree who cant hold down a job no matter how low skilled anymore my mental state has progressively gotten worse every year and i just got terminated from working at subway cause i could focus enough to make the sandwiches right
  couldnt
  
gifted 130 iq  genes linked to giftedness are also recurring in schizophrenia patients  i think i used to be anxious/depressed but was never formerly diagnosed im okay now  sometimes have an irrational suspicion that people can read my mind i know its wrong but it feels real and can mess up my train of thought  id say im pretty highfunctioning but will sometimes be consumed in my own thoughts when people verbally explain things and i cant understand inexplicit instructions ex go there do this etc  i think im sociopathic i dont feel remorse or guilt i used to but i kept getting bullied and manipulated and was really insecure now i look at everything logically and can be superficially charming at will
  i did this when i was little but to a wall in front of company
  not sure about /sci/ but people on /pol/ typically have either an autism spectrum disorder and/or a cluster a personality disorder
  sounds like psychosis or something similar go to a doctor asap  i think theres drugs that help it
  theres another type of adhd that used to be called add now its called adhdpi primarily inattentive it might be that or it might be what you said
  i was diagnosed with add/adhdpi as kid but then it turned out my cognitive deficits are due to schizotypal personality disorder  yet i am taking methylphenidate im going to try to get precrtiption for pills of a bigger dose in 2 months
graphemecolor synethesia might marginally help me do math
  ocd made lab really difficult for me because i was paranoid about washing my hands and becoming completely clean of the toxic chemicals i was in contact with
so basically what are all these things in the end
  do you have delusions
  people are different normality is just a part of a spectrum on each of hundreds of different spectrums we know what helps in some of these disorders we dont know what helps in others    its difficult because its not a concrete thing you can just measure someones brain and get all the answers
  what things
  visual snow and possibly some epilepsylike syndrome of the parietal or temporal areas visual snow provides a basis for observing some lower level functions of the mind and sensory processing and it can be used to have a finer grained sense of state or as an interface visual snow is not static its dynamic and responsive to various internal and external factors     various things but particularly chocolate can bring back mild aspects of the alice in wonderland syndrome stuff i had as a child itll seem and feel like the room is very large the ceiling is high and the walls are huge or ill look down and the ground will be far away longer term and more heavy use ive had days where i felt like no matter what i did i was stationary and everything else was moving im walking and moving the world closer im going down a winding road and rotating the world back and forth parallax stuff and relative distance becomes highlighted other times moving closer to an object ill perceive it as the object growing moving away its shrinking acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and sleep deprivation slow down time sense marijuana pushes this to an extreme its as though there are more frames per unit perceptual time the measure being relative to the speed of thought and motor output cacao does the opposite ill become superhumanly strong wont feel my legs the same and i can practically blink and ive traveled a great distance    trigeminal nerve pain has shown me the most as i withered and saw myself crumbling away inside and out i learned to see positive and negative in every frame and then if you have that perception their presence and use is truly optional it taught me to turn everything and anything to use and see myself and my place in both the immediate and the greater world in a different way i started to think about what body really is and therefore identity in accordance with scale it cant be described concisely
  small things need not necessarily be small and likewise with supposedly big things gets into self directed definition down avenues we dont necessarily find cause to think about which ended up fitting neatly into other things and my idea of association memory storage and the notion of a logical framework i think my brain may have started manufacturing adrenochrome at one point i went to bed everyday knowing there was nothing other than how i would live the same torture tomorrow i slept poorly after three days straight of extreme pain up and my vision was pulsing on the peripheries i saw flashes and everything looked and felt like it was melting but in flashes i went into the bathroom and turned on the sink faucet and felt the water splash over my skin like colors and electricity it was a surprising and unknown sensation    nerve pain and long term periods of intermittent starvation surrounded by minimal food intake were destructive and i deluded myself and suppressed and twisted my psyche heavily but i was shown a lot by force takes a long time to work out of that trauma programmed animal state and realize the measures you put in place and adapted to to keep going going down these avenues makes it clear what reality really is what can be done to an animal and what the mind is capable of i spent a long time feeling like a split minded hollowed out husk of automatic responses sleepwalking through life    hopefully some of the above is useful to whoever
  im a massive narcissist but i channel it into math research and gym so that i can act smug towards literally everyone i meet  also im gay

anxiety and depression it got really bad two years ago and i had panic attacks and felt really shit in general for no reason its sort of all right now the only help i got through health care or the university systems was useless counselling try breathing my dude lol and an ssri prescription which i never took    i dont know all the things ive been diagnosed with because nowadays i dont bother seeing professionals and when i was diagnosed as a kid i was too young to remember properly i do remember that i suffered from school fobia and separation anxiety wrt my mom around the ages 711 i think there was some other stuff too but i dont remember my childhood environment was a bit messed up it was deemed unlikely that i could continue in a normal school but luckily i did also my mom died when i was 11 solved the separation anxiety also i watched her suffocate to death and my dad died a year later from cancer which presumably left some trauma or whatever     nowadays i dont quite pass for a normie but its not far off im quiet and reserved around people i dont know well enough to be comfortable around and i have a hard time making meaningful friendships or really fitting into any group this means i absolutely fail at the networking meme which will probably bite me in the ass big time when i leave the adult daycare that is postgrad    also i get very lonely which makes a bit of a vicious cycle with my anxiety/depression ensuring my life also sucks and i want to kms    id probably be doing better in every way including my studies if i didnt have these issues however since my life is devoid of any other meaning i do tend to put a lot of effort into my work so there is that
  severe depression comes and goes social anxiety always pervades motivation is typically bottomed as a student it doesnt help and i usually procrastinate the only aspect of which it does out is the fact that i have no friends or social life so 99 of my time is free and i can spend the nights before exams studying although truth be told the majority of that time is fiddling with my phone or doing other things
  thanks bro but im at a healthy weight at the moment dont know why they still diagnosed me despite the fact that ive never been underweight england is pretty weird
  i have a low iq  it only harms
  jesus christ anon thats depressing hope youre getting better
  r u a girl
  i have autism psychosis and a neurodegenerative condition    i can tell you for sure that while i had psychosis my thinking suffered i had anxiety and it made it hard to think now the brain disease also made it more difficult to think as far as autism goes it could be that it made me smart recently i found old iq testing results and some of my scores were very impressive at one point my elementary school teachers tried to get me into a gifted school because well i was very fast at mental math faster than my father who was an engineer even in middle school people always commented on this everyone noticed i could do mental math very quickly and i had a very good memory for ap history class where i got as without studying as much as other students or my sister other kids would ask hey how do you always get an a if you are such a lazy fuck who barely studies i was so good at ap history it made me feel weird when others asked how i did so well there was no secret study habit i was just smart
  do you have any proofs for neurodegenerative condition young people usually dont suffer from these
  read this post  watches clip from a beautiful mind  did you just solve riemann  im dying here    skip to 045 this scene is gold
  aspergers great for analysis of pretty much anything i put my mind into terrible for social contact
  in the era of wireless devices poor food and aluminum everywhere they do
  i have autonomic dysfunction that is being caused by a autoimmune disease we dont know which autoimmune disease yet but once we know the brain disease will likely be confirmed autoimmune diseases of the autonomic nervous system often also effect the brain
  the dysautonomia in itself is a neurological condition because it deprives the brain of blood and oxygen making it difficult to think
  your dysautonomia is possibly caused by chronic microwave exposure largely via the hypothalamus your body is put into a sympathetic dominant state when your adrenals and thyroid are finally trashed you move to the other side into chronic bradycardia and hypotension    two types of animals were identified  the strong animal  it alters its state and somewhat synchronizes with the field but tries to maintain its proper state slowly exhausting the strong animal often fails first  the labile animal  it is of a phasic character and has periods of cns excitation followed by periods of depression the highs might not be higher in amplitude than the strong animal but theres a definite difference the labile animal generally exhausts and fall well below basal values    with time this is irreversible you need to eliminate every possible cause of whats happening to you from your life immediately    signed  someone who lived it from 12 years old onwards
  also my symptoms were identical to ms lyme and all of that mris revealed nothing because even if there is an immune component its not the dominant causative agent
  yeah i have ocd ive always been good at math which maybe is the result of ocd but honestly the condition has close to ruined my life i was on various psychiatric drugs for years and even tried tms ive never felt the same since i actually started doing behavioral therapy two years ago and have gotten a lot better from ocd but i doubt ill ever recover from whatever that quackery did to me dont ever let anyone tell you psychiatry is a science
  well i am getting an mri of the spine that should eliminate any lesions in the spinal chord
  dont let them use a gadolinium contrast agent bad shit to have in you and of all my goofs its a definite regret of mine
  lmao
  no that was just a summary two and forget to mention by two other evictions after university residence ironically enough i actually have hyper awareness which i assume is why i can quell hallucinations whenever i detect them as hallucinations im not exactly inclined to throw myself in with mental illness but i do have a fucked up life
  babbies first auditory hallucinations  come back to me when youre constantly seeing figure passing through the corners of your eyes
  i have ocd and depression maybe aspergers i dunno i might even be a schizo but i really would need to look into it more    no not at all if i had the ability to obsess over the things i wanted it woudnt really be ocd
  visual snow provides a basis for observing some lower level functions of the mind and sensory processing and it can be used to have a finer grained sense of state or as an interface visual snow is not static its dynamic and responsive to various internal and external factors  elaborate on visual snow  what cool things can you do with it
  i have borderline personality disorder    borderline is great its ended all my most precious relationships allowing me to focus better on my studies    the only drawback is my forearms and neck are scarred from all the suicide attempts    its like a superpower
  not him but in one of my lecture halls theres like a venting system on the side so its a bunch of huge grilles or what to call them like plenty of stripes of pitch black into the venting system looking at those i summon visual snow to my attention and theyre also the source of plenty of visual illusions like movement where theres no movement and stuff like that i can see visual snow anywhere but its not like i think about it the pixels are so small i dont notice them unless its against pitch black or i actively want to see them    looking at it now when i settle on a place to watch for visual snow the buzzing pixels move collectively in a soft and slow manner like that of a silky wave gliding up a beach to the apex and then continuing the movement back down towards the sea again actually i might just be fooled by all the shit floating on my eyes surface getting movement when im rolling my eye in a new direction when it comes to the pixels theres no specific thing to look at because theyre buzzing in and out of existence pop pop pop and absolutely everywhere so if i see movement i cant for sure attribute it to such small things or if its really just the gunk on my eye    actually i havent answered your question at all because obviously i dont know much for sure about my visual snow since its just on the edge of what i can be sure of percieving but maybe ive given context
  i have borderline personality disorder
    actually im sure that the visual snow moves because seeing larger how much larger 300 times larger than the pixels i dont know and even then those gunk particles projected on my retina take up no more of my visible field than a dot on the wall gunk particles at the same time as the visual snow theyre moving in opposite directions mostly
  xdd same here im also a borderline it sucks i literally want to commit suicide right now
  no im not the smart kind of autistic
im not diagnosed with anything but i keep hearing weird knocking and other sounds when falling asleep or seeing silhouettes or faces also whenever i go down the stairs i feel like someone is behind me i sometimes think that people can read my mind and i keep thinking fuck off i get weird panic attacks after random thoughts like a fish falling through my sink i occasionaly think someone is talking to me but cant hear what exactly when i ask them to repeat they dont know what im talking about  i have a mild social anxiety there are some more things but this lists should be enough should i go to a doctor i dont feel like all of this is too bad but maybe i should seek help
  hppd
  where on your head specifically did you land    regards doing ba in fashion
  yes
  yeah bro see a doctor
  hppd  never heard of it before i dont think i have it i only have two of the things mentioned in symptoms visual snow and trails remaining on my eye after looking at bright enough light sources i thought everyone had that
be kid  be shy  parents divorce in messy way  always heard voices in my head thought it was normal to talk with yourself in your head  15 years   depression kicks in in last year of hs  start hearing 67 voices felt like 67 different people live inside of my head each with its own perspective of life  clearly depressed bipolar insomnia tired all the time borderly schizo just a fuck my shit up loop  never go to doctor/psychiatrist since i thought its gonna make things worse and i might end up in some facility  23 years go by finish hs start working and get perspective   end up in shitty job fixed my insomnia since i was so tired i felt asleep  end up with good perspective in life  not confused and scared of life anymore i can survive working in the shittiest place and not feel too bad  say fuck it lets go to college  go to college doing okay    its funny how fucked up you can get when parents dont raise you and guide you/talk to you about your feelings and you end up lurking internet and having no perspective whatsoever
  yes
  severe procrastination doesnt help at all obviously
  dont let them use a gadolinium contrast agent    chuck norris detected
  thanks the anxiety and stuff is less dire than it used to be although you never really know when it decides to flare up    i think my current problems could be largely fixed by having a social life which is why ive refused the ssri stuff doctors inevitably prescribe which is why i dont bother doctors with this any more its a nice thought in that it would mean this is something that could be overcome but the fact that ive been unable to make that happen makes me feel bad i feel like my life has been shit for the last few years and that it likely will be shit in perpetuity for reasons which would have been mostly preventable    i guess there is some justice in living in a hell of my own making
  depression/narcissistic personality disorder    never was formally diagnosed but i know for certain that this is whats going on some psychologists put npd on the autistic scale as well so a bit of that    it kind of helps and it doesnt because im a narcissist i feel like i have to be superior to others and if im not i gotta die trying generally it works out ok however sometimes it makes me assume that im apriori better than everybody else which ruins my grades because im certainly smart enough not to do anything for the whole semester and then just turn up to the exam to write it up sure but at the same time if i cant prove to myself that im the best id rather be dead but it pushes me to try to do insane shit that nobody even tries to do at my level hope this is not narcissism speaking in me but my genuine experience my motivation is either as high as a mountain or as low as mariana trench i rarely find myself in the middle im either the best or the worst its quite fun sometimes but i dont really like living like this    on top of that insomnia and major sleeping problems i havent slept for 2 days in a row 3 times last week going to sleep at 12 in the day and waking up at 10 in the evening on most days i feel like im going to have a mental breakdown any time soon because of this
  schizotypal personality disorder  im always in my imaginary worlds
  i have congenital hydrocephalus  a neurological condition which causes csf to pool in a patients skull treatment is in the form of a surgical implant called a shunt a silicone tube with a valve running from the brain into the torso the vast majority of people born hydrocephalic are severely mentally and physically impaired however there is evidence of the opposite effect in a small subset of patients who score higher than their unafflicted peers on verbal iq tests shunt failure can also induce precocious puberty which leads to enlarged sexual organs increased testosterone bone density and height    im one of the lucky ones missed a perfect verbal sat score by two questions im over six feet tall and have a horsecock     but i do have an achilles heel magnets my shunt has an adjustable valve  so if you have access to a strong enough emf source you could kill me fairly easily
  borderline its great it allows me to draw upon the abilities of all the other personality disorders its the best class imo besides wild mage
  i think i have that
  this happens to me a lot but its because of lack of sleep
  borderline  just a fancy way of saying irredeemable cunt
    very interesting sounds cool at first but that must be annoying when you just want to study or not be bothered
  not sure if xd
bump im so lonely bros
  absolutely not i have a meticulous and inquisitive personality that helps but having my very will to live sapped out of me everytime i have to spend too much time around people is draining not to mention my habit of having a laser focus on things that are nothing but a distracting waste of time  you could turn this around though by using this on something productive
  not sure if xd  do you mean youre not sure if my post was funny i intended it to be  most of the anons in this thread could use a laugh or are you calling it a larp    everything i wrote in this post    is the truth
i have ptsd autism add and possibly psychosis depending if the amount of weed i have smoked in the past two years did anything longterm to me    just shorten it to i am retarded and let me be on my way
  oh how could i forget dyspraxia
  sometimes i forget how fucking hot connelly is
  ccool
borderline it only occurs in individuals with very high iq having bpd is like being charles xavier in the last wolverine movie if people could feel the amplitude of my emotions they would be paralyzed with agony such is the life of a typical bpd with extreme genius comes extreme consequences ah if only i could trade it for blissful ignorance     instead i feel
  im a lazy sack of shit who cant stop daydreaming to the point i cant pay attention to a conversation or even sleep well sometimes i have delusions and hallucinations and cant stop my mind from racing i take long walks that go nowhere often i graduated with a degree in physics and math years ago but i cant hold down a job i honestly dont know what i have the daydreams are repetitive in nature and i dont understand why i have them or how to stop them
  hehe me too i am an emotional genius my eq is of the charts    i cant tell you how many times my extreme deeply heightened emotional capacity that neurotypicals are fundamentally incapable of experiencing have gotten in the way of my life    they simply cant understand what it is like    i try and tell them how would you of felt if you had a terrible toothache that comes and goes but switches between excruciating pain and intense orgasms based on your mood
my mom told me i was stupid until i was 9 and then i randomly got smart    idk what the fuck happened but i havent been the same
  i try to but it doesnt happen if i try to focus on something worthwhile therell inevitably be something with a better dopamine hit coming along  i can do pretty well with books because i find reading very fun even textbooks but just purely reading books without actually integrating the knowledge is not ideal its not terribly productive either investing yes producing no
  why not try tutoring passing on what youve learned via experience and contemplation is certainly productive and if your pupils are genuinely interested in learning i think youll enjoy teaching them  good luck bro
ocd anxiety depression    no
  dont you think you would be a normie if you had no such mental problems hence you would have no interest in science
  did you call in sick but just hallucinated it was jesus or did your boss yell at you the next day
ptsd and depression as a result of childhood abuse i was gypd out of my full potential
  sounds like me dont worry
i get really paranoid especially around exams i keep thinking that my roommates are going through my mail or watching me sleep
  severe anxiety no it makes studying very difficult i have to get last being a lazy fuck then i have to deal with being unable to focus because intense bouts of fear attack my mind every minute
  schizophrenia is a gift from god be grateful for the gift of prophets
  based the lord broke my gaming computer so it would be easier for me to focus on science
  and yet people say god doesnt perform miracles anymore
  social anxiety and also im fairly sure im mildly autistic/sociopathic and no it doesnt help because i always try and waste time to live normal life forcing myself to communicate with people trying to make friends etc  so yeah takes a lot of time and effort i kinda wish i was a full on robot then i wouldnt care about earthly pleasures like friendship and love and could fully focus on my studies
  and yet people say god doesnt perform miracles anymore    only retarded protestants say that because they tend to involve the saints and mary
  no i just overslep and felt embarrassed as fuck that my brain tricked me again  if you could make an alarm clock that required a theory of quantum gravity to turn it off id have it solved in enough time to get those last few precious minutes of sleep
  honestly same before i was medicated it was a fucking nightmare id try to leave early most days because it would take me twenty minutes to convince myself the lab door was locked or a piece of equipment was running and had enough solvents loaded in
  optimizaiton anon have you ever encountered a png you couldnt optimize further
  i was paranoid about washing my hands and becoming completely clean of the toxic chemicals i was in contact with  i just remember sitting in class wondering why i was itchy all over my body only to remember i had spilled hydrochloric acid all over myself in chem and realizing maybe that wasnt the field for me
  i have diagnosable hppd from taking too much acid clinical depression thats been diagnosed by 6 different psychologists and pretty bad anxiety     the depression definitely messes with my motivation and the hppd gives me pretty bad brain fog
  ask for epileptic drugs from your psychiatrist  i contacted a person with hppd before and he said the medication that saved him was some epilepsy medication i forget the name but im fully convinced it would help you considering you both have visual disturbances and are depressed
  in catholicism people say pope performed miracles john paul the second
  you must have very bad memory
is it normal for someone with a amnesia and aphasia to go to college and do better than other students and get an a in college biology basically i cant remember my past but i still go to college and did well in chemistry and biology it is very depressing i have lost all skills i have less social skills than autistic people i cannot drive i never remember names i cant remember anything yet somehow i can still speak my only skill left is college math biology and chemistry equations i am extremely shocked that despite all my brain damage academics have remained a strength
  gen chembio are extremely easy courses to the point where literally any highschool graduate could pass them orgo is a weed out course for people 120 iq on average obviously there are exceptions and then upper division bio courses like mol bio biochem and genetics labs are pretty intensive and would likely be difficult for someone with any intellectual handicaps
  i am just surprised to be able to do any academics at all considering how i am amnesic and have developed speech difficulty when speaking with people in the past few weeks i have avoided talking with people because conversation is challenging i hope that i will still be lucid by next spring when i apply for molecular bio and genetics but to be honest considering all my breathing difficulty i may die before next spring
  im majoring in cmol as well good luck to you if you dont mind my prying what kind of amnesia do you have and are you asthmatic in a feeble attempt to reassure you youre probably just quite intelligent and a good student most biology majors are brainlets who dont belong in the field and do not take their studies very seriously since they just want to go to med school or get jobs in pharmaceuticals or to please their parents with an easy stem degree
  i cannot remember anything from high school most of it is probably just false information and if you were to ask me about last week i might decline to speak with you because i find speech very challenging and recalling that information is usually impossiblemy breathing issues come from autonomic dysfunction so basically my nervous system is giving out and it may no longer be able to control my heart and lungs correctly    what i usually do before exams is just study ever day before the test if i take a 1 week break i will forget everything and need to start over
  congenital illness a burden i wouldnt wish on my enemies doing better than most though it seems how long have you had the aphasia and amnesia i would assume with your heart and lung problems its not related to a head injury from sports no and honestly man i have really terrible memory i have only flashes of my childhood left in my early twenties and routinely lose whole weeks worth of experiences after like 20 days elapsed
  it has been progressing slowly i say about a month ago i have started to avoid conversations people ask me hard questions sometimes like to remember things and it has become very challenging the amnesia has also began around a month ago i have given up on trying to remember my past it is to challenging to attempt any more as far as the breathing issues we think it is an autoimmune illness because of blood markers and process of elimination so i am doing an mri of the spine to check for lesions we most likely will find nothing though it may be a brain lesion but the doctors are reluctant to order iti am also doing psychological testing soon too my verbal and spatial iq last time was 137 last november it has likely dropped by now though and memory has already been below 77 so i have a memory impairment amci amnesic mild cognitive impairment
gad which make me an obssesive perfectionist and intrusive/obssesive thoughts are my everydays bread and by thoughts doesnt mean bad thoughts it can be anything i sometimes cant sleep knowing how many things are not discovered yet and how complex fields like maths or physics are to be honest i dont like being diagnose with a mental illness/disorder i prefer to think that i just have a brain that is a little different than others and has its own struggles like everyone else i needed a diagnosis since i was struggling with this a long time ago 8 yo and now im taking meds which at least help me having a good sleep and be more chill
  allowing yourself to be diagnosed with anything   why
  i have mild intellectual disability
  where do you live this is a serious question if small town just the state city id be curious to know
  why though
  i want to identify certain correlations in the present and future
  try third shift gas station clerk
  shit i have this a lot where i see someone watching me from my peripherals and then when i look over its just a plant or whatever should i get my eyes checked out
i suck at sleeping
i have adhdi along with some sensory issues no autism though as i dont fit the social criteria    btw adhd is not really an attention deficit disorder you just have trouble directing it to the stuff you should be doing id rather have my creativity than medicate it away to be honest    also i think high iq should be classed as neurodivergence at least once you get past 145 sd 15 it can cause symptoms observed in other conditions eg autism but only on the surface
  autism is brain damage stop conflating savantism with high iq
  good for you hankel 
  stop using computer
bipolar disorder    im a freshman i dont know yet but calc 1 seems easy now
  yes
depression and add    i am doing terribly and i see no reason to not blow my fucking brains out soon everything in life is based on performance and being better so someone can use you like a fucking tool that completes work on time if you dont you fall in standing in life and are completely worthless and unemployable    below minimum gpa  automatic discarded from opportunities lmao  grades arent everything anon  go to apply for research  first thing they ask is gpa so they can discriminate against you
  maybe you are just stupid
  same here except it wasnt night time whats wrong with us brehs
  bipolar i and nope it is not helpful in anyway it ruins all my relationships with professors except one and my all of my progress i can destroy and good semester in 12 weeks and my manic episodes are so fucking embarrassing the drug binges and risk taking are okay though pretty fun desu i am convinced that im going to kill myself before i generally get to graduate just because its so unpredictable sometimes i could be doing so well then i cant get out of bed for months or im energized and depressed and that where the suicidal attempts come in already fucked up my kidneys apparently but i think the doctor was just trying to scare me depression is terrifying once youve had a taste of a productive and fulfilling life
    when i was younger i had severe ocd and it literally destroyed my life i pushed through it self imposed exposure therapy/cbt and got it down to about 80 gone it shows up in my personality though as i have no tolerance for uncertainty i do math and its a double edged sword on the one hand im very rigorous and meticulous and need everything to be explicit/convincing/justified before i accept the proof on the other hand i often have this nagging feeling of uncertainty even after i know ive proven something like is this really 100 absolutely bulletproof and i have to affirm that it is more than a normal person i think being so uncertain is also often crippling since it makes things seem overwhelming or unapproachable then theres the depression which is the dominant force wrecking my life these days but thats another story
  that nagging uncertainty is called intelligence and sanity its fortunate you have it uncertainty realism and proper error control is what separates man from glorified automatons masquerading as humans despite the flesh and blood that they are
  have you tried actually being a real person and socializing to get places did elon create paypal with other people or did he do it based on his gpa
  i have mild hypochondria sometimes strikes hard but mostly i keep it under control
  what in my comment are you replying to are you hallucinating    also  autism is brain damage     laughable misinformation
anxiety half and half asocial and antisocial behavior   makes me very good at manipulation and stand up comedy makes me in general get tired of being around people cause i am constantly performing for them
  r u med student
probably undiagnosed depression since a kid
   laughable misinformation  no
  gee really makes me think
   neuroanatomical studies and the associations with teratogens strongly suggest that autisms mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception69 this anomaly appears to start a cascade of pathological events in the brain that are significantly influenced by environmental factors79 just after birth the brains of children with autism tend to grow faster than usual followed by normal or relatively slower growth in childhood it is not known whether early overgrowth occurs in all children with autism it seems to be most prominent in brain areas underlying the development of higher cognitive specialization49
  tits or gtfo
  in brief autism is associated with  altered dendritic spine formation and axonal guidance particularly in the mid second trimester  changes shortly after birth which prime microglia for chronic long term neuroinflammation  gut problems which will also cause brain damage over time    the core of autism appears to be the first on the list with the rest either adding on or following from that mechanism refer to the genetic polymorphism causing timothy syndrome for more    most of the altered neurodevelopment of autism has to do with peripheral bodily dysfunction its a response to neurological insult and its degenerative over time
      brain damage
schizoid pd apparently not much ayone can do to help me but usually im fine anyways  doesnt really help with studies i usually pass everything but with abysmal grades not sure if i can even do a physics masters with a gpa of 15 which isnt as bad in germania as it is in the us far as i know
  chaotic thought processes can sometimes be helpful and sometimes be harming the fact that they happen at all means they are helpful for a reasonable individual
  neuroinflammation causes cell death stripping of dendritic spines reduced arborization low grade demyelination altered ca2 homeostasis as in timothy syndrome also causes elevated levels of free radicals bad synaptogenesis and cell death    its brain damage one of my earliest biases was the idea of damaging something to make it work better thats what i thought as a kid there are many cases where you can achieve better functional characteristics in some respects by damaging a machine but its rarely so simple even in a case where that does happen    we need to stop normalizing autism as woo rainman who actually had agenesis of the corpus callosum and start taking it much more seriously parents that already have autistic kids do the broader culture does not
  selfdiagnosed a movie character  woooo man ill tell you what
  i didnt diagnose anything hes based on kim peek and brain imaging has been done on him    dont be a dickhead
i have narcolepsy w/ cataplexy and it blows dicks junior in chemeng w/ high gpa but im not sure if i can be in the field w/ cataplexy so im thinking of taking the lsat next year to study patent law can someone call me a retard or is it a solid plan
  what is the need i really dont care if your children get autism because you jacked off too much and the only lady you could find was 45 not that there is anything wrong with that i see no need no why no purpose
  i want to impregnate this woman
  i got diagnosed as a sperg when i went to rehab but i dont know if it holds much weight they tend to just slap some kind of label on anyone who goes there
  why do they do it
no im completely normal and nobody would even spot me as severely animefag anon
  that sounds like me but i also see things like bugs crawling up the wall very fast
  autism is caused by vaccines bodily load of toxic compounds and wireless devices its not hard to graph and the mechanistic links are there with all of them glyphosate as well
  lmao
  i dont know but absolutely every single kid there was diagnosed with something be it depression ocd anxiety or something else they would also look for absolutely any reason to medicate you if you couldnt sleep natural considering most people were brought there against their will they would load you up with trazodone not a fun place
assburgers or maybe some personality disorder like schizotypal also deprrssion from being a social retard
  same on the assburgs my frend
  no what youre seeing is real
bipolar disorder  yes and no quite obvious how  ednos  the net total help is on the negative side id say sure walking is good for both mind and body but worrying about food can occupy my mind completely  audiovisual hallucinations  pretty irrelevant a slight distraction  homosexuality  this one helps as i hate myself because of this so i try to justify my existence by being good at what i do
  optimized
  optimized  same file size  absolutely shameful
i go through phases of extreme productivity and phases of complete lazyness and depression no its not helpful it is fucking annoying
  same here i get visual snow and the trail remaining thing i just thought it was normal
  ahdh  no it fucking doesnt and i hate it
  it is normal hppd seems to be a massive increase in visual snow as well as crippling depression
  ass burgers and shitsophrenia     it helps by keeping me inside my apt studying 24/7 but cant make meaningful connections to use as leverage when i need something there fore i must do everything myself its a double edged sword
i havent been diagnosed with anything cause never got checked but seeing and hearing how others see and process information i can tell my brain works in a different way
  its funny how fucked up you can get when parents dont raise you and guide you/talk to you about your feelings and you end up lurking internet and having no perspective whatsoever    fucker
the only complement i ever received from my father was being called an idiot savant
  i have autism but very high functioning my moms psychology prof was astonished when i was around 5yo and speaking and communicating when diagnosed at 2yo    was never interested in learning nor school for all of jr high qnd high school i hated math and thought it was boring    i am now deciding 5years after highschool that i really fucking love math and am getting enrolled next fall for the program    i taught myself calculus simple diff eq matrix algebra logic and set theory in the span of two years and what i noticed is overall most people that are autistic do generally have good logical thinking and reasoning skills which is an advantage also we can compute things better and faster with more practice in a shorter period of time     however i can communicate decently its just more of how i prefer not to put my self in communities or major social groups i have 2 friends and thats it i also have a gf suprisingly as i thought that this would never happen to me in a million life times
  legit aspie  not helpful honestly other than that i go very deeply into topics im interested in and can pay attention to one thing for long periods but you can train for those qualities   also low but not zero empathy not particularly helpful in science but it is for navigating the corporate world
i feel like im about to fall / i gasp for air when just about to fall asleep anyone else get this not exactly worried about it but its deffo annoying
  im sure thats a normal thing can you breath fine
  yeah luckily its just a sort of gasp right before falling asleep happens a few times before im finally asleep  gah sleeping feels so good but trying to go to sleep is the worst i feel like im particularly susceptible to losing the plot at that stage of the day
  if your struggling breathing or you feel like your throat is closed then i would worry what your experienceing is normal
  thanks dood
  i was once diagnosed with anorexia in high school just because i wanted to loose some weight fukcing idiots wasting taxpayer money on a kid who wanted to loose weight when we have a fucking obesity epidemic
  what do you take   i recently had a huge spike of anxiety that caused me to restart taking ssris i hadnt taken any since 2015
  how did this happen
  i had a bad case of food poisoning once and had to go to the doctor whilst there i mentioned i was on a diet and because i wasnt massivly obese they decided to report it to the child mental health services as anorexia
add    beneficial for multitasking unhelpful for remaining focused
  how is multitasking beneficial  did you first had add or started to multitask    maybe you just trained your brain to switch tasks and it makes it satisfied    its mistake in decision not brains failure
  psychosis is acute symptom      there is shitload of non rx stuff that can help with this      treatment of it is like punishment from satan when you consider side effects of some treatments like eg possible lactation or you can choose to have really bad muscle spasm instead really fun gift      doesnt have to help i would rather recommend less usage of stimulants and do some ritual and mild sedatives before sleep optionally going uberman or different polyphasic
  people dont need to go to rehab for no reason they dont get addicted to shit for no reason 9/10 its a mental health issue
diagnosed with secondary depression and adhd but the attention deficit is more akin to sluggish cognitive tempo sct which i have vyvanse for  i also have thoughts that others can read my mind my mother in particular and i feel as if i have some sort of clairvoyance which is due to me being able to accurately guess events for example i guessed what cards my friend had in her hand 7 times in a row when we were playing the higher or lower card game and the same has gone for rolls of dice many times   the clairvoyance isnt always there but its happened too many times to me to dismiss it as coincidence
  regarding science im a mathematics undergrad and i dont feel that its helped me in my studies the vyvanse has though
  sometimes you get to psychiatric hospital just because you dont agree with certain things and you want too much of explanations that cannot be satisfied you do not obey the order of authority because of that then you are crazy
  wtf i dont believe in ghosts now
anxiety disorder  almost caused me to drop out of college but now ive got it under control  my pathological selfdoubt helps me check my methodology for flaws
    bipolar 1 here no it doesnt help but manic episodes are more euphoric and psychedelic than any drug ive ever tried 10/10 would recommend
  never but ive never met with a counselor or anything so maybe its possible but i doubt it     have an appointment with a substance abuse specialist/counselor for free through uni tomorrow bc why not i continue to do retarded shit that fucks my life up and felt pretty bad as a kid lol idk   familys always kinda ragged on mental health shit always   very supportive though kinda agree fuck that shit  cut a lot when 1112 idek why   could be cause i was a shitty bully little kid and had a good reason to hate self and want to change  find drugs and lose extremely hateful personality   smoke weed erryday 12now  pharms lol around 13 continuing with intensity  unlimited free 80mg oxycontin around 14 physical opiate addiction ensues   not until 16 or so tho cause i kept a handle on shit at first  still diverse drug cocktails of psychedelics and pharmaceuticals that whole time  always using these to dodge addiction tho lol  do heroin and meth everyday for like a year 1718  get clean from hard drugs while still got in college and maintain 35 in chemical engineering surprisingly  still constantly relapse and opiates or even kratom lol and withdrawal like constantly once again  go to healthplace at school and get free psychiatric service 6 meetings free can be a psychiatrist too  why the fuck not  setup meeting with substance abuse specialist  meetings tomorrow    pretty amazing for depression though i still do drugs lol  probably nobody rly cares but i wonder what they will say     what do /sci/ any good psychiatric drugs that actually help need to stop abusing amphetamine and found this herbal ssri called kanna thats been pretty amazing for depression though i still do drugs lel
  bipolar 1 sure as shit hasnt helped my mania struck during school years too ashamed to return after my last drop out not sure why i havent gotten around to the helium yet       can vouch for the magic feeling of being bat shit insane
  xd dude nice post
  i already regret my formulation and the post itself i cant delete it now luckily for me this place is anonymous so i can just walk away from my retarded blog post     also i dont like you
  extremely pretentious and rude for no reason you should harm yourself or end your life painfully    dont worry anon hes off to kill himself now so you dont have to
  i got adhd but wont go to the doctor to get it diagnosed
  try modafinil
  so you have no adhd if you have no diagnosis
  i did exact same at my buddies house but that was alcohol
  ive been at 1 for some time now luckily im able to have a split mind 
  adhd access to amphetamines makes studying much easier the disorder itself is annoying sometimes but it also makes killing time very easy since you can just sit there and think about retarded shit and hours disappear
  mentally ill people are dumber especially schizophrenics and autists americans are so silly
  your iq is not related to the disease it can impar your cognitive ability but your overall iq is a separately determined metric
  pulling things out of our ass i see
  bump
  its pretty obviously related to the disease m8 hence disease
  internet raised me for a good part of my life i turned out to be a massive fucking loser
  schizo  autism is a disorder of high intelligence and schizophrenia though associated with low intelligence is associated with high imagination  
  i suffer from brainletism
  schizo isnt associated with low intelligence    untreated schizo can fry your brain and make you less intelligent that much is true but according to research more intelligent people are more likely to develop schizophrenia    schizo is associated with higher intelligence and higher creativity and imagination    this correlation between high intelligence and schizo can be explained in various ways though for example more intelligent people are more likely to use drugs and people who take drugs are more likely to trigger schizophrenia or more intelligent people have more loosened and vast associations are wired in a way in their brain that makes them more vulnerable to psychosis there are other explanations too
  add problematic motor development that led to me focusing on my intellect  oh im probably on the spectrum too
  i always imagined manic episodes as a bit like lsd/1plsd what would you say
  i wish i could avoid talking to people that long  my parents are permaafraid and would go nuts if i dont call at least once a day
  speaking of nerve pain i can totally relate to that  always liked extremely spicy food till the point that i did quite a bit of damage to my stomach hpylori  i just simply can ignore pain at will    not long ago i stretched a tendon extremely nearly severed it actually  managed to mostly sleep it off to the day after and still go to the er and attempt to walk there i stopped at some point though nit because of any pain but because my foot couldnt support my weight  at all  also managed to get a few blunt trauma injuries where i insisted on not taking any pain meds docs and nurses couldnt believe me at some point    i just somehow manage to do something similar to what you described controlling my perception of pain
  you didnt even read the paper
    would add i had a mildly botched circumcision at 7 yo stitches failed twice    could that explain my inorgazmia even though my parasympathetic nervous system behaves nominally in any medial inspection    plz halp /sci/
  i love fucking with individuals i care for the most
science was my thing since i was four or five and discovered the unseen world within the lake in my backyard kids knew me as the science guy who ordered and raised cecropia and luna moths    who was commissioned to give biology talks to different classes and even to the entire elementary school once that was also around the time that i was diagnosed with adhd and years later major depression adhd and the intermittant mdd that sprouts up under certain circumstances every 5 or so years exist solely to place me on the precipice of ruin making me have to claw my way back up so i dont fail my lifes purpose       yo i was working on doctorate in clinical psychology and beh neuroscience before the most recent mdd episode a few years back fought back and am now about to finish the stem cell bio graduate program at my university   your descriptions are strong indicators that you may be entering the prodrome of schizophrenia a 12 year long phase prior to the onset of sz proper how old are you that would be helpful to know
  im just dyslexic but i feel that it actually helps me idiot proof what im saying
  he is right regardless schizophrenia is more common at genius iq levels and seems to be preserved because it goeswith those alleles
  i just finished watching a beautiful mind and one particular part got me when the 70s kids mock the way nash walked to his face this didnt really happened right in princeton of all places to nash of all people

  atypical depression cptsd bulimic  it doesnt help its actually pretty inconvenient
mild aspergers    i usually get better grades than the average but few times upper than 1 standard deviation  i excel in languages tho i speak spanish english and chinese  but socializing  sucks at socializing  looks kinda creepy or kinda randomly funny  smart enough to look really smart above the average person not smart enough to excel in studies  no gf  always wishing not being born with assburgers  see other aspies theyre retarded and worst of all they behave as me  no emotion in life  easily manipulable
  youre talking about troxel hall at iowa state university
  high functioning autism but apparently its actually aspergers    it doesnt im not a scientist im just socially pathethic they always said ill be really good at doing one thing and i still havent fucking found it  the only reason i keep my grades is to further decieve myself that i can call myself something positive
  troxel hall  haha those are huge but actually its in kth in stockholm and like theyre part of the ventilation system so they lead into a wall sort of its pitch black behind them you know theyre like small openings into a box so not much light coming from inside there at all so if that type of contrast wasnt there i dont think id be seeing the same stuff
  cptsd  why
  bump lol 
  im addicted to 4chan and no they dont help me in science they just make me feel like im pretty awesome when im not c
  yes did you get it for phimosis
        diagnosed with bipolar 1  get back to my computer after ranting about psychotic breaks during school years in my car  see this post that was published 2 minutes ago  get angry that my paranoia thoughts are true and that people watch and listen to me  reply  check back days later see im told to kill myself

what is wrong with evidencebased medicine arent the biomedical scientists the real doctors why dont we advocate towards sciencebased medicine
  garbage in garbage out there are increasingly more observational studies in which causative links are suggested when the link can only be concluded as associative these studies are retrospective research on prospectively collected data which is often flawed in certain aspect and cannot be used for anything other than what is it originally intended for
  no evidence of effect is not the same as evidence of no effect many confuse the state of having no studies showing effect as the same as having studies showing no effect
medicine is science based you pleb and biomeds are literal brainlets since i was one before med school
  but no evidence of effect is the same as no evidence of results which is what medicine cares about
  whats wrong is that there is too much biased research and brainlets like me cant tell shit research from actual legit research at times
this shit really grinds my gears the symbol should never ever fucking be used compute the parenthesis and get 3 6 23 according to the internet is 9 but integer multiplication commutes so i should be write 632 and get 9 but by the flawed left to right logic you actually get 4 the only way this shit should be written say in a calculator is 6/212))) and that equals motherfucking 1
its 1
op here i cant be wrong fuck symbol its logically fucked left to right is bullshit
  thank you holy fuck
  i just realized the emoji i used to represent the division symbol doesnt translate over fml
        in the real world the answer is 9 sorry to burst your bubble but the absence of an operator after an angled bracket is representative of multiplication    im just a 30 something y/o hydrologist though what would i know
its 9 using the division simple in that manner     most textbooks quit using that division simple around the time of order of operations is introduced do to confusion    very great article i read on this yesterday    
  division simple  division symbol    my bad hahaha    i swear im not retarded btw 
  i read this article too and its dead wrong the left to right argument is logically flawed even if thats how dumbass 3rd grade math is taught and the commutativity of integers proves it pic related
doesnt even matter if you put 23 into bad form 2x3
its 1 and anyone who disagrees is a brainlet
  the symbol should never ever fucking be used  fuck off back to   it doesnt have magical powers  6/212  6/23  33  9
  6/239    lol its 1 sorry
            kill yourselves
  eat shit brainlet
  i feel repulsed by your handwriting
  if you agree that this should really be written as a fraction how do you know it is   6/211 with just 6 in the numerator  and not  6/212 with 6/2 times the quantity 12  knowing this blows the whole thing wide open and is a reason why horizontal format is shit
  good
  you must almost be as bad at math as meteorologists are read 
  6/23  6/32
once you pass elementary everyone ceases using this notation and it stops being an issue
  fuck off it is not a problem  the expression is ambiguous and not worth anybodies time whoever wrote it should be shot
  i tried telling myself that couldnt hold myself together
  but 
  i think the proper way to do this problem would be something like  6 / 2 1  2  6 / 2 3  18 / 2  9  this is because 6 / 2 is a fraction and the numerator is what changes when its multiplied by an integer or a decimal number
  6/23 should be the same as    6    23    1
  nope    6   1  2  2    6   3  2    18    2    9
  im sorry you cant make logical conclusions
its fucking 9   it should be 6 / 212))) to be 1
  it should be 6212 to be 9  the expression in op is ambiguous there is no solution  deal with it
  34 years old
  not a rigorous proof the answer is 9  t mathematician
  he must be a wholesome 60 yro captain that smokes a pipe
  original problem is ambiguous its proof by contradiction and this proof is rigorous enough to fuck this problem into the shadow real tf are you talking about its 1 no such thing as strict left to right unless its 6/212 illogical 5th grade format cant break integer multiplication commutativity therefor it was flawed to begin with and never should have been introduced into the education system
  obcious
  fucking based
  it is never used except for clickbait which you fell for and propagated you absolute fool

what is more fulfilling to a person who is knowledge oriented the workforce 95 or academia hell hours
  workforce rd/research position
  being a neet with rich parents
  working at walmart with your phd in computer science and shitposting on /sci/ during your free time
  greedy computer sociopath has to work at walmart with phd  and nothing of value was lost
  youre not gonna get that positon without a phd
  fuck after i got done with my classes during the first 3 years i never even set an alarm phd students are totally allowed to stroll into work at 11am provided you get your work done
  how long are your days normally
  varies depending on what i need to do i basically peace out if i have nothing left to do other times im there pulling an allnighter
  but i have a phd      yeah i miss the grad school lifestyle shit was so comfy        im doing govt rd and its pretty nice overall has its pros and cons though im not sure academia is such hell hours though seems like you can just coast after you get tenure

why do i exist
  your dad forgot to pull out
  who says you do
  i think therefor i am
  to glorify god even if youre not religious you exist because the universe wants you to exist
  i think already assumes that there is an i so obviously if you know that i exists and that i is thinking then you know that i exists
  because youre not doing the oppose or perhaps you are
why do existence exist
  ok now this is epic
god said be and you were
  fpbp
how come you are there and i am here    how come he died but i am here but i too will die and you are there
  the most logical conclusion
  the experience of being an thinking i is innate to having thoughts of any kind there is no assumption assumption itself presupposes the i in a logical sense
  jordan peterson most intelligent philosopher in history proved it was because you have to impartialize the humanity of existence onto members of your society and proliferate intelligence for gods wisdom

in what way    because you are able to store information in the form of genes that allow your cells to specialize communicate and adapt to their environments to keep your genetic material as unaltered as possible while supplying the ingredients the cell needs to function and altering the chemical reactions that occur within the cell through complex regulatory pathways    or because you are able to process information through sensory information through receptors that are related through the spine to higher levels of the brain which is formed by a network of neurons that compute each signal related to it by calculating the algebraic sum of action potentials reaching it and launching their own if they pass a certain threshold allowing you to interpret your surroundings through what we call reason and choose the best course of action while also micromanaging your organs    or maybe its just chemistry in which case its just physics
why do we use rats and mice as research animals for human diseases and conditions when we could easily use a chimp or something i i dont get it
harder to breed and they take forever to reach adulthood plus blm would be all over scientists asses
budget cuts perhaps
  when we could easily use a chimp or something  false
chimps are big and reproduce slow  mice are small and reproduce fast
        very well then if we are to use a minimodel of a human being why mice over rats
  easier to use a chimp  uh      mouse gestation takes 20 days to complete rats are largely similar but larger and with different behavior
  they are actually used interchangeably it really depends on what theyre studying
  why dont we use africans theyre humanitys closest relative and there is an incredible surplus of them and they breed quickly
  underrated
  why we use chimps when we can use life sentence prisoners
  lol im all for this idea
  humanitys closest relative  i audibly kekked
but anon  physics is just so dry
  woah that man is hot
  and hes manspreading what a fucking pervert
  so is your vagina
  its a good analogy for the differences between men and women men care only about themselves women care about what goes on in the minds of others too

lets say oumuamua was part of a larger rocky body and natural not et    could it have been formed by a rocky super planet being sheered by a black hole event horizon what if only a small portion of the rocky body was inside the horizon while the rest stayed out and with an adequate trajectory to not be taken entirely    wouldnt the bits just barely outside of the horizon be twisted with enough force to form a rod structure  im thinking like how a fast moving object in water will create two eddie whirlpools on either side of it angled away from the forward motion    couldnt this be the solid result of that type of whirlpooling force extruding matter down the whirlpools like an astronomical spaghetti strainer
  oumuamua was just your giant turd you shitted out last week
afaik they dont even know thats the shape of it just speculation based on this blinking signal
  sorry you misclicked trying to get to /b/ today    its right over there at the top of the page if youre lost or something
  well we dont have any optical imagery    why would they model a rod shape if they werent certain it was a rod
  did you read the paper they speculate on the basis of high variability in reflectivity that the shape is far from spherical even a solar sail is mentioned as a possibility these artists impressions are just another layer of marketing
  welcome to 4channel
  could it have been formed by a rocky super planet being sheered by a black hole event horizon what if only a small portion of the rocky body was inside the horizon while the rest stayed out and with an adequate trajectory to not be taken entirely  sounds pretty ridiculous to me nothing special happens at the horizon if you fell into a black hole you wouldnt feel anything when you crossed the horizon in other words there is no really strong force there that would break anything much less shear off a slice of a planet     of course black holes do do lots of crazy stuff like spewing highly energetic jets and disrupting other objects with strong tidal forces so potentially tidal forces or jets could break up planets or asteroids or whatnot but that has nothing to do with the thing its breaking up touching the horizon
  you wouldnt feel anything when you crossed the horizon  black hole firewall
  its actually not this is redd 4channel now
  that is a shitload of speculation based on very little evidence op   but if this rock was close enough to be tidally disrupted and even spaghettified even a little and it didnt get sucked in then its escape velocity would have to be so great that when it passed us by it would just blow through like it was the roadrunner
how does one express directions or vectors in space    any direction i can think of has to be relative to something we determine on earth or a planet  how would you say a comet is going 300mph toward a direction
  you would likely have vectors on an object relative to multiple points    say youre on a ship you can arbitrarily choose the ship as your origin and calculate relative to that now say the trajectory is headed towards earth you can also calculate vectors relative to earth to warn them
  but the earth is constantly moving
  youd calculate the earths positions at any time and see if it intersects with the trajectory
take the old kilogram standard things useless now anyways write here be the center of the universe on it and launch it into space problem solved
on a related note how do 3 dimension vectors get expressed its not really something ive ever had to deal with as we always worked in 2 dimensional planes    do you just say a plane is traveling east at a 15 degree angle up in which case is it just a tuple of angles saying   270 degrees on the horizontal plane and 275 degrees on the vertical plane  that would work in space wouldnt it and the object just works as the reference point for the thrid position

how would you find all three values of x that satisfy this equation without using a graph    x2  2x
  its a trick question
  how so
  guess 2 and 4 find the third with newtons method
its around 3/4 but im too dumb to figure out what it is
  2lgx)))  2x/2  thus  lgx  x/2    sum of xn/n  x/2 or something like that    1  sum from 2 to infinity of xn/n  x/2  2  sum from 3 to infinity of xn/(((n/2  x    idk lol
  first let us rewrite the right hand side  eqnx2exlog2/eqn  next take the square root of both sides  eqnpm xexfraclog22/eqn  multiply both sides of the equation by mathmpfraclog22exfraclog22/math giving us  eqnxfraclog22exfraclog22exfraclog22logleftexfraclog22rightmpfraclog22/eqn  i rewrote the lefthand side in order to make clear the form of an identity involving the lambert w function which is then applied on both sides to get  eqnwleftexfraclog22logleftexfraclog22rightrightlogleftexfraclog22rightxfraclog22wleftmpfraclog22right/eqn  and finally multiplying a constant over to the other side our general solution is  eqnxfrac2log2wleftmpfraclog22right/eqn  the lambert w function has multiple branches evaluate for each combination of the sign of the argument and the branch of the w function to obtain every complex solution the three real solutions are  eqnx_1frac2log2w_0fraclog22approx 07666  x_2frac2log2w_0fraclog222  x_3frac2log2w_1fraclog224/eqn
draw a graph of each and read their intersections
  also mathx22x/math has three real solution but infinitely many complex solutions for example mathzapprox9090732150795i/math satisfies the equation
yall sum nerds this shit aint gonna make u rich
  to what level would someone have to study mathematics in order to be taught this biofag in training here
  selecting branches of a multivalued function is one of the core concepts of complex analysis as for the lambert w function it might show up in complex analysis but its a relatively easy concept its simply the inverse function of mathfzzez/math
  i didnt study for finals  youre lucky  did the math for you
sup /sci/    i got a question concerning relative standard deviations    if i got one data set where concentrations are given as a  of a target value lets say  101358384  101714230  100705916  101045629  101539557  101593287  101318915  100928219  99927642  99279614  99936243  99799072  99780436  100124096  99662640  100052854    and another where concentrations are given in mg/ml lets say  13928  13829  14087  13833  14129  13916  13928  14062  13763  13869  13721  1399    can i compare both data sets with a coefficient of variation
  percentages have to be less than or equal to 100 dumb yuropoor
  yes but convert first
  you dont need to convert for coefficient of variation its a dimensionless unit
sats tomorrow any advice besides sleep      18 btw for any of you faggots that still do this shit
advice for the day before the test    idk believe in yourself believe you are a god
  huh didnt know you had to be 18 to post on /r/4channel
  sleep  eat a hearty breakfast  bring a ti84 or equivalent with fresh batteries  its all basic shit if you didnt do practice tests dont bother now go in fresh and you cant really study for the sat anyway thats kind of the point  dont skip any optional stuff unless youre running out of time
  go to sleep and drink water faggot but not so much you need to piss during the test
  i dont sleep
  if you fuck up consider the act some people do better on the sat others the act
  muh sleep  muh breakfast  muh sunlight  muh unisex room
  hardest questions are at the end so when at the end if you are not sure which of two answers to guess then choose the one you think might be wrong
  go to a trade school become a welder or carpenter go to college later once you have some life experience
  yeah same ill wave if you wave
  spend the night running a marathon your intellect will improve 13 for the day and youll gain 2 fire damage
putnam tomorrow any advice besides sleep
if you had to change the calendar and it would be adopted everywhere what would it look like how many days/months
  
  why ask reddit 
it would be 13 months long every month would be exactly 4 weeks popular vote decides the new months name october would return to being the 8th month just because
each day would be at least 72 hours long 24 is too short cant get anything done

how does a rocket do its hoverslam calculations
  feedback control
calc 1 here im no expert but i have only a week left in my calc class id probably say it has something to do with the fact s1/2at2atso which can be found taking the second integral of acceleration find out the acceleration and then i would know
  it knows where it is because it knows where it isnt
  classic
  engie here just guessing most probably by an onboard realtime computational device with feedback loops from sensors attitude altitude gps gyro etc  same way your drone lands in front of you when you push rth/rtl two miles out it knows where to go in what attitude and knows the controls and engines characteristics to efficiently close the gap in a recursive manner
you can do a simple approximation with the rocket equation derived from f  ma granted to solve it analytically you ignore drag and to set it down lightly you have to be able to engineer a constant acceleration from your thrust
kalman filters breh
very carefully
  yeah only theres more to it than that because it also needs to know things like how much it weighs because that then also leads into how much energy it needs to negate to get to stop  so yeah  too

  doesnt really need to know weight if at current acceleration it calculates it will go positive vertical velocity before touching 0 altitude it increases thrust if at max thrust it calculates it wont make 0 vertical before touching 0 altitude it diverts heading so it crashes into water no weight necessary just acceleration distance till landing and time until empty if it knows all engines lit are operating at desired capacity then it knows thrust force and it measures acceleration with accelerometer so it can derive its own mass
  decreases thrust  the point of hoverslam is kinda you go max thrust all the way until just above surface if it calculates it will hover too soon it lowers thrust
  100 programmers   really small for the stuff they do  nah
  scott manley did a few videos on this stuff im not going to explain to you go watch some videos
  i watch plenty of scott manley if you didnt want to have a conversation why bother replying

how did we get from breakfast is the most important meal in the day to its best to skip breakfast    seriously 10 years ago i was seeing articles everywhere about scientific studies confirming the wonders of breakfast and lots of small meals during the day    nowadays i keep seeing articles about how great fasting is and that we should be hungry for long periods during the day again confirmed by scientific studies    i also remember reading lots of articles about how we should avoid meat as much as possible and now i see things like paleo diet carnivore diet becoming more and more popular    whats going on
welcome to memedicine
the vast amount of people who make money on attracting peoples attention have long realized that everyone needs to eat most people arent in great shape and thus its pretty easy to get clicks/views/readers by writing about new eating fads     also popular doesnt by any means imply representing the best scientific knowledge it would be a good exercise to check these scientific studies that the health magazine 9002 claims exist and look at their methodology or indeed whether such a study was every actually conducted and concluded anything like what the article writers imply    im 97 sure that paleo and carnivore diets are basically just memes fasting i dont know about i do know that how often you eat will have an effect on how your blood sugar varies throughout the day at least because that used to be an issue for me    i sometimes feel shitty if i skip breakfast and have to delay lunch so i prefer having at least some form of breakfast beyond that i just try to eat around 2000 kcal per day which is mostly achieved by eating two hot meals a day breakfast and minimizing snacks and unnecessary shit outside of that    basically dont be a giant retard and youll probably be just fine
  how did we get from breakfast is the most important meal in the day to its best to skip breakfast  food scientists do not use the scientific method
  i split my text in paragraphs to avoid a wall of text
  a sentence is certainly not a paragraph
  the annoying thing is that diets arent a blanket rule for everyone people react differently to different diets for a variety of reasons some of which are genetic as long as youre eating healthy in general then ignore all these meme diet studies and find what works best for your body
i recommend reading this book its focused on the uk because thats the authors experience but reflects wider trends its also mostly about medicine but also touched upon health fads    further its quite entertaining      durr any spacing is reddit spacing
  the jews are trying to bamboozle us try adopting a preindustrial diet and avoiding all processed foods you should feel your testosterone levels rising and your mind getting sharper also avoid the tap water
  nutrition is mostly pseudoscience its hard to do controlled long term studies of human diet so nutrition mostly doesnt bother to
nutrition as a field almost entirely dominated by shills for the various sectors of big agro literally dont believe anything you hear when it comes to food
  breakfast is the most important meal was literally cooked up as a marketing campaign back in the early 1900s
  studies are studies and can get mixed results as time passes for various reasons just do whats convenient for you i would love to have a nice warm breakfast every morning but i find getting my ass up and out to start my day is more important
  good advice hidden behind antisemitic rhetoric    its a refreshingly familiar reminder of where i am    tips fedora
  fasting in the morning unless its confounded by weight loss / a caloric deficit hasnt been shown to have any metabolic benefits probably because it fucks up your circadian rhythm etrf on the other hand has    small proteinrich meals spread throughout the day as opposed to a large one or two is useful to maximize muscle protein balance because of the muscle full effect it was originally thought this would be helpful in everyone but it doesnt seem to matter unless you have another anabolic stimulus on top like a heavy exercise regime so it only really applies to athletes and bodybuilders
  whats wrong with tap water and why is water from a plastic bottle better
feels good to be able to eat as much junk food as i want a never work out while still remaining lean and slim thanks to my superior lanklet genes  also food medicine is a meme theyre flip floppity like pancakes disregard what they say and eat according to what your body best responds to
  i have never seen any articles telling me to skip breakfast  but yeah breakfast is important and it should be full of protein
  im so young that i think plebbit invented paragraphs  leave
  tap water purity varies based on your local infrastructure depending on where you live it can be pretty gross also people are concerned about the fluoride that some municipalities add and the trace amount of pharmaceuticals that might be finding their way into their local water source mountain spring water is supposed to not have these issues bottled purified water on the other hand might be filthier than your local tap
  paleo is simply eating what your body has developed in harmony with since the start of life instead of eating things like processed food eg white flour and fake sugars  also make sure its fresh  i am very healthy since i started eating as close to paleo as i can the next step is trying to eat crickets and woodlice and shit sounds gross but it is shown that its good for your gut because thats what we grew up with if its good for your gut its good for your mind body and being
  a single sentence does not constitute a paragraph you inbred braindead nigger
  it purports to be but really we have little record of the diet of prehistoric humans so a lot of guesswork is required its save to assume high protein paleo meatheads are eating way more meat than early humans who successful hunted large game about once a week
  depends where you are and what local water quality is like   some places with really old pipes can have a lot of nasty heavy metals in it and not all water treatment is the same   i mean you wouldnt drink tap water in flint michigan would you   id suggest getting a water filter either a simple one with a pitcher or attached to the tap or even one for the whole house no reason to not drink water that is as clean as possible
  turns out nutritionist arent practitioners of science i guess theyd be nutriologists if they were   i wanted to know if powdered green vegetables with a little water/milk was less nutritious than eating actual veggies complete with their water content that makes them tedious to eat  two articles consulted nutritionists who gave their firm opinion that no its not as nutritious you cant just have the powder its better to change your diet to include lots of fresh vegetables now at this point any practitioner of science would provide a reason from either evidence or logic the nutritionists fuckouttahea because fresh just the best because less processed is always prefereable that was it i was supposed to take that as sufficient reason to expend 50x more time chewing down vegetables which of course means id just not eat them at all    theres that and the whole fat is bad eat more sugar instead paid shilling that shows even the ones who are scientists are fucks
  by posting this you are making reddit spacers realise that theyre reddit spacing which defeats the purpose keep letting them give themselves away to us real og oldfag 4channers
  it could be were it written by faulkner
  by wkkellogg
  i had a bio professor that used to say the half life of any wellaccepted nutrition theory is about 5 years
  onions is becoming sentient
  yes it does you utter moron
  us real og oldfag 4channers  cringe
  breakfast is important to give you energy for the day dont eat it and no matter how much you eat for lunch youll be tired     that said eating 16 hours a day isnt great either so ideally youd eat breakfast and then stop eating about 8 hours later so itd be skipping dinner and having a bigger lunch
   is simply eating what your body has developed in harmony with since the start of life  my life is the one of apes 20 000 years ago    okay
  theres a fair point to be made about over use of double returns but accusing every single instance as being a redditor is just inane    and if its because it pisses off phone posters because they have to scroll more    thats a plus in my book    fuck phone posters and their telltale 50 character replies
  thanks to my superior lanklet genes  you must be younger than 30 enjoy it while it lasts i was you once
nutrition isnt science just look at the fat free fad and the damage that meme has done
  nutrition science is a complete meme eat home cooked meals and avoid shit like soda and twinkies and youll be fine
  apes 20 000 years ago  youre a fucking moron
  hello /r thedonald tryhard
  i was being fucking ironic you fucking retard thats another way to spot newfags they dont realise the subtle irony in 4chan posts made by oldfags we realise that communication on this site should always be expected to be tongue in cheek to some extent the fact that this most users on this site now dont seem to realise this is indicative of the sheer newfaggotry that has overrun this place since 2016 as a newfag yourself you wouldnt know but to an real oldfag like me the change is visible and it fucking sucks
  yikes please take your 4chan shit elsewhere ok we here at 4channel dont appreciate anyone associated with the shithole that produced /pol/ and /r9k/
  they need to sell things are you retarded
yeah its meaningless breakfast being the most important meal of the day was propagated industries who realized people were eating lighter breakfasts now this whole skipping breakfast thing is likely the work of startup cafes who want you to spend a ton on lunch    any part of nutrition science that isnt a matter of biochemistry and calories is to be ignored your metabolism is genetic and it is not something that can be gamed just start with three meals a day and find out what works for you
  you mustve been to reddit to know it from somewhere dumbfuck hitting eneter twice to make visual separation of content is natural and you fucking degenerate credit that to reddit
  the food pyramid and breakfast being important was invented by cereal companies to sell more of their products
  wow im a redditor and i dont even have a reddit account
  cereal companies  implying the entire modern food industry is not a state run monopoly  lol
  newfaggotry that has overrun this place since 2016  ask me how i know you joined the site in 2015
  im not a newfag been here over 10 years im gonna assume you are though considering how easily you got super asspained please control your emotions little guy its embarrassing
what about the idea that you need to eat breakfast in order to properly control your glucose levels
  what was the point of this post the user youre responding to is obviously referring to the short sentences/paragraphs in the op not sentences in general yet you decide to reference faulkner for what reason exactly to let everyone know how culturally advanced you are how underage are you
    ever heard of trolls trolling trolls trolling trolls fucking pseudooldfags
  not a false statement
breakfast is not only unnecessary but consider what most people eat for breakfast and youll realize its processed sugar garbage
  if you hunt a large game per week you have hundreds of pounds of meat per week so if they were doing that modern paleo diets mostly pale in comparison in meat content
  no about a hundred not hundreds and shared between 2550 people thats 24 pounds per week
  i eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast
  unbelieveable how much of an outright lie this is and that the pyramid ought to be totally fucking inverted
  naw bro refined oils and red meat give you heart attacks and butt cancer there should just be a lot less bread and dairy
  mate game used to be a lot bigger and more frequent compared to modern day game look at the early herds of american buffalo as an exmple a tribe of 2550 people would absolutely have more than 100 pounds of meat per week what the fuck else were they eating berries and nuts and other scavangeable foods were fairly scarce and required lots of time for little reward not to mention a lot of theose were fucking tiny and low in nutrition compared to modern selectively bred versions a brief glance of the human digestive system will confirm this
  having done some research those are some pretty fucking tenuous links
  berries fruit nuts mushrooms bugs roots small game fair point about the hundreds i was basing that off of deer but indeed there was hella bigger game gathering was a lot of work and low reward but hunting also was a lot of work and low reward huge haul but a very low success rate life was kind of hard
  we should be hungry for long periods during the day    lol you deserve to starve if you believe anything people tell you especially in written and anonymous form
  humans have only been eating this much for the last 250 years  humans are shooting up in height  cancer and diabetes were basically nonexistent before the 1800s
  yeah bro 3 meals a day of processed grains has totally been the standard for human evolutionary history
fasting is good though delaying pleasure is good for discipline plus the weight loss
    yes for at least 500800 years     ever heard of windmills
   have only been eating this much for the last 250 years    citation needed    humans are shooting up in height    citation needed    cancer and diabetes were basically nonexistent before the 1800s    both develop usually at an older age that throughout history most couldnt reach
  breakfast is the best   it was created by corporations to sell more bacon and eggs
  the only person i see acknowledging this is ray peat
    as a way to cure masturbation and the many ills he thought it produced
  because people that think they understand statistics dont understand statistics
  sup    hows it going man    hey    what you said about phoneposters really offended me    i think you would really feel sorry about you said if you knew the effect it had on me    please apologize    or i will begin crying
  and now i jerk off onto my corn flakes to prove him wrong
  never knew what reddit spacing was  now i can realize how retarded this accusation is who writes in a block of text you always leave a full lines between paragraphs in text based communication especially on 4chan why because you cant indent    wow
  phone posters and their imagejpgs are the worst
  its the muh sekrit club thing reddit is for normies who actually want everyone to read everything they say so its a reddit thing to have easy to read posts
  anyone who falls for the reddit spacing meme is a newfag
  evolutionary changes work on the scale of hundreds or even thousands of years
can we extrapolate from this to say that all idw figures are brainlets and charlatans        this weinstein guy is aggressively stupid as is his brother but at least hes doing it for his valley billionaire paymasters
  not gonna watch all that give me the tldr
  among other things bret rejects mathematical modelling where it isnt immediately intuitive dawkins can hardly believe how stupid this is    the he bret tries to explain every event in history through a darwinian framework dawkins makes the blindly obvious point that history is driven by all sorts of factors    at a point dawkins clearly just wants to stop talking to this idiot
how would you introduce technology of any form even chocolates to the sentinelese tribe without getting murdered  i personally think its inhumane to leave these guys on their small shitty island
kill them all
  i personally think its inhumane to leave these guys on their small shitty island  yeah better turn the island into another third world slum
  i personally think its inhumane to leave these guys on their small shitty island    fuck off theyre a nature preserve
  give them syphilis and wait for them to come and ask for help
  3rd world is better than eating literally nothing but coconuts all day spending an average of 100 hours a week doing basic shit to survive they literally have the worst standard of living on this planet
  i would give them the tech of a ac130 gunship pulverising them whilst blasting nins further down the spiral from speakers build a resort on the land
  yet theyre happy
  heres a better question why should you or anyone  those on the island included  give a fuck
      a robot
  i would really pay to get one of these guys out and teach them how to speak english and then have a tv show where the host explains this man some of the bizarre concepts of the modern world women having rights etc and just seeing what this person thinks i can already hear him say what do you mean you cant just kill your wife if she refuses to suck your dick god dammit someone make this happen    it would be bringing a caveman to the modern world and having him react to all of our modern bullshit that absolutely makes no sense but is a logical byproduct of technological advancement
just parachute shit by plane they wont be able to refuse until it ruins them then write a shitty best selling novel about the dystopia you created within the tribe
  theyre not savages you ignorant racist they dont treat their women like slaves and they know about how the outside world is more technologically advanced theyre not retards
  im not agreeing or disagreeing with you but i have to ask how do we know theyre happy
  none of that has anything to do with i was saying i really cant tell if you were trying to make a point or just had a fucking stroke
  i can already hear him say what do you mean you cant just kill your wife if she refuses to suck your dick
  spider alert  theyre retards
  i personally think its inhumane to leave these guys on their small shitty island    oh look its someone who has never heard of self determination if their lifestyle is    a sustainable  and   b harms no one    then who gives a flying fuck what they do
  kek why is that farfetched there are literal people that are much higher on the techtree than them muslims that still treat their women like that womens rights are a very very first world concept that only the warped mind of a society made complacent by abundant goods could create i am not saying these goodlooking gentlemen are savages i am saying they dont live in a society of abundant resources
  women having rights etc      a woman is seen pulling a man back so i dont think woman have no rights or anything close to that
  dude what if one of those guys really wants to jerk it to traps on /gif/ but because of his limited life experience he doesnt know that exists wouldnt you want to save that man what if it were you
  have a horrible shitty life and can be wiped out by a single bad storm  wwhy would you want to help the literal worst conditions on the planet  i would be willing to spend 5 a month sending these guys actual food
  kek that means nothing a woman in any society could do that that is still very inline with women being a support role
  except we already know their women do have rights and are not viewed as property
  no they dont what the actual fuck is your source for this
  kek
  kek
  there are lots of anthropologists who specializes in the sentinelese people your can find a lot of information about their society but your were too lazy to even to even do a basic google search and just reverted to your racist assumptions
drop off puzzle box  they spend hours trying to open it  finally smash it open  a single note inside  ur a faget  they wouldnt understand but that doesnt make it any less true
  have a horrible shitty life and can be wiped out by a single bad storm    you realize i mentioned sustainability right those guys have been there for millennia without being wiped out clearly they can survive just fine    also  i would be willing to spend 5 a month sending these guys actual food    so you admit that this isnt actually about helping them but about salving your white guilt
  i personally think its inhumane to leave these guys on their small shitty island  why i think its immoral to force them into the modern world let those fuckers just keep on doing what theyre doing
  white guilt  what no what would i have to be guilty about im not the one who placed them on that shitty island i just feel bad for anyone who has to eat literally nothing but coconuts all day and has to fuck their inbred wife with a mustache
  the only thing i can find is that only the men are allowed to use weapons which is a clear sign of women not having the same status this is a reasonable assumption as literally 999 of primitive societies worked this way and it has been less than a century since life got so good for us that we said fuck it lets give rights to women what is the worse that could happen
  they have wildlife and plenty of fish idiot
  have wildlife  very small amount read their actual report their diet is almost completely coconuts
  just because you have gender roles in society doesnt mean you are patriarchal or that strict about the gender roles
  im talking about the condescending sense of superiority that makes people like you feel that they need to help the poor dumb browns which most frequently manifests itself in the form of white guilt    they have been offered the benefits of modern society and said no that is their right
  they have been offered the benefits of modern society and said no   they are too ignorant to know what the benefits are they literally think all foreigners are evil
  sell them cocaine  for their women
people who hate the sentinelese are probably the same who force npc memes
  they know what the benefits are they see modern boats and they have been given modern things
  nobody hates the sentinelese lol why are sjw types always imagining nonexistent strawmen
  mostly because they dont live through the rat race of a life like we all do     free from work slavery wars governments gmo global warming vitamin d deficiencies and all that other crap sure having rules is important i guess they also have some kind of rules and basic communication     they are just focused on their tribe family and surviving in general who wouldnt be happy if most of their modern day problems would vanish why do you believe so many young people are eager to live somewhere far away from civilisation or see the story of into the wild as an inspiration
  the first post of this thread is kill them all five posts down from that anon want to kill them with a gunship are you fucking stupid
  how are they free from work slavery
  eating literally nothing but coconuts all day  they live in a completely wild island with animals to fish and hunt its not a coincidence they have bows and arrows  and no their standards of living arent bad at all
  well if you are able to warp your own perception of reality and pretend that it wasnt you who made those two posts then fair enough see a therapist and the reason i know it was you is because even if you are racists racists are only angry at black people for invading their societies even the most hardcore racists say that they would be fine if black people stayed in their country just like the sentinelese are doing if anything racists love these people so please stop larping on the internet thank you
  everyone who disagrees with me is the same person
  at the very least they dont seem to display the basic symptoms of depression or anxiety    3rd world is better than eating literally nothing but coconuts all day spending an average of 100 hours a week doing basic shit to survive  yes because working 40 hours a week commuting another 1020 dealing with the stress of social pressure and ruthless competition is so much better than that never mind the fact that their diet is probably more varied than yours and going by anthropological research they work far less than 100 hours a week in fact play and leisure are very important for these cultures    im not saying their lives are better or that id like to live by then but i dont see any objective measure by which their lives are worse other than life expectancy but even their lives are probably free of a lot of first world diseases such as  depression  myopia   postural diseases such as back pain  social anxiety  being socially clueless difficulty in finding sex partners  stress  diabetes  sleep problems  and i could probably go on if i really tried    you have no moral ground to say theyre better off living in mainland india or even in a first world european country
  pretend that it wasnt you who made those two posts then fair enough  so i made those posts an hour ago and waited to complain about them youre out of your fucking mind lmao
  they dont think that tech they think thats evil demon shit
    /thread
  i cant just murder someone who comes into my house we have global laws
  i mean its kind of the redundancy of modern work isnt it youre forced to work in an office job mostly just swiping numbers left and right or writing bills not seeing a physical outcome of your time and work input   working for someone else so they increase their yearly net worth   in comparision these people are working for their own  or their tribe the efforts of every person is needed for the tribe to sustain    wouldnt you be overall happier if you had the chance to live with 100 orher people in a small area everyone is working is order to ensure that the village has enough food / water / protection not bound to money  social constructs / or foreig governments that you have no insight of just your people trying to survive on basic needs
  on 4chan yes because you people are a minority so you just bomb all threads with your retarded sjw logic
  if anything racists love these people  i must be racist then
  they literally are retard iq savages
  everyone who disagrees with me is an sjw
  i can murder someone who bursts into my house uninvited
  yikes lurk more or go back to whatever shithole you came from newfag
  be uncontacted tribesman  live in mud hut hunt and gather to survive  die at 35 from an infection or getting eaten by a tiger    get introduced to the outside world  too retarded to function in modern society  die at 35 from alcoholism    just leave them alone
  youd probably start by regularly dropping supply crates to them full of good food do it often enough that they cant miss the fact that the flying metal rotarybird is the one giving them the shit then after a long time maybe like a year of doing that to build trust land and make contact    of course this would probably result in them all dying of disease unless you got doctors over there too not unlike how the native americans did but at least it might be peaceful
  they gain nothing from this
  roll up wearing a modernized version of full platemail and a pump shot gun with bean bags after you prove that you are physically superior you begin the uplifitng process best way would be a whole squad of platemail shotgun wielders
  how did the tiger get on the tiny island
  edgy and the most boring option why not put them against each other in a battle of wits and endurance allowing the best to take a harem of the women they choose
  but why
  why do these threads always devolve into 14 year old autistic power fantasies       i smell secret craving for cuckblacked porn here
  this is a good plan
  its just how i would do it really they should be left alone but we should put trail cams and bugs in their camps so we can watch their culture develop
  you may be right about some things but their health is definitely not very good reminds me of kontiki they reached some polynesian islands which while not exactly uncontacted they had no access to civilization they certainly were happy on average but the kontiki crew realized a lot of them had all kinds of easily treatable infections and diseases the crew become loved by everyone on the island because they saved a child and cured a lot of people even as something as harmless as an ingrown hair can become nasty if left untreated they would definitely benefit from better healthcare
  diseases are good for them natural population control and eugenic selection
  starvation would fix overpopulation even if they had no disease
  youd have to be a real special kind of contrarian to say that the kind of contrarian one would expect from 4chan youre like the prototypical user from this website needless to say your argument is retarded
  starvation is the sign of a falling/destroyed ecosystem  once they begin to starve their island will no longer be inhabitable
  ur dumb
  taking anons seriously  the problem with fags like you is that you found 4chan and believed it wasnt a joke because of people like you there are all these boogeyman stories about the chans
  dont underestimate the edginess and idiocy of the average 4chan user
  yes thats pretty much what i said your kind of primitivism is something only an edgy kid would argue for youre like the anarchist who calls 911 when hes in trouble you only argue for primitivism because youre sheltered there are better ways to control the size of the population other than lack of healthcare
  it swam
  there are better ways to control the size of the population other than lack of healthcare  they dont need better ways because theyve been doing just fine for thousands of years while you get replaced in your own home country by the same third worlders you created
  being ironic and joking about everything isnt a healthy way to live anon
  thinking that you can uplift and bring enlightenment to brown people just so you can be praised as their savior is no less of an autistic power fantasy
  if you really feel that way why are you even lurking this site
  what the fuck does that have to do with anything are you even capable of following a single train of thought without rambling on about politics you said they were free of health issues and i argued that by extrapolating what we know from similarly isolated tribes that their health isnt as good as you put it then you went full edge
  porn sexdolls and mega vibrationg schlongs
  he thinks this mongolese furry fandom forum is not filled with edginess and idiocy  welcome to 4channel
  what the fuck does that have to do with anything  no civilization  no skyrocketing population  no depletion of their natural environments and loss of their innate huntergatherer abilities  no mass mortality  another human pest avoided  im sorry your brain only works in binary and youre incapable of understanding consequences and implications  you said they were free of health issues  no
  nostalgia      i think we should just let them be animals and not bother them
  i personally think its inhumane to leave these guys on their small shitty island  its even more inhumane to introduce them to technology read the unabombers manifesto
  then what did you mean by   governments gmo global warming vitamin d deficiencies and all that other crap  you clearly implied that they are healthier unless you think that getting an infection is a good thing as long as youre not vitamin d deficient also the fact that you think governments and gmos are a bad thing says enough about you
these people live in perfect harmony with nature and are literally an example to follow for all of us
  nostalgia  fuck me too anon
  thats another anon although i agree with his conclusion that they overall live a good enough life that would be wrecked by civilization

meanwhile in the mind of a sentalise    these white devils   they bring book and speak of spirits  ayayayayyyayayayayayayayayya  they ride upon steel whales   we cannot penetrate their hide      i say drop them an audio box sterilized with a big red button and indestructable water proof steel frame with a heartfelt explanation in their own language and wait a few years till they catch up to us
    they keep shooting anyone who goes near their island with arrows i really cant think of a plainer way to say fuck off and leave us the hell alone  regardless of whether they are happy or unhappy they have every right to maintain their purity and isolation whereas globalists like you have absolutely no right to infringe upon that and will deservedly be shot with arrows if you attempt to
  porn
  oh dont be silly anon theyre not white they lack the mental capacity to make that decision luckily its being made for them theyll receive the bounties of liberalism and in a few years theyll look back on their savage barbarism with disgust     just think another beautiful liberal democracy with voting and cellphones
  you have to be 18 or older to post on this site
  whats the big red button for
  its to replays the audio
  perhaps they wouldnt attack if we sent beautiful white women as a welcome gift instead of ugly nerds with glasses
  how the hell are you gonna find someone who speaks sentalise
  just send these little guys to roll around observe and learn their language sterilized of all biological hazards of course
  i would introduce them to machine guns firing them honestly kill yourself cucks just kill the monkeys and you hav the island for yourself
  3rd world is better   no it is not 3rd world is shit leave them alone or kill them is the correct option or maybe use them as slaves
  yeah they are literally savages means wild in latin  and no they are retards so they dont even know what are people around them using
  rc boat from legal distance     they look cold send blankets
nobody ever mentions that there is a neighboring island where a contacted tribe went from 9000 people to 200 because of our diseases
  that sounds like a good way to end up with a lot of decapitated bb8s why not use bird shaped drones to hide in trees
  theyll have to catch them first however that is probably a better solution
  3rd world is a lot better than having to fuck your inbred wife and literally live on dirt even the africans have farms huts fire shoes ect
    americuck
  t nogunz faggot
  as long as it works    engineer detected    fuck off back to /diy/
  its inhumane to introduce anything to our happy little world
military occupation and colonization
  standard of living / quality of life  what youre suggesting would actually drastically reduce their quality of life   they know about tech  you dont know that yeah they see planes and shit that doesnt mean they know what they are or why they exist  if they wanted to be part of this you think maybe they would be open to visitation by people who might bring them tech but they are clearly not they very obviously want to be left alone and you wish to selfishly deny them that
  they dont make the items you listed  assumes they must want them even though they havent made them  did you say earlier itt that they werent retarded it looks like youre now implying theyre too stupid to make shelter
  dont have the resources on their tiny island or the free time again they spend almost all of their time trying to survive off of small amounts of coconuts they literally sleep on the dirt and havent invented fire but no their life is amazing right
  you dont invent fire you discover it you also seem to think they dont have free time when youve been told on this thread that they have more free and leisure time than you do unless youre a neet you keep being told that youre stupid but you continue with your autistic shitposts
   when youve been told on this thread  source so far all i have read about them show they have nearly no free time only retards who live in the city think living on an island would allow you free time
  i read a post telling you exactly that that they work far less than people in the developed world its not hard to do a little internet research  sackett found that adults in foraging and horticultural societies work on average about 65 hours a day where as people in agricultural and industrial societies work on average 88 hours a day  their only real problem is their low life expectancy mostly due to lack of antibiotics and healthcare
  you just quoted something involving other tribes i am specifically talking about this tribe which has been observed to have very little free time due to lack of resources
  they literally have the worst standard of living on this planet  if i had to choose between living like them or living like one of those coltan mining nigglets id choose the former without thinking it twice
  i am specifically talking about this tribe which has been observed to have very little free time due to lack of resources  observed by whom all evidence suggests they live leasurely hunter gatherer lives    this is from one of the few successful expeditions   found a group of 18 leanto huts made from grass and leaves and showing signs of recent occupation by an estimated 4050 people including fires roasted fish and wild fruits spears bows arrows and halfmade baskets  this shows no lack of food again their diet is probably better than yours    stop spewing bullshit or youll just keep on getting btfo
    theyre modern humans if you took a baby from them and had him be adopted by a normal couple hed be a completely regular human being dipshit
  is that really true even if you adopt a black baby he will still have lower than average iq
  reasonable assumption as literally 999 of primitive societies  no it is not    it is a reasonable assumption the women are protected in a small population from sudden death  also bearing arms is not a privilege to assume so is a retard way of thinking the need to carry arms is either enviromental instability and lack of safety or means for hunting food by lack of safety i mean there are nig aah i mean violent neighbourhood or other threats such as predatory animals or potential alein incursions    most european countries have started to include female workforce in law enforcement after ww ii as the male population had been depleted too severly to maintain all necesary functions  strongly sovinistic countries did this later than other in similar conditions    russians had women in their military in ww ii that is becuse 2 reasons they have a large population enough so that losing a few potential breeders wouldnt jeopardice the community and they didnt give a shit about womens rights    the fact that women today aer willing to go to sudden death situations instead of staying home is due to the change of worksaftey mostly would that not be so the womens rights movement would never have gone demanding such rights and yet in the most dangerous jobs today there is an extremely small persentage of women labour force shouldnt the quotas be met in those areas as well    as for the violent islanders with poor life do you need to go fucking up their life by pushing your standards in their face christian and muslim societeis are so self important that they dont see how fucked up they are specially the american nutts who do what they please and think theyre forgiven after their shit just by apologising    the only good reason to go there would be to prevet extinction by inbreeding   to aproach them is simple do it like they do it on animal planet specifically the animal trainers gain trust estabilish communications gtfo end of mission
  cant find a free moment in 40000 years to develop basic necessities
    what would happen if this was done
  yes  yes
    theyve heard the legends about the scary white demons who travel to other lands to kill people and steal their stuff they dont want you on your island
  citation needed
just send 2 pigs with parachutes give the other infuleza the other lepper then wait 2 weeks and you will have no raecistance cure everyone with antibiotics and they think you are gods and do anything you say thats how they do in movies
  just leave em alone man they cant live in our society they seem happy enough probably happier than me
  i fucking hate the sentinelese people theyre like cats they think theyre so smart uh stupid little shits
  is that really true even if you adopt a black baby he will still have lower than average iq    that is not true iq is not hereditary only iq is largely affected by environmental conditions also white people and people living in cold areas are more intelligent because the stupid ones have died  warmer climate doesnt fawor the intelligence over fertility modern age brings people from warm areas to cold places only to meet cultural obstacles since the society has evolved to such that prevents stupid ones from dying
  intelligence is actually just the results of socioeconomic differences  except in whipepo where it was naturally selected
  thanks
  he/she would propablyand i mean statistically have marginally bellow that societys average iq  given sufficient education he/she would rise above average american iq with no dificulty
  he/she  did you get lost on your way to reddit
how did this thread get so derailed    how would you introduce technology of any form even chocolates to the sentinelese tribe without getting murdered    armor for fucks sake recall the conquest of the known world by europeans you just walk straight at them arrows bouncing off and then hack and slash with the broad sword until you have their undivided attention       i personally think its inhumane to leave these guys on their small shitty island    the small shitty island is the size of manhattan
whats up with the obnoxious furry poster running around /sci/
  what is reddit
  the small shitty island is the size of manhattan  so you concur right it is small shitty island
  nobody outside the island speaks their language we dont even had a clue what it branched off of other than heaps of fucking arrows theres not a whole lot of communication they are fascinating in the regard they speak a completely unique language
  17 million people live on manhattan its breddy big
  a battery powered very loud speaker probably reinforced also buttons maybe they can push to play certain sounds just to see if they make music or something idk
  music didnt exist before electronics  i hate this generation
  its breddy big  its 23 square miles and about 13 miles at the longest two point you could get across it with a leisurely walk in an afternoon   it has so many people because the entire city is vertical   most of the big cities full of sky scrapers and high rises arent like that because they have a choice theres usually geographical barriers that prevent outward expansion   compare chicago la houston to new york tokyo or hong kong   the first three have some big buildings down town but are otherwise characterized by sprawl the others are islands or pinned in by mountains and the sea so you have nowhere to go but up
  who are you quoting retard
  desire to make contact
  you cant  you cant even get them into the bronze age if there isnt any copper/tin ore on that little island
  you could try to introduce them to christianity
  this
    uncontacted people occasionally come to us first seeking to be introduced to the luxuries of the modern world theres literally nothing stopping these people from entering global society and we shouldnt feel morally obligated to pull them into it
  id give them a chemical explosive that covers their island killing all of them
  alleviating suffering is moral
  those are reasons you think they should be happy not any evidence of whether they are actually happy
  seriously want makes you think it inhumane why must we bring technology to them is advanced technology the only indicator of wealth sometimes i think a lot of what the unabomber wrote about rings true modern life brought a lot of good things but some bad also ive gone on a few trips for a few days each living in a cabin with no electricity i only had a few things to keep me occupied including reading meditation archery eating and sleeping while this may seem boring and coming from someone who has always loved technology gadgets video games etc those days in simplicity were the most content i have ever been in my life being in the middle of nowhere dipping your body in a cool winding river on a hot summer day while the sun shines through the tree leaves are the most beautiful moments of my life i can guarantee these primitives are a lot happier and content than a great majority of the overindulging citizens in the developed world just leave them be
  environmental conditions  explain the minnesota twins study then
  maybe theyre just coocoo for coconuts
  i would firstly introduce them to the wonders of the atom
  tfw got a response from sam anally trained hyde
  the fuck you want him to do come over there and ask em hey motherfucker are you happy     honestly im jealous of them a nice comfy island where all their ancestors have lived for thousands of years their own traditions rituals tales passed down from generation to generation daily life consisting of just hunting for food exploring the island or sitting around the fire with your immediate family probably only live to forty but i bet you they die content knowing they fulfilled their role and have sons or daughters that live on     when we separated ourselves from the environment that we evolved in for thousands of years is when begun to be more unhappy in general
  primitive technology makes it look fun
  speakers only play music  it is a replacement for our vocal cords which are fragile and very loud so they cant possibly ignore it the buttons would be to see how they experiment with a device they cant break electronics are also more flexible than say a piano what if we recorded sounds they made broke those up into words and assigned them to buttons you can do more experiments with the speaker than you can by just handing them a violin
  napalm
  i think they know how to light a fire
the sentinalese were contacted they know about our technology or at least about our food helicopters and weapons and have no interest in it leave them alone fags
  leave them be they would probably die off due to not being a immune to modern disease
  would it be illegal to rape one if you somehow made it to the island
  i personally think its inhumane to leave these guys on their small shitty island  if you are murrican i would say muh freedom that would be enough to not go there  how would you introduce technology of any form even chocolates to the sentinelese tribe without getting murdered   parachute isnt it fucking obvious
  cure everyone with antibiotics and they think you are gods  oomba magoomba you bring us pestilence and now you bring us help we rape you til you die  they are like niggers why the fuck would they cooperate
  this
  break a leg  die  get a cold  die  get cancer  die  get to middle age  die  offend big juju  die  get a cut  die    what an enviable life
  yes theyre under the protection of the indian government and youll be prosecuted that is if the sentinelese warriors didnt crucify you first which of course they would
  they reject all forms of technology and contact so let them do what they doi would give em a shitload of compound bow with heavy ass draws and modern fiberglass arrows with hunting broadheads  they will never be invaded
  i cant just murder someone who comes into my house  obviously killing them wouldnt be murder
  regardless of whether they are happy or unhappy they have every right to maintain their purity and isolation whereas globalists like you have absolutely no right to infringe upon that and will deservedly be shot with arrows if you attempt to  but when people use this line of thinking for a whites only restaurant they suddenly dont have the right to purity and isolation at all why is that from your perspective it certainly cannot be due to utilitarianism or else we should have concluded we need to help the isolated tribes people in the first place because the greatest good would be helping them achieve a more modern quality of life     if you believe that the sentinelese tribe has a right to isolation do you believe in freedom of association and thus people should be able to make racially isolated establishments
  you got a problem with coconuts
  if you believe that the sentinelese tribe has a right to isolation do you believe in freedom of association and thus people should be able to make racially isolated establishments  yes  i am already a hardcore nationalist and nativist so you are barking up the wrong tree my friend
  when you are as muscular as them then you can talk about how unhealthy they are
  get shot  die
    wouldnt you be overall happier if you had the chance to live with 100 orher people in a small area everyone is working is order to ensure that the village has enough food / water / protection not bound to money  social constructs / or foreig governments that you have no insight of just your people trying to survive on basic needs    no
        diseases such as back pain   anxiety   socially clueless difficulty in finding sex partners       problems    stop talking about yourself
        diseases such as back pain   anxiety   socially clueless difficulty in finding sex partners       problems    you share the board with these reclusive wrecks
  i would bet a million these guys have higher baseline happiness levels with their simplistic lives than the average office drone has in the modern world    not even being edgy the higher your sentience the higher the incidence of depression and overall dissatisfaction these mongs have a clear purpose and structure to their lives in the jungle hunting  gathering and theyre better of that way     man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so muchthe wheel new york wars and so onwhilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time but conversely the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than manfor precisely the same reasons
  we live in a society
  when do we ship off
  i personally think its inhumane to leave these guys on their small shitty island  we have no business interfering with lessdeveloped societies no matter how we may look at them nonintervention is the best way to deal with this we let them be
who is in the wrong here
  not true dolphins are smarter because they also live longer
  just send in drones to learn their language   i am sure they could observe them long enough to see them pointing at rocks and counting them or something like   said
  
  by dropping a b61 on their island    fuck em
  the stupid christcuck of course
  why are you so violent anon
  they killed a fellow citizen and need to pay
  they killed an invader to their land so idk what youre talking about even so you want to nuke their whole culture for the simple fact that they are too based yikes
  that citizen said in his journal to not be angry at the tribe should he be killed and not to recover his body
  option 1 improve the lives of hostile 100th world peoples  option 2 kill said people and utilize their land and resources for yourself    hmmm
  theyre not savages    they are the literal definition of the term savage
  drop ak47s with barrel drums holding 400 rounds each with the safety removed and tracer rounds    they will love them
these checkers have had plenty of time to observe boats and planes and have occasional contact with other tribes that have contact with the outside they are obviously not interested it is not like they are completely ignorant of there surrounding world
  how would you introduce technology to the sentinelese    abduct one at night and anal probe him
  oh those poor things they are naked you know what they would really need clothes every month we should air drop our donated clothes on the island
  inhumane  sapiens  yuval noah harari  kike but has some shit to say about this and other memes
  what youre suggesting would drastically reduce quality of life  if they wanted this they would be more open  they very obviously want to be left alone  denying them that is selfish  dont you know that we live in an increasingly globalized society just because some people are afraid of change doesnt mean that we should accept arguments rooted in xenophobia migration is a human right and we must not allow our biases and insecurities lead us to reject progress in favour of reactionary isolationism a borderless world is inevitable and interbreeding will bring an end to race and racismquality of life is no excuse for clinging to outdated westerncentric norms which uphold normative whiteness through paranoia and division its time to stop giving in to fearmongering and realise that the impending extinction of humanity and irreversible destruction of our planet is unavoidable unless we immediately come together as one and embrace diversity  buildbridgesnotwalls  diversityisourstrength
  consider the following they think the planes are sky demons
  blah blah
  i personally think its inhumane to leave these guys on their small shitty island    educate your country niggers first
  like all of africa they wanted for nothing before the western induced population boom  leave them the fuck alone
  depression is literally nonexistent among tribal communities that live off the land
99 chance op is some oversocialized semitic fuck that literally cant stand the idea that there are people out there living happily and free of technological and debt slavery
  dude you are a fucking retard and should consider lurking more
1 gameshow introduce foes to the island starting with small predators and ending with robots  2 bomb the island around them continually and then send in like five helicopters playing the ride of the valkyries and then shoot them the fuck up  3 take camera shots of tribesmen and abduct them then put those pictures in glass boxes and watch them try to free the souls of the capitves
  why would you want to introduce tech and knowledge to an interesting research opportunity
  yeah just like homosexuality is non existent in iran     stop with this primitive people cant be unhappy meme bullshit they have no depression reporting system you have no fucking idea if they are happy or not
  they know exactly what they are when they killed a couple of fisherman the authorities tried to retrieve the bodies by luring them away with helicopters while others retrieved the bodies it worked once then they split the tribe up to chase the heli and guard the other body while jeering at the helicopter they are not stupid they know about our tech they are probably just amish
  people have left gifts on the beach countless times they only take the cookware
primitive tribal life in the pacific free from the burden of knowledge is literally the most optimal way in which a human can exist
  consider the following they think they are scaring off the sky demon and thus put on a brave warriors face  come the fuck on anon they are like children adam and eve scenario
  you  
  small shitty island  they should be left alone its wrong to ruin their culture
  gas them while sleeping  impregnate females with caucasian sperm  now their tribe can realign in gods image
  do you think these humans have consciousness
      something like this just drop it something when theyre not paying attention and let them learn by themselves maybe add some symbols to the items so they can learn and develop a formal language of their own
  please link some of this information senpai
  or maybe use them as slaves  until they inevitably die from introduced diseases and/or have their menial labor automated
  send them conquerers 2 at a time with progressively better tech  1 bronze swords shields  2 iron axes leather armor etc  25 polearms metal plate armor  3 a couple of guys with muskets and sabres  4 one marine  5 heli drop ipads loaded with pornography and sugarbased processed food
  conquer their minds through pornography
drop drugs pornogrpahy and lies to divide them as they do with you
i would mount the island using this  probably wit some form of combine harvester blades on the front to raze the forest and with an elite squad of rpg wielding white supremacists i would bring them banking and big agro and declare myself king
  in actual fact hunter gatherers work way less than we do we are the slaves to the dark beat
  yo guy send in paulies robot     
holy shit
  wouldnt you be overall happier if you had the chance to live with 100 orher people in a small area everyone is working is order to ensure that the village has enough food / water / protection not bound to money  social constructs / or foreig governments that you have no insight of just your people trying to survive on basic needs  if i wanted to do that i would just fire up dont starve together for a few hours
  he must have took the arrow getting blocked by the bible as a sign from god to continue trying to convert them that hed be protected
  indian govt  prosecuting rape  youll be fine
  dolphins cant do anything because their fins dont allow them to manipulate their environment their abstaining from waging wars and crafting stuff that eventually makes them unhappy is not a consequence of their wisdom
    you do know that dolphins engage in mass gang rapes right
dont the women on this island have amazing breasts like unbelievably perky
  based
  cant craft a tool and wield it with your dick
  lets say he wasnt shot with arrows can someone explain to me how this guy was so retarded that he thought he would be able to communicate anything to them
  why not
  they look like twigs running around and hunting is cardio it doesnt build muscles
  he thought hed eventually be able to live with them and learn their language he was planning on staying there for years dude was deluded as fuck
  youre wrong the sentinelese are completely isolated we have no idea how they treat their women or how they live or what language they speak their experience of the outside world consists of a few very rare encounters most of which have surely by now become legends
  so then theyll feel like theyre in a videogame with progressively tougher waves of invaders
  imagine having your life defined by your wikipedia article being a redirect to a subsection of the wikipedia page of some indigenous people
    meanwhile in the first world  
  100 hours a week  retard  huntergatherers work less than a modern fulltime goy
  acute autism
  what happened when saddam hussein isolated himself  what happened when the aztecs lived isolated  japanese indians red indians    white people dont respect others but want respect themselves
  gods word never reached the island  god wont damn them for rejecting it  this idiot brings gods word to them which they rejected and now theyll be damned
  nah man its not inhumane where else in the world are you allowed to fucking eat another person thats the price they pay they get to eat people but they must forgo modern life
study their language culture and mythos remotely using aerial surveillance  learn what their version of prophesied savior is like  make up and dress up  become god of the island  if youre lucky you will have a great simple life unlike the plot to pirates of the caribbean
  i dont think god will take his hymns and english quotes as his word theyre fine for now
    this is how i feel aswell after going through higher education and several jobs honestly the leasure life feels superior       too bad ive let myself become conditioned to be a goym cuck and its not that easy to undo
  huntergatherers work like 2 hours a day
  this
  spoke to them in xhosa  why did this idiot think speaking to a people near india in a bantoid language would work
basically with all this talk about the missionary going to north sentinel island and getting killed and such has really sparked my foreign fetish ive always had an enormous kink for fucking extremely foreign women specifically from extremely secluded/isolated areas the last time i fulfilled this fetish which was the best week of my life btw i went to an aboriginal settlement in central africa and essentially befriended a small tribe with food and with a very primitive gesturing language i essentially offered them more food if they were to trade me their youngest and prettiest virgins with enough finessing i managed i made wild love to the both of them for a week until i was done and sent them home with a goat and 10 jugs of water my only caveat was basically fear i understand that my diseases could kill those people and their tribe i dont really care about that i do care if i get sick with some sort of incurable disease though that they may have harbored for centuries i got lucky with those 2 african goddesses last time and didnt catch anything probably because their tribe was not nearly as remotes as the sentinelese anyway my question is can i fuck a sentinelese woman without catching any diseases     i also dont care about the legality of this so no need to educate me about that my process is clear just need an answer to the question is all thanks
  christtards have the same mentality as liberals towards dark minorities they naturally assume they are all nogs and in need of help
  did they have big titas
  ass was huge prolly c tits on both they were fucking tight though ill tell you that
  an overly simplistic idea yet the most mentally mature because of its efficiency and plain honesty
  hey kids want to see what missile is
  they actually dont have any coconut palms on the island so youre an even bigger fag
  you can just send technology there without humans transporting it but what would be the point    just leave them alone they will assimilate eventually
is this scifi or could this realistically be achieved within the next few decades creating an exact copy of myself memories and all
  it depends is it okay to kill the current you as part of the process
  i mean id prefer not to are you inferring teleportation
  definitely not within the next few decades its not far off that we could grow a clone of someone starting from birth but creating a fully functioning adult body by parts is not feasible right now also we barely know how memory works in the brain so i doubt wed be able to figure out how to transpose memories anytime soon
  what if we just kept making different people with the same implanted memories to see how they reacted
  no just to make it easier to have identical memories
  we dont know nearly enough about the brain to alter our own memories let alone transplant
why would you want a clone with memories  make on without a brain and harvest its organs
  its not completely unreasonable to think that within a century or two there will be the capability to create a practical copy of you meaning nobody from today would be able to reliably tell the difference it wont actually be exact though it could easily not be physically possible to make exact copies of anything on the scale of a human being just copies with better and better fidelity
  memories would be a whole different ball game woudnt it making an exact clone would be cool though especially if he got to grow up in a higher class than i got to he might be more successful
it is possible to make a baby who would have the exact same genes as you but cloning your current self with the same memories is far from possible with modern technology though possible in theory
  im not sure i want another awkward chucklefuck roaming the earth
do we have an image or map showing the true position of galaxies such as those in this image after accounting for the distance they traveled in the time it took for their light to reach us
  do we have an image or map showing the true position of galaxies such as those in this image    dont know probably but    after accounting for the distance they traveled in the time it took for their light to reach us    that actually wouldnt matter you just change the distances without redrawing the position of anything space expands uniformly
  after accounting for the distance they traveled in the time it took for their light to reach us    or if you werent talking about space expansion and meant where these galaxies moved or what happened to them before their photons got here who knows youll find out in billions of years or never if they are too far away that the light never gets here
  i know a website which offers exactly what youre looking for unofortunately im not at my computer right now    you can look for a realistic solar system map on google which might direct you to a website
ive decided im going to teach myself biology all the way through a college level as much as i possibly can assuming i dont even remember anything from highschool where is a good place to start/ what study materials do i need  pic unrelated
  biology is just organic chemicals which are just chemical physical particles which are just math
  biology is a large field so you would probably want to specialize in a specific area the standard recommendation for a general overview is campbell biology will cover more than what the average bio undergrad does if you go through the whole thing but its a large textbook its also important to note that a lot of biology is highly laboriented so you might want to buy some equipment and do the classic labs just to get some experience or just fuck around a bit its all learning
  epic reddit army
    came to recommend campbell intro biology through through intermediate micro undergrad physiology etc is easily understandable if you just read the textbook and memorize the important components late undergrad grad and medical school is just an elaboration and extension on the core material you learned  ie why medical school is essentially just rote memorization
  in grad school you should be comfortable with programming statistics bioinformatics and ideally both analytical and numerical approaches to modelling on top of your standard biology knowledge if you want to do serious research that is if you arent really supplementing your knowledge of the biology with these skills in grad school then you are doing it wrong imo
  im currently going through the dat boot camp bio section good way to get the basics down if you want to go into more depth go through campbells biology and then go into cell bio

what is the worst branch of mathematics and why is it analysis
  yes
pde/fluid dynamics  well adjusted socially but poorly dressed  analysis/probability  smelly chinese kids who do pen flips when they get stuck which is often  algebra  complete loons but passive enough  differential geometry  completely fabricate results in their field unable to explain a differential form in under a minute  number theory  very intelligent but fidgety spergs the lot
  worst branch of math knot theory  deemed physically irrelevant around 1895 still kicking  witten revived it in the 1980s and it got a major revival fucking douche
  the worst branch of mathematics is shit posting on /sci/
  what about combinatorics
analysis is the thinking mans branch algebra is the dictionary definition of autism
  analysis is baby tier   algebra is god tier
  ha ha ha i lernd that in high school
  no shittalking analysis in general   you may only shittalk numerical analysis and any other approximative maths
  xd dummy
  differential geometry   fabricate results in their field unable to explain a differential form in under a minute  they still have more papers than you
  analysis is a 30 page paper just to say a random number no one cares about is between 2/3 and 4/7
  t pic related
  worst branch is geometry  lines and triangles can kiss my ass fuck the greeks
  nobody studies combinatorics seriously and if they do theyre just cs retards

b10501  b10541  b10511    goddamn they just keep shitting out new boosters its gonna take to mid2019 for us to see regular use of sooty flightproven bois
  wheres the forest of once flown boosters being hidden i want to see that shit
god damn rodent food bars scrubbing my spacex launch 
  theyre scattered about some in texas some in florida some in hawthorn no one big warehouse full of them
  thatll be fun itll be like ssoa on steroids lots of payloads
  to ensure rapid reusability they need a stack of available boosters
gediumdedu    cool but there is a grammatical error on that page
  oh lol and they still think its happening in 9 hours
reusability is not yet proven and likely never will be stop spreading misinformation
  reusability is not yet proven  granted  and likely never will be  allow me to laugh at you
  yeah man the 50 they have already arent enough    reusability simply doesnt work truth hurts
  you are actually never going to see that because there arent enough potential missions for that and even less contractors who are willing to put their irreplaceable work load on a used rocket to save a few million
  except you know all those contractors who already have and will continue to do so
how long until elon is metooed
  they dont have 50 block 5s
  and even less contractors who are willing to put their irreplaceable work load on a used rocket to save a few million  if its good enough for nasa and the dod
  starlink
  i thought they wanted to mass produce block 5s now so that spacex can then shift those resources to its/bfr/starship asap the huge stock was needed in case their current/future customers dont want to jump on bfr early and theyll have ready stock to suit even expandable mission profiles

my college is allowing you to apply for any math class even if you dont have pre requisitesi am pretty bad at math and never got to calculus in high schoolso which math level should i go to i am thinking of doing either precalculus or calculus i will study a ton on khan academy beforehand plus my dad is an engineer so he can help me study if he has time

hello /sci/ this is a thread for the scientific investigation into the ufo phenomenon leave your ghosts reptilians and the rest at   the ufo phenomenon is peculiar in several ways  it has been recorded with both visual sightings and radar at once many times  hundreds of people have reported seeing a single object  objects have been regularly reported by meteorologists astronomers pilots and various other experienced individuals who would be less likely to take venus or other normal phenomena as something unexplainable  its worldwide and goes back at least 70 years and arguably much further  when project blue book studied twelve thousand cases approximately 2 had no known natural explanation  now either there really is something strange going on in which case it should be studied both as a scientific mystery and as a security threat or there is a mass delusion that afflicts multiple people in the same way at once in which case it should be studied as a neuroscience anomaly in either case it warrants further investigation    if you think this is all nonsense i recommend reading this page    some more resources          this is an /x/core site but it has so much stuff it might be worth examining anyway 
  kind of hard to do a lot of scientific investigation when its a phenomenon that occurs unpredictably and inconsistently
  the problem is actually that none of the data is available pretty difficult to do any kind of a study without any information
theres significantly more evidence for ghosts than ufos    both have substance and should be looked at
  everything /x/ related lacks proper research it doesnt have a method to study it as most science does even the soft ones like social sciences psychology
  hynek did a good attempt at studying ufos
what do you wish you did as a freshman in hs regrets
not watch anime and play vidya
lose my virginity   i regret trying since it obviously was irrelevant
  talk to more people despite my observations of how nearly everybody was a normie i wished i friended the geeks instead of the nerdvirgins american public schools are psychocide
learned how to not be autistic and romantically literate or at least not stalk my then crush i would have also selfstudied calculus to get a head start i got a c in calculus 1 because i slacked off as a college freshman so now i have to fight tooth and nail for bs in classes like analysis and algebra to make sure my math gpa isnt completely shit tier
  and how to be
  studied the effects of electricity and magnetism on biological systems got ahead of things on a local level
  spent more time in the gym and had taken my good grades in math and science as a sign that i should have pursued a degree in those subjects and not bought into the idea that i could start a business in the burgeoning weed industry in my state and just skate off of familial wealth until i found strong partners for my venture really regret what happened the following year socially not much i over performed considering my status before hs and wouldnt change anything other than having more sex with my gf and spending less time binge drinking
  they told me dont skip to trigonometry take algebra 2 you have time  i said can i just take both at once  they said no  the next year they let some fucking freshman do exactly that  i ended up needing to rush calc 3  lin alg  diff eq in the last year to be on any solid footing which barely anyone had even done at my school and god damn would it have been nice to have an extra year to get discrete and maybe an intro groups/rings/fields class done then i could have just focused on analysis the whole time at college at the moment i wasted most of my first year of undergrad on algebrashit which was required and idk if ill fit in all the analysis grad classes i want by the end  and all it would have taken is fucking trigonometry
  what is the appropriate meme for this type of person
i only attended high school for few months and dropped out because i got at some violent incident that almost made me be jailed  i got my high school certificate with 22 yo 
  hell yeah buddy way to go
i wish i fucking studied    but nonetheless what do i do now my best efforts are not enough now sunce i never managed to build a skill of discipline and focus i tear my ass apart for hours meanwhile my friends do necessary shit in one hour and quality cannot be compared my work always turns out to be trash in comparison to peers    what the fuck what should i do please anons help
  pay more attention in math every other subject was a breeze for me so i never developed good habits for learning about things that didnt click with me   i would also hit on bitches and maybe warn someone about 9/11 since i was class of 01
  what do you mean by this
wish i actually did anything that would lead to me graduating on time and no regerts except for one where i could have asked the biggest crush ive had to date to go to prom with me and even though i anticipated a no from the beginning i still feel like a dumb pussy bitch for that one also abusing opioids
  no regrets even though there are many things i wish i did differently study harder less video games more confident etc the two arent commensurate one is lamentation and the other is a confidence and willingness to negate the past crying over wasted time is only more wasted time      what you should do is imagine how much more regret you will feel in the future if you stop trying today
i dont regret shit my slacking off landed me meeting my wife whos parents are loaded and bought us an house and car shes getting her masters in biology and im getting my bachelors in ee  im 25 and shes 24
  wow so you profit of the wealth of others    any accomplishments youve done yourself tho here nobody cares if you have rich parents
taking care of basic grooming i was the middle of five kids with a low income single mother no one taught me pretty much any life skills we all were a bit rough looking and not in a good way simple grooming techniques would have been a large quality of life improvement
  nothing else i built solid social base taught myself electronics and programming got gf learned cooking went to gym a lot so now im ottermode without exercising
  why should he care what a bunch of neets on a taiwanese basket weaving forum think
  i dont regret shit  translation  im a writhing mass of ambivalence and deep down dont even know if i feel regret
  advanced autist
  score
  what do you wish you did as a freshman in hs  i changed my normal kid style clothes for punk rock style clothes and i started doing drugs and i moved to georgia hopefully
ask a psychology student anything
  are you doing it just because all the other psych majors are grills
  i used to be in really good shape kind of a jock got a lot of girls then i got really fat and stopped working out after college girls werent giving me the time of day when i hit on them so then i got skinny again and started banging hotties so basically your motivation should be pussy unless you are gayin which casedick imagine 3sums and suckin on titties and ass fucking chicks when youre working out that is what motivated me
  why are you posting in /sci/    you dont belong here
  it isnt a pseudoscience if you want to argue go right ahead    i intend to become a psychotherapist and spend my time helping people as this is both extremely lucrative and i spent my life working for peanuts in a demanding job and helping people is what makes me feel alive    that is why
  it isnt a pseudoscience  it is im not a psychology student i have already studied it  get out of there asap
  unsurprisingly all the male psychologists i know are gay
  science is all about not agreeing without reason take any field experts never agree on much which is normal and healthy    psychology is a science simply because it relies on scientific principles to move forward the fact that its object of study is more complex than physics or chemistry doesnt make it a nonscience    a pseudoscience is a discipline that claims to be a science but fails to prove itself and fails to use the scientific method because if they did theyd basically sabotage themselves such as astrology psychology can show solid evidence of what it suggests since it works as a science
  boy you are in for a ride  as i said it is a pseudosciencie replicability but it likes to tryhard an yell that psychology is a science as much as physics so they dont have to admit how much they owe to papa freud  im learning a trade right now i wont find job as a psychologist and i dont want to be related with that wannabe science and a rotten academic world
  ive already checked the stats on this median salary for the job i want is 9k a month i will not be disappointed i make about half of this currently    would you be disappointed with 9k a month
i dont think psychology is a pseudoscience it just a discipline of a differente kind like philology    science is all about trying to explain the nature what we call science is what a century ago the called natural philosophy  and psychology dont try to explain nature simple as that
  psychology dont try to explain nature  are humans not part of nature
  psychiatry is a science    psychology isnt
  are you confused i asked a yes or no question
  do you wish to become the alpha male in your household so that you may safely proceed to have sexual relations with your mother
  ok  are humans not part of nature  of course    but psychology doesnt study the humans like part of the nature even the term psyche means something incorporeal
  the psyche is an abstraction have you never heard of abstractions used in science
  thats why psychology isnt science    an earthquake is not an abstraction  dna is not an abstraction
  fuck off faggot
  what mental disorder do you have
  you think only psychology uses abstractions
  not especially more than the average population i know mentally ill people around me and none of them are psy students most people have some mental illness of some sort the more dangerous ones are those who think theyre fine mental health is much like physical health few people are fully fine
  okay what fascinates you most in psychology how will psychology allow you to help people better than a person who doesnt understand psychology    honestly sometimes i feel like therapy is a scam they charge a ton of money just to talk to you like a normal person could most mentally ill people benefit far more from medications designed by real scientists how is some therapist going to help them by charging 200 an hour with weird conversations and exposure therapy
most psychology majors ive met are idiots or mediocre psychology does not seek to be objective and should be burned down and started anew  youre best all argue with eachother mainstream psychology is a sham funded by jews
  its very tricky but many therapists dont rely heavily on diagnoses and prefer to focus on the person in their specificities and idiosyncrasies that is how i will proceed as a therapist also why i will likely choose the personcentered training    you dont need an exact diagnosis if you know how to help your patient
    science uses abstract terms but they arent their object of study  in psychiatry study how the brain acts when someone is happy or crazy  in psychology study the how the emotions act when someone is happy or crazy  in psychiatry they use medicine to cure  in psychology the use words to cure    psychologicians know something about the brain but it is not their ultimate focus      this is boring and circular bye
  it seems you dont even know what psychology is
  in psychology the use words to cure  wololoo
  are you a medfag psychiatry is more pseudoscience than psychology
  holy fuck that magic word did it im no longer suffering from gender dysphoria write this up and submit it to all the top psych journals plz
  lol  you have no idea what you talk about  but it it still good laugh
  lucky all it did for me was change the color of my shirt
  not a pseudoscience    i needed that good laugh in my day thanks
  psychology can show solid evidence of what it suggests    lel

my visual hallucinations arent lasting long anymore 12 seconds should i go back to the doctor
  why would i want to
  arent you the messiah of the rodents
  you should know because you just did
  are you too stupid to study a real science dont answer its a rhetorical question
  my iq is 142 so i dont give a shit if my classmates are less intelligen than i am it only makes my choice a better choice as i will destroy the competition
    psy isnt a pseudo its just got exponentially more unfounded bullshit in it than other fields do     also  what do you plan to do once youve been given your useless piece of scrap paper of a diploma do your parents have enough money to fund you going to grad school
  i want to become a therapist and i am having a difficult time deciding which path i want to take currently im planning on becoming an lpc but honestly im not sure i can get my masters for 20k and im getting my bach for free if my savings and scholarships dont decrease in value basically i want to help people while also maintaining fiscal responsibility i dont want to be a millionaire but for more work i feel like i should have a career which will maintain me for quite some time currently i am a freshman in college although including all my ap and community college credits i should really be sophomore but thats neither here nor there again i do want to help people more than anything theres also the issue that i being on 4chan am not the most mentally healthy person myself im not dahmer or anything but itll likely be an issue
  that actually sounds like a viable strategy i once wondered what it would be like to go and study psychology with an extensive mathematical background id have a niche that hardly any of the other students could compete with me for
  what is it like being surrounded by 114 iq peers do you ever wonder if the things in your textbooks have actual physiological correlates proven by neurbiological and genetics studies what level of mathematics did you/have you attained to lotta pussy to go around amirite chad
  do you think soul exist and what is consciousness
psychology is a legit field but the main problem is that psychologists have never been fully equipped to solve their own problems they havent scratched the surface at all most psychologists dont even know and dont care how computer works and yet they think they can crack the most complicated machine that has ever been designed
what jobs are available for bc psychology student  also do you regret going for psychology degree instead of engineering field or anything related
  mmh ok heres my question what are you doing on /sci/ fucktard ya dont belong
  took 3 posts for the obligatory not science turbo autism post proud of you      same never was a jock but i was definitely far healthier than i am now and the female attention or lack thereof only confirms it its amazing how girls can weigh things simply through vision
  had you ever any mental illness  why are you want to be psychology
  are you taking it because you couldnt comprehend any of the hard sciences
  how much psychoanalysis are u guys taught psychfags from where im at basically dont get taught it except in passing for historical context also why do nonenglish speaking europshycfags specially france still use it
  no one designed the brain faggot
  because it was pretty obvious from the start that anglo psych aimed for the appearance of rigour while yuropoors eschewed strictness for a more comprehensive approach anglos ended up being perpetually wrong because theyre oversimplifying brainlets and now modern neuroscience is discovering that freud was basically right

op im not sure this will help but its what i have to offer    i have similar issue with my work because its basically my dream job scientist on a space mission theres always a little bit of grinding every week but lots of satisfaction as well    the problem is that its hard to have any hobby projects that dont use the same mental resources as my day job and burn me out the only way ive managed is to clearly delineate office time and home time even going so far as to consciously stop myself from thinking about a work problem at home if i know im not going to be able to resolve it then and there make sure you have some down time separating working on your day job and doing your side project physical/temporal separation will help with mental separation    also try to focus on different aspects of your day job and side project for example if youve been doing a lot of database work at the office try to put in some time on your side project wrt algorithm development    good luck

is smoking actually bad for you /sci/ give me some scientific evidence either way
  yes
is inhaling burning plant matter along with small amounts of ash really bad for me    go stand in the middle of one of the california forest fires and find out for me
  no it actually increases longevity and is being looked into as a cure for aging
why do you need scientific evidence its trivially unhealthy
  fucked up lungs are a pretty good if you want to die early
  it causes heart disease and lung cancer what else do you want
  no its good it prevents the extremely painful and depressing condition called octogenarianhood
  dont worry guy who doesnt know how to search for scholarly articles i got you    resultsexcess mortality associated with  smoking was about twice as extreme during the  second half of the study as it had been during the  first half the death rate ratios during 197191  comparing continuing cigarette smokers with lifelong  nonsmokers were approximately threefold at  ages 4564 and twofold at ages 6584 the excess  mortality was chiefly from diseases that can be  caused by smoking positive associations with  smoking were confirmed for death from cancers  of the mouth oesophagus pharynx larynx lung  pancreas and bladder from chronic obstruictive  pulmonary disease and other respiratory diseases  from vascular diseases from peptic ulcer and  perhaps because of confounding by personality and  alcohol use from cirrhosis suicide and poisoning  a negative association was confirmed with death  from parkinsons disease those who stopped  smoking before middle age subsequently avoided  almost all ofthe excess risk that they would otherwise  have suffered but even those who stopped smoking  in middle age were subsequently at substantially less  risk than those who continued to smoke  conclusionresults from the first 20 years of this  study and ofother studies at that time substantially  underestimated the hazards of long term use of  tobacco it now seems that about half of all regular  cigarettte smokers will eventually be killed by their  habit
    blocks your path
  no at the very least its nowhere as bad as it is made out to be  read whitby mds books and think for yourself an intelligent man examines an argument even if he disagrees with it      the smoking scare debunked      smoking is good for you        simpleton logic and straw man    this    smoke  bad  npc spotted    smoking will not lead to fucked up lungs    it doesnt cause either of those its statistically associated with them at only slightly higher rates than the general population and this is no surprise whenever the participants selfselect and the researchers already set out with biased hypotheses and are looking to prove themselves right also the us studies showing this statistical relationship failed to correct for dietary and lifestyle factors and grouped smokers a population in the us who is not the least bit health conscious as a lump because the researchers wanted to make smoking out to be the bad guy from the start the studies out of japan of the 1990s and 2000s stand in direct contradiction to the adverse cardiovascular effects and also show much lower rates of lung cancer now referred to as the smokers paradox coincidentally those japanese studies were not funded by the american lung association    associations   reader is too stupid to dissect the methodology used to derive these and accepts their validity without question
  yeah not with 100 accuracy but there are plenty of other options for folks with genetic resistance
  posts a 4chan screencap as evidence  posts links that refer to 2 books not published research written by some nobody with no scientific references    i can get decades worth of research that says cigarettes cause cancer but if you really think they dont go smoke another pack for me
  it doesnt cause either of those its statistically associated with them at only slightly higher rates than the general population and this is no surprise whenever the participants selfselect and the researchers already set out with biased hypotheses and are looking to prove themselves right  what an astounding level of delusion    2040x higher rate is not slightly higher and participants in large cohort studies arent selfselected did you form this opinion just to be a contrarian or are you a smoker desperate to rationalize your habit
  its statistically associated  one of the pdfs he linked to talks about how statistics are meaningless and faulty you cant reason with this level of retard
  yyeah not with 100 accuracy   itits genetic resistance   how peculiar that the documented oldest people who ever lived some 75 of them were tobacco smokers for something that was cited earlier as killing 50 of all its users then why on earth would 75 of the most extreme aged population be smokers it makes little sense even if they had some genetic resistance then why wouldnt we see more nonsmokers among the ranks at the very least    if you study the pharmacological properties of tobacco smoke you can see actions associated with it that would increase longevity kloto expression upregulation igf1 decreases etc      i can get decades worth of research that says cigarettes cause cancer  all epidemiological studies with flawed methodology with nonrandomized sampling from an ever increasingly nonhealth conscious population many health conscious people bought into the lie acting on this information stopped smoking and most health conscious people never pick it up because smokebad is so drilled into most peoples heads    ill make up things about the study design because the abstract doesnt say it  here is this absurdly high figure from the prestigious turkish journal of tuberk toraks which i take at face value   there is no selection bias in retrospective cohort studies guise  what an astounding levels of scientific illiteracy and stupidity
  ill admit it that abstract was just the first result i found on google because after looking through the studies a few years ago when i decided to quit smoking the evidence was so rocksolid i cant be bothered to look into it again    id be genuinely interested to hear how you came to have this opinion though what causes cranks
  the documented oldest people who ever lived some 75 of them were tobacco smokers  baby you know how i love a good citation serve it up  the studies out of japan of the 1990s and 2000s stand in direct contradiction to the adverse cardiovascular effects  oh god im so fucking hard over those citations i know you have at the ready to provide creedence to those wild claims
  is inhaling particuate matter actually bad for you  what do you think genius
  probably coulda made it to two hundred if she quit smoking     im just kidding smoke them if you got them
  
  i had to see a cardiologist once we talked about many things including smoking and said this to me we have no scientific evidence that smoking causes cancer because we have never conducted a study in which we forced people to smoke in a controlled environment and compared them against those who dont smoke who were also in an controlled environment    his point was that theres a big difference between what we know to be true and what is scientifically provable as true nevertheless smoking is bad for you anon and you should try to quit
its probably not good for you but also likely not nearly as bad as you have been led to believe
  no its healthy  just wait for a couple of years doctors will prescribe cigarettes
  go look for pictures of biopsies of smoker lungs they look worse than lungs of people who worked in coal mines for decades
nah just smoke 1 a day and youre good
      only about 4 posts to get an expert contrarian to defy scientific consensus how this place manages to get all these lowbrow geniuses is really a feat congrats op enjoy your healthboosting cancer
  my grandad worked in a coal mine for long times an smoked since he was 10 he lived til he was 85 he could have been a bit less crispy tho just look at smokers sputtering their way down the street  im an exsmoker feel much better the easiest way to top is to say you moke 10 a day smoke 10 a day for a period then 9 a day and so on much easier that way cold turkey is not easy lolz can breathe better oxygen  good for you  also your blood is produced in your lungs  blood  good for intelligence and many other things
  
  any smoking is harmful to your lungs over time as smoke in your lungs cools off it condenses bit by bit until you get that tar they always warn you about as a kid this process takes a very long time and can be reduced by allowing the cells within your lungs to eventually die and reproduce anew which takes a long time of not smoking this is also one of the factors at play that causes the famed smokers cough tar or resin lined airways which irritate the throat and trachea
  the existence of the japanese paradox is well known and even admitted by antitobacco research in the west  both of these studies show that smoking is not a statistically significant risk factor in stroke  1 toshima h koga y menotti a keys a blackburn h jacobs dr and seccareccia f the seven countries study in japan twentyfiveyear experience in cardiovascular and allcauses deaths jpn heart j 1995 36179189  2 kiyohara y ueda k and fujishima m smoking and cardiovascular disease in the general population in japan j hypertens suppl 1990 8s915    further studies discussing the japanese smokers paradox both cardiovascular and lung          find a list of the oldest verified people youll find 75 of them smoked well into their 90s and beyond
  i have actually in real life seen a biopsy and the specimen thus produced go fuck yourself with these blatant lies
  lower rates though still high because japanese cigarettes are of higher quality better filter less extras in there most us citizens live unhealthy other risk factors are lower in japan
  and ive seen biopsies of nonsmokers who thus produced likewise terrible samples furthermore imbecile the health of the population of smokers in the past two decades is abysmal so youre drawing from the worst of the worst they actually think smoking is bad for them yet do it anyways and have not one shred of concern for their health they eat shit live like shit this does not mean smoking is to blame for that test result
what are some other tobacco harm skeptic resources
bump
bumping because im interested
depends on the person
  honestly read the whitby books at the very least they should make you think
a review of chronic inhalation studies with mainstream cigarette smoke in rats and mice  no statistically significant increase in the incidence of malignant lung tumors was seen in either species as a result of smoke exposure a finding that does not agree with the results of epidemiological studies in humans possible reasons for this lack of correlation are given          are lung cancers triggered by stopping smoking  
  you guys should uh kill yourselves
  most people i know that smoke have chronical coughing problems and generally shitty health    ergo based in empirical data its bad for your health
  what is ecological fallacy
  when you smoke you are stained with the stench of an ashtray    that alone should be enough everytime i go to a bar or pool hall i have to sanitize all my clothes
  nice argument    confirmation bias ergo based in empirical data its bad for your health    women find the smell of smoke appealing which is why perfumers utilize tobacco scents in expensive cologne like tom ford
  
  well small particles might enter your bloodstream over your lungs your body is not intended to permanently protect your lungs from this you know in nature this hardly happens only if theres a bushfire    its like you forgot where you body comes from go out in nature a bit more op    i smoke weed but at least i know its bad for me
  
  i get the feeling youre a /pol/ack based on your posts throughout this thread
  dont go back to him sounds like a fucking moron
  he said nothing that was factually incorrect you just have an npc like reaction to controversial information that you cant reconcile how does it feel to be a brainlet
  smoking causing cancer is a myth is the stoner equivalent of being a flatearther they all say this shit what a retarded group of people
  straw man  is the stoner equivalent of being a flatearther  i do not smoke cannabis or subscribe to flat earther beliefs  they all say this shit   the other groups mentioned allege conspiracy im doing nothing of the sort im presenting studies and evidence that contradicts the soft epidemiological that most think prove smoking causes cancer you just cant handle it and are utterly befuddled error does not compute
  the problem is that although you deal in facts and do not mention the conspiracy it exists and your ideas are harmful towards it therefore shills name calling ad hom attacks
  obviously there will be some noticeable effects if you smoke a pack a day
its been corrupted with chemicals homegrown tobacco is extremely illegal
    watch out we got a smokefag here
  noticeably good effects tobacco is a mental elixir and enhances the mind
  im not sure if this thread is retarded or based though isnt smoking is good for you literally a meme theory off /x/
  i assume they stole it off me i saw some imbecile in a pipe thread one time bastardizing the case behind some of the information i was once provided perhaps it was him
  why would i care what women like    smoking smells horrible and it literally stains everything including your teeth clothes furniture and walls
  smoking smells horrible  to you  literally stains everything including your teeth  nowhere near as much as coffee and especially black tea  clothes  not if you wash them  furniture and walls  i dont smoke indoors
  once you quit smoking and your sense of smell comes back you will be horrified of what smokers smell like
  it gave me emphysema
  i have a perfect sense of smell in fact since i took up smoking my sense of smell has only improved   smokers as a generalized group do have a terrible stench because the the average smoker in 2018 is scum who takes little care of his or her personal hygiene they smoke cheap mass produced sheet tobacco which is the smell that you recall probably stuck to some couch or cloth interior of a car smoking premium ryo tobacco or even say a high quality unfiltered cigarette such as an american lucky strike the smell is different and very appealing much like pipe tobacco
ive been put on the patch for about a month now i was a pack a day smoker at 20yo then became a chronic vaper ever since i quit i have more energy can breath better  smell better and barely cough     went for tests after some health complications had trouble breathing developed a chronic cough would notice that i would begin to yawn every time i entered a crowded room or places with low o2 like the metro radiography was fine they found some scarring in my lungs cause of it but its relatively benign urine was fine now i have to go back for a follow up on my blood test and im low key worried because they sent the other two by email so im pretty sure somethings wrong with me     and the worst was my addiction when i was a pack a day smoker at least i knew how much i was smoking but when i started vaping every other breath was a hit i would wake up and spend two hours just vaping before my mind was straight     ive tried weed opiates cocaine amphetamine benzos mdma lsd mushrooms salvia ketamine dmx mescaline ghb the only thing ive ever been addicted to was nicotine     i use to think that i enjoyed the act of smoking but in all actuality i just enjoy the induced dopamine rush you realize that when you stop smoking     worst thing is that it took me thinking i was dying before i quit even though i was studying how it worked as a biochemistry undergrad how it was carcinogenic and how it got incorporated into your dna what it takes for you to develop cancer how it was ciliatoxic and this only amplified its carcinogenic effect how it causes cardiovascular disease by damaging your arteries causing atheroma how it can lead to bronchitis how it can lead to emphysema how your dopamine pathway adapts in response to it     smoking is a trap get out while you can you are playing russian roulette
  do you have any studies on smoking and its effects on things like lung function and asthma/bronchitis     likewise is there a reason why tobacco needs to be smoked to get the good effects could it be delivered via pills/food
   the trips in the timestamp on top of satanic quads
  youre retarded all positive gain you get from smoking is quickly lost because of its acute effect on tolerance also its effects dont last long enough for it to be useful if you smoke long enough you need it to feel normal you cant focus unless you smoke       gum  patches exist   when you smoke it it goes directly into your bloodstream so its effects are amplified because of increased bioavailability and avoiding first pass metabolism
  she only died at 122 because the doctors made her stop eating those things at 119
  thanks anon
  no its been there for awhile like a few years i guess its more than just some silly meme after all
  anecdotal experience want mine i picked up smoking sometime in my mid 20s and i do not regret it at all it has improved rheumatoid arthritis almost totally improve my rhetorical skills and made me more reflective  i never derived much pleasure from it ive quit for weeks at a time and generally smoke 8 unfiltered cigarettes a day the enjoyment i derive is the break and the quiet moment of contemplation not some fiendish dopamine rush compelling me in fact ive been out of tobacco for several days yet feel no compulsion to obtain any it feels therapeutic remedies basic ailments sparks creativity the only thing i regret is refusing to smoke in all of the years leading up to that  what it takes for you to develop cancer   there is no consensus on the mechanism which is always viewed with a tunnel vision ignoring the fact that tobacco smoke as a whole fails to exhibit carcinogenicity in any experimental studies conducted on healthy models to date the best researchers attribute it to benzopyrenes they neglect to mention that these are found in far greater quantities of charred foods and actually are worse undergoing hepatic processing moreover there are constituents within tobacco smoke that bestow anticarcinogenic actions eg igf1 suppression which as a whole serve to attenuate the insults inflicted by other components  incorporated into your dna  tobacco is shown to increase telomere length relative to control there may be some hormetic mechanism much like ultra low dose radiation shows paradoxical effects on carcinogenesis  how it was ciliatoxic   debatable rats and dogs models were forced to inhale tobacco smoke with surgically implanted devices delivering very hot smoke which is going cause ciliatoxic injury in fact the constituents of tar are ciliaprotective eg polyphehols and coenzyme q10 and the acute effect injury actually leads to permanently increase glutathione production in surrounding tissue
  there is always a marginal benefit to be derived long after tolerance is incurred not as significant but its still there much like coffee drinking
  do you have any studies on smoking and its effects on things like lung function and asthma/bronchitis  this is the result of cigarette filters which deposit strands of cellulose acetate fibers deep into the lungs and further aerosolize the smoke making it be drawn into the innermost pulmonary recesses    cigarette filter ventilation and its relationship to increasing rates of lung adenocarcinoma       cigarettes with defective filters marketed for 40 years what philip morris never told smokers      likewise is there a reason why tobacco needs to be smoked to get the good effects could it be delivered via pills/food  there is no other substance that i am aware of with such a widespanning range of pharmacological effects go ahead and look around you for something that has this many medicinal benefits  you will find nothing coming close even coffee which i also enjoy does not come close with regards to the hormonal effects maob inhibition tobacco smoke is more potent inhibitor the reduction of igf1 upregulation of the various longevityantioxidants the best cocktail to recreate it would be a combination of selegiline nicotine glutathioneincreasing supplements perhaps curcumin and coenzyme q10 but that would fall far short of covering all the bases that tobacco would and the bioavailability of oral administration for many of these is poor however its infinity better than doing nothing
  youre fucking retarded    on carcinogenic effects          list of carcinogens in tobacco      on ciliatoxicity       on telomere maintenance in cancers    
  totally ignores the case within my post and deflects with studies that are irrelevant or do not contradict my case  i never said carcinogens were absent from tobacco and discussed and brought up benzopyrene carcinogenisis in the very post read it again and entertain even for a moment the arguments within it  on carcinogenic effects  list of carcinogens in tobacco  quantitative boogeyman most of the carcinogens are found in trace amounts and are found in other things humans consume repeating myself the only plausible ones to be concerned with are the benzopyrenes  despite there being the presence of these carcinogens in tobacco smoke tobacco smoke to date has never induced cancer in healthy subjects animals in experimental studies this indicates there are other constituents within the smoke that offset the damage  on ciliatoxicity  i said debatable as for these studies the first is in vitro conducted on dead tissue with hot smoke blown directly on it it cant utilize any of the pulmonoprotective compounds its unrealistic and completely abstract     as for study 2  in 28 endobronchial biopsies healthy smoker cilia length was reduced by 15 compared to nonsmokers p005 in 39 airdried samples of airway epithelial cells smoker cilia length was reduced by 13 compared to nonsmokers p00001 analysis of the length of individual detached cilia in 27 samples showed that smoker cilia length was reduced by 9 compared to nonsmokers p005 finally in 16 fully hydrated unfixed samples smoker cilia length was reduced 7 compared to nonsmokers p005     those decreases are not drastic i do not see any variables adjusting for income workplace occupation income diet or lifestyle factors smokers especially by 2009 were nonhealth conscious and usually lower class my case still stands
  on telomere maintenance in cancers  if aberrant telomerase expression was induced by tobacco that contributed to cancer then why do the hard studies experimental animals fail to demonstrate carcinogenesis
  fpbp
  there is no evidence provided so its actually the worst post in the entire thread
yawn another schizoid infested thread
  thanks anon
  you are most welcome
  smoke cigs for weeks on end  vo2 max plummets  get more respiratory infections than any point in my life  heart rate is spiking uncomfortably  smell bad clothes smell  lose taste  stop  everything resets and feel infinitely better  same results in everyone ive ever seen smoke  duller than before and need more caffeine for sure but can run and workout more easily  erections are stronger too  lol whatever man
when did consciousness appear in humans  is it something as old as modern man or even present in older homos or is it something produced by the sophistication in civilization  is consciousness meat as in in the brain chemicals folds etc or is it culture as in created by human interaction and not physical    consciousness in general keep it more or less scientific no faith/myth stuff
  if you insist on making another stupid consciousness thread let me point out that this is not science  consciousness has no scientifically accepted definition  and should go to     anyhow humans arent special whats to say that dolphins or elephants or crows or gorillas arent perfectly conscious
  im guessing its the meat i was reading earlier that even chimps display a range of emotions and mirror awareness so step one is being able to process the world beyond im hungry or should i trust this thing    and im guessing drugs helped to expand our consciousness
what does /sci/ think of quantum immortality can our consciousness shift between everett branches      
  the fact that this timeline is the one where youre not dead yet is trivial as fuck only complete brainlets find this hypothesis compelling
  quantum suicide is dumb and no nothing can hop between branches in the many worlds interpretation they are decohered    in terms of quantum suicide it basically boils down to the fact that branching occurs when the quantum event happens and decoherence occurs when the superposed state interacts with the environment/the measuring instrument the processes do not depend on observers
  its apparently not present in the homo that is op
  they are decohered  hello where are the proofs
is there a field where you just study proofs
is there a field where you just study proofs  mathematics
  proof theory is a subset of logic so you may want to look there basically one studies how arguments can be formalized from axioms and rules of inference its pretty interesting  but if you mean more like is there math where you only do lots of proofs then youre in luck thats all of math
  this 
  formal verification methods or some other such branch of computer science
    no shit retards im asking about fields of math where proofs are the object of study
  then proof theory like this anon said  
    or like i said
  analytic philosophy
  try spectral sequences
  is there a field where you just study poofs
  prove it
  why would you ever want tto subject yourself to do dull boring subject
  yep its pretty dull why people dont try inventing more maths instead of proving stuff s  i want to see tetrahedral ipsimorphic functors and fractalbased theories of hat circularities that are metarecursive in a beingaesthetics kind of way with flying spiral chains on giant padic monkeys inventing maths is better than proving
  engineering
  what youre saying makes absolutely no sense because mathematics is discovered not invented
  people answer his question truly he refuses to believe the world of maths is actually this beautiful  bro i have the best news ever  also proof theory is the farthest you can get from seeing actual proofs might as well study fucking philosophy or something    queer studies
any fellow deep learning researchers here 
  not /sci/
  i play around with the tools have a project similar to gan where ill do a website where each client who visits play a game of snake between two ai networks and for each completed game the site will report the winner of the two network iterations to the server and thus evolving the network for the next visitor the idea is to make a sort of data distributed network in javascript all made in simple html5 originally i thought about making the clients mine bitcoin for me but that would be sort of illegal or at least unethical so i didnt go through with it and redesigned it around ai instead     pic is a random face generator which i played around with to create small clips

i had a project last year where i had a cnn looking for cosmic strings in simulated cmb patches was good fun  im thinking of getting back into it to try some neural net stuff i can sell to the bigshot youtubers my sister knows for some     heres a string causing some anisotropies
  that looks an awful lot like algebraic graph theory to me
  currently a second year phd student in machine learning
anyone have decent material for learning how neural networks actually work seems like everyone is hyped on them but nobody actually understands them

  deep learning researcher  is this even a real career  tweak learning rate and layer parameters  publish paper  rinse and repeat
  3b1b on youtube the internet
    what this guys said 3b1b has a series that explains the basics really well
is it possible to know why reality exists
is it possible to know why reality exists  what have you tried
  not via science nor mathematics     only aesthetically can you answer that
  im not sure if this is true it seems plausible that a new discovery could neatly explain why our universe exists it could be that non existence is impossible for some reason right
  but once we know the reason why nonexistence is impossible well need to know the reason why that reason exists and so on to infinity
toxic people restate themselves and are needlessly verbose when making a point
  well obviously its very simple actually just take nothingness to a logical extreme you get the canvas of the painter the rock of the sculptor the pages of a writer the universe is just that pure freedom everything happens at least once same goes for nothing and all the varients whether possible or impossible all worlds exist somehow because the universe is undefined it has no constraints in other words there is no god there is no law there is nothing beyond and thats exactly the point its pure raw creativity raw information raw possibilities and the reason we live this world is just an anthropocentric bias not all universes lead to consciousness
  as the other anon pointed out the die are already loaded as soon as you ask the question the words universe is already fundamentally abstracted to mean everything words are just metaphors that dont have a necessary and logical relationship with what the propurt to be as such an elegant solution as to why everything exists dosent contain any end in itself it only contains more questions and abstractions to be explored
  still begs the question of why thats possible though i just want a neat explanation i can use to seem cool to my pseud friends 
  the nameless nonbeing is the origin of universe    the named being is the mother of all observed things    within nonbeing we enjoy the mystery of the universe    among being we observe the richness of the world    nonbeing and being are two aspects of the same mystery    from nonbeing to being and from being to nonbeing is the gateway to all understanding     hegel
  a realm of zero constraint and infinite possibility where neither boundary nor content exists   chris langan
  unbound telesis is the absence of information  the absence of any information and order but only potential thereof    in the ctmu ubt unbound telesis is the groundstate of existence arrived at by stripping away the constraints of reality since there are no distributed constraints to limit its content ubt is allinclusive infinite potential and the source of all freedom    reality is created by filtratively emerging from this potential by the process of telic recursion since reality has a selfdefined informational boundary distinguishing it from its complement unactualized potential or unreality it has recognizable content and structure
  sometimes restating a point is required in order to get brainlets to understand it there are numerous times when i have to dumb down things because people are fucking stupid i m sure if i was talking to a fields medal recipiant they would have to dumb things down so that i wouldnt have to take ages to understand what they say
  why does it make sense to ask why reality exists   you apply the question of why when there was someone who made in the first place as when there is a motivation behind the action but if no one makes reality then whats the point of asking the purpose    not all questions are valid lets think of a metasocratic method rather than a naive socratic method
  how is being happy  toxic while being pathetic and useless is ok  the toxic here is obviously the second one since this kind of world view is pitiful and destructive
  absolutely in fact its very simple solution reality exists for the simple reason that nothingness is impossible just read this and youll understand  
  imagine youre digging yourself into a hole and a friend comes and commemorates your progress encouraging you to continue is he a toxic person
  is he a toxic person  yes since he appreciates your degenerate behavior encouraging you to continue
  i think therefore i am  that answer your question op
  try and think of it as a nonthinking emotionless and yet chaotic yet extremely orderly mess of causality that is all bundled up in the one place and that place stretches billions of kilometres in every direction something that massive doesnt allow nevermind need justification for why it exists
  whenever i skip to the point people dont get it unfortunately people are stupid to the point where you have to be excessively verbose so you dont get retarded criticisms and questions that waste 10x more time than just being verbose
  nah bruh   you would just need a recursion within that reason
  computer scientist vs computer engineer  poo in loo vs white guy  seems fitting
it always amazes me how people major in something they can literally learn for free in a few months
  cs  not science or math
  untrue though its actually the opposite      meaningless since this is only contingent to what higher institutions offer there exist other ways to make a syllabus moreover the brightest of all scientists are the phd computer scientists even if the bachelor computer scientists arent as bright as the ones with a bachelor of some physical science
  the brightest of all scientists are the phd computer scientists    hahahahahahahahaha no
  what do v s and m stand for
  math/cs    math phd  physics phd  engineering phd  cs phd
mfw reading this thread while in a cs class
he chose his major based on anime imageboard street cred  jokes on me now i install thermostats for a living with ny stem degree
  tfw majored in ee beacuse sci told me cs was for brainlers
    code monkey certifications are not cs
  code monkeys are not cs      you need a cs degree to be a code monkey    make up your mind 
if it wasnt for the job market being overrun by pajeets on h1bs id think cs was a decent career
  cs major here can confirm these are true strongly considering changing to ece after finding out 99 people here work in code monkey jobs
  is civil engineering any okay  im still applying to colleges im 18 dont worry mods
  bumb
  cs and codemonkeying are two different things its true that a lot of people go to cs to codemonkey that being said cs research groups at universities are legit theres a disconnect between what cs is and whats easy for undergrads to make fun of hence the blue man cs meme its pretty funny to watch too since there are currently 34 threads devoted to cs despite how maligned it is never forget that the majority of people here are engineering undergraduates many of which well known for their need to constantly validate their academic abilities
  it was so simple at my uni computer science the science of what can be computed etc was called bachelor of cs software engineering with the project management system design etc was called bachelor of se and what you all call cs coding was bachelor of it
  very small men

  verbal spatial mathematical i dont know guessing
  9gag  okay op whatever you say
  not even wrong
  wat do u do tho    u should learn allen bradley / ladder logic and get into industrial or oilfield automation and make like 150k a year    lot of ees doing that
  150k for ladder logic  are you serious
  its literally in the name
  its true any ee/cpe can learn all the cs fundamentals in a few months
  
  source please
  cs eternally btfo holy shit
  fell for ee meme  left my 3rd world shithole and now working in the sc field    thank you based anons
  wat do u do tho  asic design i dont actually regret having done ee over cs desu
  civil engineering is the art of engineering
  ece does not do vector calculus and odes in first year fuckstump
  verbal spatial and mathematical
  the problem here is that you have a lot of engineering students who view their education as a skill set to build things they generalize cs to be a set of problems to solve general code skills and then thats it thats why theres this whole sentiment that an engineering student can do cs what  said is correct in reality industry basics to write someones shitty server policy isnt doing cs this is doing cs  
  being the meme  i didnt say they could learn general code skills in a few months i said they could learn actual cs discrete math data structures computer architecture algorithms automata theory computability and complexity operating systems in a few months any cpe/ee major that passed courses like signal analysis and electromagnetics will have an easy time learning any cs topic since these are far harder and more math intensive than anything cs has
  maybe if theyre living out in the middle of nowhere most people have ap calculus or cc credit
  these are far harder and more math intensive     lolwhat there needs to be a blue man meme for ee/cpe majors memorizing lookup tables for fourier transforms and a basic control theory class isnt more math intensive carrying out the integrals when you need to do so isnt intensive ee cs and math grad are all way different in grad than undergrad i know youll just use the blue cs man meme to deflect this all away but cs gets research funding and high profile conferences for a reason if it were just rudimentary logic nobody would actually care
  vector calculus in ee  taking the cross products and divergence isnt substantial vector calculus
  my papa is a civil engineering hes not a brainlet but neither a genius still not an average joe
mathematics requirements in computer science  while nearly all undergraduate programs in computer science include mathematics courses in their curricula the full set of such requirements varies broadly by institution due to a number of factors for example whether or not a cs program is housed in a school of engineering can directly influence the requirements for courses on calculus and/or differential equations even if such courses include far more material in these areas than is generally needed for most cs majors as a result cs2013 only specifies mathematical requirements that we believe are directly relevant for the large majority of all cs undergraduates for example elements of set theory logic and discrete probability among others these mathematics requirements are specified in the body of knowledge primarily in the discrete structures knowledge area    we recognize that general facility with mathematics is an important requirement for all cs students still cs2013 distinguishes between the foundational mathematics that are likely to impact many parts of computer scienceand are included in the cs2013 body of knowledgefrom those that while still important may be most directly relevant to specific areas within computing for example an understanding of linear algebra plays a critical role in some areas of computing such as graphics and the analysis of graph algorithms however linear algebra would not necessarily be a requirement for all areas of computing indeed many high quality cs programs do not have an explicit linear algebra requirement similarly while we do note a growing trend in the use of probability and statistics in computing and believe that this trend is likely to continue in the future we still believe it is not necessary for all cs programs to require a full course in probability theory for all majors      the most math intensive assured class in cs is precalculus
  ma i posted it again    and again    ha ha ha
  maybe in other states in california physics iii  cal iii are the bare minimum
  carrying out the integrals when you need to do so isnt intensive   thats still more math intensive than cs classes
  physics iii  physics is useless for cs tho
  nah not really at the immediate undergrad level cs requires calculus and logic but as you get to nontrivial problems ie the computational complexity of physical systems the physics and really calculus becomes relevant even in pursuit of software engineering knowing physics is important because of the various things youre going to be working on
  id say it depends on where you go notice how the less fancy mathematical machinery you have the more complicated reasoning out hard problems is engineering classes build up a lot of fancy mathematical tools to plug and chug answers to components in a system id argue that while the actual engineering is pretty tough the math is really straightforward because the work has been done in the form already that the mathematical machinery takes care of the hard part    this is in contrast to say basic analysis where most of your toolkit consists of inequalities arithmetic implications and the definitions/axioms id say most cs majors shy away from math though there were a lot of math/cs double majors at my school including myself which makes sense since its a research school where math and cs researchers share the same office but at the very least a good amount are exposed to mathematics as reasoning rather than mathematics as a tool i think engineering students rate difficulty and sophistication of the math based on the exotic ways to offload the reasoning into premade notation aka what i was saying before about how taking the integral isnt intensive is undergrad cs math easy if you take the bare minimum but at my school the upper level theory courses in complexity were super tough and of course populated by math majors and incredibly fun i do think its sad that most cs majors want to cash in on the software decelipmwnt route but honestly academic cs and the math of cs is just clean honest fun for the whole family
  development route   cursed phoneposting
  but at my school the upper level theory courses in complexity were super tough and of course populated by math majors and incredibly fun  were these just complexity zoo
  no the complexity zoo is like the introductory lectures actually analyzing problems is the hard part and that touches a lot of traditional mathematics continuous and otherwise
  yet almost everyone who do cs end up getting these certifications for code monkeying i dont even know what real cs is about but literally everyone i know who did cs are now code monkeys which is the thing that baffles me
  most of my peers ended up doing grad school real cs ends up being math problems i do see some researchers st google amazon and private labs
  this is so true that it fucking hurts
  the funny thing is that most people who trash cs do so because they just went to a shitty university essentially outing themselves as a brainlet    cs courses at top 10 schools are heavy on theory and math
  people only go to college for a piece of paper you can learn anything for free with a few months of hard work thats mostly what college is half the professors in the world are fucking horrible at their job
  what is a code monkey someone who develops software for a company why does it surprise you that most computer science degrees go towards professional software development do you think most of them end up in labs trying to figure out crazy algorithms for the good of man kind    what do computer engineer students even go into
  what do computer engineer students even go into  everyone i know who took cs is just doing consumer application software but i know ces working all over the place automotive healthcare and top tech firms working on fundamental improvements to internet infrastructure
  off the top of my head i know 3 software engineers two of them are college dropouts one of whom im pretty sure is a permanent neet now the other is my coworker who does the exact same shit i do which is propriety software for a printing company    motivated people get good jobs everyone else goes for whoever will pay them enough money to jerk off to anime porn in peace it has nothing to do with the degree they got
  you know i took cs and im now an nlp scholar
  cs courses at top 10 schools are heavy on theory and math    lies and slander its always those who dont realize their courses are trivial that are the brainlets
  cs courses at top 10 schools are heavy on theory and math    show me an american cs program that looks like this
  read concrete mathematics by knuth its the best math textbook ever because of the creativity required to solve each problem and its a book on discrete mathematics which is chiefly used by comptuer science
  programs like this are legitimately not uncommon i dont know about america though
  this is literally just some bullshit that an anon came up with there is way too broad a scope of knowledge here you would forget 90 of this shit by the end of your major and put all that effort in to still be a coding monkey
  not him but im a math grad the whole you can pick cs theory up in a few weeks is just /sci/ shitposting its an active field of research for a reason the thing is like  said a lot of problems have solutions that are contingent on finding the trick especially when writing nontrivial algorithms you dont need a lot of mathematical machinery to start talking about cs but it builds naturally as you start to get to more complicated problems its full of interesting problems to solve and it gets as applied or as pure as you want it to be
  you could do this if you self study like 2 of the courses each semester but dont kid yourself in thinking you could actually complete this and be an a student with research nobody has a curriculum like this much less engineering students you usually get bodied with general requirements scientific breadth in early years and then devote time to taking 4 max 5 really tough classes and doing research with a professor on the side at least thats how it was for me
  they could be covered superficially also studying on your own you could cover much more and in less time
  i wouldnt say superficially the shitpost comes from the fact that as classes get more difficult the schedule calls for 7 of them taking 6 upper level courses is not a fun time you could maybe do 5 freshman or sophomore classes albeit be pressed for time but 7 classes per semester in your last year on top of applying to grad school/jobs not happening
  and its a book on discrete mathematics which is chiefly used by comptuer science  hahahahahahahahahahahahaha
  the whole you can pick cs theory up in a few weeks is just /sci/ shitposting its an active field of research for a reason  you can at the undergrad level retard
  cs  not math  you say that because cs is a superset of maths

  thats not really a meaningful statement since undergrad cs is so inconsistent i agree that basic data structures and algorithms are easy but any further in algorithms travels into nontrivial and nonobvious territory     regardless i legitimately dont think you can pick it up and be good at it big oh isnt hard basic data structures isnt hard either seeing the trick to hard problems is hard 
  instead of posting these memes tell me whats wrong with what i say concrete mathematics by knuth is definitely a discrete maths book with a myriad of exercises that require a lot of creativity and imagination   one would profit more from reading polyas book how to solve it than vellemans how to prove it a lot like this distinction 
  regardless of the meme either cs is math or cs is a superset of math  make up your mind
  thinks knuth superficial treatment of number theory or combinatorics is impressive  thinks cs brainlets are the only ones that study these topics    lel
  chiefly is not the same as only ones  and its not the depth of superficiality of his treatment though i believe its rather a deep treatment but rather the problems in the book which are fascinating for whoever learns from that book instead of learning from another book
  lovasch  knuth is fine for an up and coming combinatorialist/fundamental algorithmicist what knuth is good for is building intuition on lots of problems lovasch teaches the theory amazingly well i mean naturally seeing as how he was up there with erdos
  also  not just reading hungarian math and cs papers  its like you hate fun
  you say that because cs is a superset of maths  its a supercategory not a superset
  math below engineering  i dont believe that for a second  t engineering student
  
  i dont believe self help blogs cool that this guy did it on an individual level but i dont believe this guy would be able to do research like i said the cs curriculum isnt hard at the bare minimum if you dive into it which is mostly a cs math double major and shy away from the non meme books as ive hinted in my other posts the curriculum gets immediately harder
  additionally this guy self evaluated everything he admitted himself that it was mostly for him but i dont think this was about actually getting into it as much as saying i did it and im not inclined to believe he got through all the material as stated in the video it was about passing the exam and doing the bare basics of the programming assignments i spent some time comparing my old undergrad work to his and his questions were a lot nicer than the ones i got basically i like any grad school would be skeptical to let this guy through whether the subject were computer science or physics
  who does cs research in their bsc you usually just do projects
  no what i mean is that theres some good fundamentals here and there but i dont think this guy is research ready the ideal way to do bsc in cs is to double major in math for a research career imo since cs research is leagues more interesting than codemonkeying
    ah my mistake i misread what you wrote but anyone can do research lul even a monkey could literally research is soo soooo easy and fun and the most hilarious part is that i am not being ironic
  doing good research is hard going about and doing research without any standards in mind is easy
  only the present moments exists and objects in your attention might reorient your mind towards other ideas and with practice the reorientations change to the extent that one could pay attention precisely to what is relevant and nothing else but at the end you are never outside the context never outside your cravings  you will always have your head over a single cell on the strip of the tape of the stream of the subjective life therefore having standards is a consequence of going about and doing research without standards
  no when i say standards i mean being able to chase down the solution to a nontrivial problem or generalize the problem into more theory that asks deeper questions those are hard things to do having standards is a consequence of being aware of your surrounding research culture you dont do it in isolation
   i mean being able to chase down the solution to a nontrivial problem  for that just be actively open minded keep searching dont just look where you feeel the answers are but look somewhere else  wander  generalize the problem into more theory that asks deeper questions  its not that difficult to discover that you can generalize problems into theory but even if you cant on your own the research community is not just in real life it also sleeps cozily among the various publications publications that demonstrate the use of those standards so sure if you want to go fast with your research you might best depend on the existing literature than to create something from scratch though it could be a useful exercise and yes all of this could lead to an adoption of research culture practices for in its foundation since all knowledge comes from experience one can only acquire things but through imitation or imitation of some aspect or distortion
  i have a phd in ece and i agree that its superior to cs but youre being a dumb faggot if you really think you can pick up actual cs that easily
who big 4 /swe/ here    facebook cheggin in
  actually lmao rn holy shit im a senior cpe major in the thick of my capstone project i saw a project about industrial machine design and it piqued my interest whats cooler than accelerating the unemployability of most of the population now here i am balls deep writing ladder logic routines for an international corporation i literally stumbled into this shit and youre telling me it could actually be a lucrative career path ive been told that there is a job offer at the end of the year if all goes well wtf
  cute my signing bonus at facebook was 100k
  have fun being a peon for the literal evil empire my ancestors are smiling at me imperial can you say the same
  kek i like it here though theres a lot of interesting ethical discussions we have internally no we dont record audio and shit and huge problems people here are insanely smart any problem that stumps me i can turn to the guy on my left and hell smoke it
  by huge problems i mean problems of operating at a bigass scale    google is another good spot for smart cs majors
  what is big 4 /swe/ 
  its a term coopted from finance tards for cs majors to circle jerk about ie the most prestigious companies to work for as a swesoftware engineer    amazon  microsoft  facebook  google
  aka engineer day cares
  do you get complimentary onions if you work there
  what the fuck  this shit is still going on  i got duped
      and the guy in  link managed to pick up cs  calculus and physics courses in a year an ee/cpe major already mastered the latter so learning the former will take just a few months
  what is your vector calculus if not green/stokes/divergence theorems
as a guy in my 20s went to college after working for few years i want to kill everyone saying how cs is easy    either you have incredibly bad and lazy course with some small assignments or you are lying i dont even know where to begin explaining the rape in our first semester however its supposedly being the hardest and to filter people out i thought listening to /g/ and /sci/ saying how compsci is a meme is true but its the opposite in our college either im doing assignments that take up couple of days in my free time or am studying and going to lectures i just want to breathe for a day yet you faggots think its a meme because your colleges have a retarded course for pajeets
  listening to anything on /g/ or /sci/
  plc programming is a fucking sweet job my friend and highly in demand/good pay
  i am so hard rn you have no idea this shit is like babbies first logic and theyre having trouble filling positions for this like wtf is this
  the possibility that he is a brainlet never even crosses his mind    i got terrible news for you
  is this just something how like there is an undergraduate degree in natural science bachelor of science that usually is not any kind of preparation to be an actual scientist its kind of just showing you some results from science so far
  the people in charge of nurturing future generations are the absolute bottom of the barrel
  yup  and theyre also the most entitled of all government employees with huge influence over cultural norms and development of the personality of our children
  personal grooming and hygiene seminar
  anon you can learn the entirety of human knowledge in front of your computer  no shit college is useless when you think of it that way but is anyone reading dovstyofski or reading on interconnect parallel system no
  i really wish the west would collapse already everything now is just prolonging the torture
  it looks like maths relatively low spatial score is what puts engineering/physical science ahead
  only the present moments exists  presentism needs to die in a fire
  civil  i hope you like architecture  has the most women of any engineering major  theres going to be a lot of moment equations
  you think there are other cultures that have babysitting kids as a high status activity that only the elite are selected for
  biology  thats not shit  comedy gold
  what is south korea
    homeschooling existed for a fucking reason  women were supposed to be teachers of their children not send them to be forcefed what nosewitz wants them to think for 7 hours by the state  properly teach your kid at home and witness them make the other kids look like gibbering apes by comparison
  it says chem or bio cant you read
  when you are at the top university of your country where admission is reserved to people who score in the top 1 and still claim its very difficult and/or time consuming you can rule out the brainlet hypothesis
math vs ee vs ece just looking for something challenging and useful
  ee  math is challenging but useless  ece has cs courses these are a joke
  matsci
  hahahahahahahahaha no  hahahahahahahahaha yes
  which country
  chile
  ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
  better than your shitty state funded local college 
i was going to do physics at university but i realised that physics would be a whole load of effort for a shitty job at the end of it so i dual majored in compsci  maths instead best decision of my life
  i would go personally to a state college being an american is worth way too much money for whatever reason an american citizenship is easily worth 100k500k
  yeah if woman were discriminated against we would have overqualified teachers
  damn i wish i had a coffve
  chile doesnt have cs programs tho
  i can tell that you are the insecure cs/math dual major that spams every cs thread
  what kind of retarded shit is this why would a course this intensive not expect you to have learnt calc 1 material in high school already what is up with americans and not learning calculus before university
was about to hit up cs for grad school about one year in i realized the math in cs is so watered down its comparable to a step above a humanities degree switched to physics in the next year never been more satisfied
  idk who youre talking about i was a math major who does math grad i just think its funny that engineering students think fourier transform lookup tables and the torrent of approximation methods that make the harder stuff disappear is math intensive
  as far as i know theory concentrations do the math youd expect but systems people often do not so the core requirements can be muddled with easy stuff 
  ive seen calculus applied to analysis of algorithms and machine learning what other areas in cs have you seen apply calc or use higher level maths minus category theory also generally speaking not very interested in proofs i know there are interesting ideas in applying graph theory to social networks but im not too interested in social either
  complexity theory samples mathematics from all sub fields the foundations start in logic but you have a lot of analysis theres even a subfield called computable analysis look up type two effectivity computational geometry and topology graphics which is all the former  differential geometry etc specialized topics include quantum complexity bioinformatics get into bioengineering if you want to do more physical systems learning over networks advanced algorithms i took a third semester grad algorithms class and it fucked me up all the problems are about finding some nontrivial trick compilers cryptography which also samples a lot of math look up ring learning with errors etc    if you dont like proofs why are you in math/cs/physics i guess in physics you can get around proofs with experiments but theory papers that make it to good conferences have people who dont shy away from proofs i might be biased since im in a mathematical physics group myself
  never needed to take a proofs course for my physics degree learned induction and it seems useful but ive never had to actually use it to solve problems or understand any of the great ideas in physics it is used in mathematical physics as you mentioned and all the people i know who work in the mphys group are mathematicians themselves so i understand what you mean however much id like to use them ive never needed to    ill look into some of what you mentioned but the general feeling i got from cs is that if i was interested in computation it makes more sense to specialize in math and sub specialize in algorithms than go full on cs could be wrong through    
  it really depends you can study anything using cs theory since its matured to where its being used in natural science induction is a basic proof strategy but you learn more as you go along and practice it comes down to understanding the basic structure of what youre working with and using its properties to derive your results for example in analysis the cantor set is a classic counterexample/test case for a lot of claims     from what i gather from the conferences ive attended theorists in math cs and physics are generally very similar types of people who write different motivations on their grant proposals
  addendum to the pathetically trivial list
  the difference is that as a math undergrad you have a lot of free time so classes like topology or differential geometry become incredible easy since you have a lot of time to study them
  speaking as someone from the industry no fucking way that said 70100k is not unreasonable depending upon the level of field work you want to do
  most cs kids lack the math knowledge required for these topics see 
  indeed many high quality cs programs do not have an explicit linear algebra requirement  high quality  wtf is wrong with burgers
  nah not really taking 45 math classes  research doesnt leave you with a lot of free time i do agree that engineering students have a lot of bullshit they have to wade through in the first two years of undergrad but i dont believe that a lab or two and a senior project especially so since i did a senior thesis is enough to water down the later half of the engineering core curriculum ive seen meches plug and chug odes and pdes into matlab and brag about their understanding of higher mathematics not to say that engineering is a bad or easy field but that engineering students dont have a magic pass when they are shitty students i think materials science and engineering people are consistently the nicest guys out of the bunch though
  as far as im aware most cs programs have linear algebra as a requirement as admission to the major have schools dropped this requirement you cant go far in even the most basic cs application/practicum and def not theory down the line without linear algebra
  to that id say get a masters or brace yourself for a hard transition into grad level work i think the few cs undergrads who choose to do grad while numerous in raw quantity are a minority among all cs undergrads realize how lacking their program may be or may not be if lucky and compensate accordingly your average cs undergrad probably sucks but whatever transition there is from undergrad to grad most cs grads seem to have their shit together in my experience i occasionally ta for grad special topics since im in mathematical physics that cs students take and people in the theory concentration have their shit down in math
  few cs undergrads who choose to do grad while numerous in raw quantity are a minority among all cs undergrads realize how lacking their program may be or may not be if lucky and compensate accordingly  in that case why would you do cs if youre going to need to compensate yourself your shitty program as someone else said doing math and specializing in algorithms sounds way better than having to self study the requirements for something like computational geometry let alone self studying comp geometry itself
  id imagine that it has to do with realizing they wanna do grad school for cs halfway through college but realizing that they want to take more math im pretty sure a good amount of then assuming their cs education doesnt already have a good amount of math anyway switch or double major if their school is not shitty and has enough math in the curriculum to make it easy i dont see outright bad students in grad anyway     i can ask students during office hours on monday place is pretty packed so im sure i can get a good number of answers
programming module  maths and data structures module  networking module  architecture module incl assembly and then machine coding apparently  throwaway ux/ui module that will then translate into using arduino and elaborating on webdev stuff from earlier this year  lowlevel communications module which is literally just signals modulation matlab and then goes onto image video / speech processing and cryptography/cryptoanalysis in the final semester    rate my first year cs lineup
  what the fuck is wrong with you people why would i learn fucking chemistry or biology in computer science/ee 
  yeah they should be learning how to make purdy websites with htmlcss to get dem jerbs
what about cse
  seething
  its what cs should be desu
  because a lot of nontrivial problems get solved there using basic computation basic industry work that isnt in the sciences is really boring
  i agree that cs should be standardized like engineering disciplines i think it should be heavier on math requirements so you dont get wildly inconsistent backgrounds
  where on earth do cs schools make you take ui its not even an option at my school
  i was just lumping it in because thats what the first semester is roughly about lots of ux and analysing uis creating them prototyping products and stuff its evidently a throwaway part of the module it was a minor that if you wanted to do lowlevel comms also a minor you had to do that aswell
  if you want to do a systems/low level concentration at my school you have to do architecture os design and implementation compilers  compiler theory and signal processing at the very least ui/ux isnt a systems cs topic its more hci
  some years i had to take 12 annual classes not american as an ee undergrad monsat from 800 to 1500 hs every day labs included for five years meanwhile my math major friends only had to take like 5 at most annual classes and had a lot of free time  ee is just a harder degree to get not only because of the coursework labs and shit but because you cover a lot of different topics that requires you to think very different some years i had to take classes like example em theory and applications thermodynamics statics electronic circuits modern physics economics some programing class real analysis and a couple classes related to law and labor standards yes these were boring as fuck a math degree is way more homogeneous and relaxed
first cs  programming or software engineering  second why are there still so many godawful shit programmers out there the industry is dying for talented programmers and they cant find enough if its so trivial teach yourself in a few months and go make six figures in any large city in the us enjoy a long and fulfilling career in software engineering
it seems like the people that think cs are a joke have only seen joke school cs programs cs theory is rigorous
  rreal communism just hasnt been tried yet
  5 annual classes in math ive never heard such a thing from my peers and i didnt have to do that for my degree i minored in physics the physics major version of em theory is really tough while the ee version goes into more information theoretic stuff for rf later    dude i dont know what you think math is all math past basics like vector calculus and odes is nothing but thinking very differently these people dont spend their time packing in dense amounts of information they work hard on actually solving fucking hard problems i did 910 annual classes and research on top of that if you think math is homogenous and relaxed then i dont know what your math program was like mine is within the top 15 doing ee work is tough if you do design as a major vs math youre in over your head if you think its a harder degree to get you wont know until you take a senior continuing topology class with a professor who has a hardon for weird surfaces in physics
  the way it works here is that 1st year you take major and minor  major is your subject with the bulk modules minor for me i could do it in cs or another subject  that module isnt intended to support the other one  we are doing architecture in a different module as i stated anyways operating systems and all the rest is next year with an actual hci module  i think after this year we dont really touch signals and such until my masters its an integrated masters course could be wrong though    uk by the way this is one of the top unis in the country so i was interested to get an overall rating on first year
  well i almost got a math degree as well didnt finish it because i got an internship to get a ee master in france    here is the ee program i did    yes you read it right it takes 6 six years to complete you can finish it in 5 if you take extra classes per year like i did  and this is the math degree   sorry couldnt find it translated
  lol this is literally just analysis and algebra and nothing else people shit on american programs all the time but there isnt even any pdes topology combinatorics etc the list goes on i think your schools math program is pretty lacking your ee program looks good though
    whoops there is a topology class but theres only one offered regardless this is really barebones
  you are cherry picking coursework from the worst cs programs and contrasting them with coursework from good ce programs
  chemistry is important to ece you retard
  thats every cs program in america though the only good cs programs here are either eecs or cse
    are you blind or stupid do you need me to translate it for you
    pdes topology combinatorics  all these are there i dont know what you are talking about
  political science is science
    please tell me this would actually work    the physicist in me says the logic is flawless
  why do social sciences and humanities have higher mathematical levels than verbal levels actually everyone seems so except the arts how can this be
  you should teach that physicist in you how to greentext properly
  ode and dynamical systems operating systems gpu programming and numerical analysis in one semester  id fucking crash and burn atleast if they teach them with the rigour and pace that they do at my school
  this is complete fantasy cooked up by some salty physics nerds that couldnt get a job out of school  all these schools give the same exact math and computing classes for all majors if you take calculus ii as a cs major its the same fuckin calculus ii as a math major or a physic major also you show me a school where the ee / ce students take compilers but not the cs students
hows  intro to oo and programming says intro on name description said to have experience  algorithms  systems programming   discrete math  for freshman cs courses
  i think it depends on the institution ive always known there to be parity for the most part between majors/specializations especially in the first couple of years of a degree but my experience has mostly been at top tier unis/colleges    i did meet a few people that are in software dev and took a computer engineering/science degree at lower tier places and their academic knowledge and portfolio reflected pretty poor knowledge focused on just making stuff with code which isnt great there is erosion of those sorts of qualifications in the workplace    the rough division between ce and cs if anyone is interested ce is similar to ee cs is more maths and even philosophy related as well as the older and more academic subject at a lot of institutions
  show me a school where the ee / ce students take compilers but not the cs students        kek
  take a look at the syllabus and see what textbooks or projects youre doing they just sound like early courses you might do in cs but what level theyre at and whether its right for you nobody here will know for sure    you seem to be a little wary of the oo course but a lot of people think they understand how to do oo when they clearly dont might be good especially if it gets you thinking about how to design code and software rationally
  wow i stand corrected even my shit state school taught the cs kids databases and compilers   what kind of joke is this
  im surprised at least ime most peeps even from cs or ce backgrounds know dick about compilers and i thought werent required to take a course in designing/optimizing one    not that other dude
  cs btfo
  im midoo course it feels like an extension of my postap cs track in highschool so it really hasnt introduced me to much of anything new but its good practice i think
  i am a professional programmer and i rarely use any of the math shit that i was forced to learn in college
  it was to teach you how to think
  theres a reason weve been saying this for literally years
muh compilers  i mean you guys realize that a vast majority of tech workers are webdev/database tards and have no need for any of this compiler bullshit its not 1994 anymore this is why china and russia rape most western countries when it comes to cs
  webdev and basic databases arent cs
  you gave an example of a bad curriculum cs and ce are two different things my dude people who are in cs either get into codemonkeying or if they do a good program get into grad school cs isnt the study of how to make a computer tick or even how to build one basically what  is saying cs unlike engineering isnt a set of skills you learn to get something made at non meme schools its just another academic study
  i am a professional programmer    so you are not a computer scientist
  if they do a good program get into grad school  there are no good cs programs
  eh the hard part about theory is originality coming up with a nontrivial algorithm on the spot is tough and proving it works can be an assload of work once you get past the basic trivial algorithms like comparison strassens etc its a fun topic especially in specific topics algorithms in signals was a personal favorite concentration bounds for randomized real time problems was a time sink
  pic related from the parallel algorithms textbook written by grama and gupta  in case 1 the sequence first monotonically increases then monotonically decreases  in case 2 the sequence decreases then increases  but because they describe 2 as an autistic cyclic shift theyre forced to provide an example so the reader can understand what the fuck they just said  why not just use plain english and the simplest possible description
  academics like to flex this is especially true in math and physics
  trying to get a serious answer from memelord /pol/acks larping as smart people  you are wasting your time m8 just saying
  implying math textbooks dont have a better sense of humor than any other field
  that doesnt contradict what i said
  because 1234 doesnt fit your definition but you can shift it to 2341 so it is bitonic
  
  goddamn are cs fags really this retarded  diffeq is probably the easiest math class any stem major can take
  not discreet math
  i found diffeq easier than discrete math
  be me    in mathematics department    suddenly this cs major ditzily waltzes around our campus lugging around his obviously inferior brain    mmuh forefront of technology he clumsily asserts as he tries to make friends    i gag a little    gathering the rest of my chad erudite department we corner him as he turns the hall pin him go the ground and take out protractors and measuring equipment    he starts panicking and blathering on about how cs is a super set of math    he cries out a little as we beginning measuring the circumference of his head and deriving 4th and even 5th dimensional manifolds from his inferior existence     establish with mathematical axioms that he is in fact a brainlet with a below average phenotype     take our time etching out a complicated thesis laughing as we peer review it on the spot noting exactly why he is the lowest iq in the group and laugh as we staple it to his back     begin paring our pencils over him     call him a beta iqlet and tie him to a statue of archimedes looking down on him dissapointedly a reminder of how much of a failure he truly is     snicker as we permanently marker his forehead with brainlet in a cursive function graph    as he lays there sobbing throw him a handkerchief with sigmaalphaphi written on it to remind him of mathematics true chad status     tell him to clean himself up    never hear or see another cs major again     mfw true chad mathematics wins again
  jesus christ
  im saving this if it werent for lereddit spacing
  this is why im never leaving my house again
  ii never asked for this  what the hell is wrong with you
          why why does this thread exist what the hell did we do to you to make us hate us so bad
      shh ssshhh   no tears only brutal now
  if somebody having less tendency to enjoy his job and doing it well thanks to your interaction you dont understand basic concepts and should kill yourself not much of a win scenario
  this is legit my nightmare 11/10
  laughing as we peer review it on the spot  kek
  lmao  phenotype      also hope this is a joke otherwise this is a literal super villain origin story
  mostly the smell
  mfw this entire post
  18 year old newfag here im going into college in one month january 7th and i want to be a cs major should i minor in math or is just cs enough will it improve my hireability to have a math major
  a good cs program should give you tough math courses to compliment it otherwise go out of you way to take them for your elective credit hours this likely makes it work having the minor    option b selfteach because youll have to do a lot of it in your cs courses anyway
  complement  before any turbonerds point it out
  a resume check will only really care if you have the major and a minor in math i personally felt naked without double majoring and taking as many hard classes from both majors as i could ended up getting into graduate mathematical analysis and graduate complexity theory by the time i was a senior but i went on to do grad school so its up to you i personally think that engineering majors do more than a cs or math major do individually especially if you skirt away from hard courses if mostly only in workload however i think double majoring in these or really any science  math and choosing to go ham in your course rigor/load  research matches if not surpasses an engineering workload its all up to how hard you want to go and personally i think its more meaningful to push myself to take the hard stuff because i wanted to rather than being forced to do so
  sigmaalphaphi  lol
  should i minor in math or is just cs enough  get a minor in math cs programs are well known for having piss easy math requirements another choice could be majoring in cpe and taking as many cs classes as you can
  computer scientist looks wise and respectable   lmao does anyone here know a cs major that isnt either a huge dork or utterly impassionate about their work
  hasnt cs been dead since the 80s seems like all the major algorithms have already been discovered that was one reason why i switched to chemistry
  no because nobody who isnt like that would ever associate with the kinds of fags that click on these threads
  unironically this
i was considering switching to ce but listening to people who actually majored in ce most just end up in software engineering jobs im interested in embedded software development but from the sounds of it most companies dont give a shit whether youre ce or cs and in some instances companies will go for cs majors over ce for higher level software engineering jobs i just cant rationalize the additional workload and studying facets of computing im not really passionate about
  all the major algorithms have been covered    lmao what now thats an uninformed statement just because basic sorting and string matching problems have been solved since the 70s doesnt mean algorithms are even closed to being solved thats like saying math is solved because we have analysis and algebra
  you are retarded the sequence given by them on that very page does not fit your definition 8 9 2 1 0 4
  what about majoring in math and selfteach cs a double degree in math/cs means an additional year of study wouldnt it be better to spend the time for a masters
mathematics and computer science are isomorphic under the curryhoward correspondence get the fuck over it  if your math or computer science degree isnt basically a double major in pure mathematics and computer science you are neither a mathematician or a computer scientist
  yeah thats a valid route if you want to do straight grad school it really depends on what you want to do i felt at home with theory but i wasnt sure if i wanted to work in parts of engineering research/rd down the line think control theory signals etc so i wanted to keep my options open double majoring let me stay close to theory gave me job options out of undergrad if i needed it and kept my foot in the door toward other routes really basic stuff like data structures is easy os design is hard because systems implementation/design is where nothing is abstracted and you have to make decisions on policy for busses ram etc that all have to play nicely with each other but its not too mathematically taxing classes like advanced algorithms one that comes after required courses are mathematically taxing since you have to come up with original and efficient solutions and the problems are finally nontrivial finding any solution can be a bitch proving it works can be tricky i would double major rather than doing a double degree since the two programs complement each other nicely     i should mentioned that i skipped through a bunch of physics classes to take some of the hard ones i chose to self study the rest and eventually i ended up in mathematical physics but my work is eligible for both theory cs conferences and math/physics conferences
  alternatively just do the double major yourself and de memeify your program
  everything is isomorphic to mathematics if you arent a brainlet
  no what curry howard shows is specifically that algorithms and proofs are isomorphic to each other the foundations of computer science are close to the foundations to mathematics and a lot of work in cs research has yielded results that are interesting in traditional mathematics departments
  spotted the brainlet
    change computer engineer to electrical engineer and it becomes accurate
  dont forget ccna lol
      reply in one post hot damn also what  is true flajolets work is one such example
    spotted the java developer
  mit cs  surface level  just stop
  fucking same here too
  thinks ethics is a waste of time  confirmed dunningkrugerlet
  i think he was claiming that the test materials the blog claimed to pass wasnt the same as actually doing the course ive done some ocw courses and it seems like some of the finals stress the last third of content more than the previous so you can just study the bare basics of the beginning focus on the last 45 lectures and then take the test if he actually did it mit cs isnt surface level but that doesnt mean this guys understanding is concrete since he basically hopped over a good amount of class material to his admission he said that this wasnt near any replacement to an actual undergrad program
  mbas have equal mathematical skill to math/cs undergrads but slightly less verbal and spatial  weeeeird
  why the fuck would a cs major need real analysis ii at my uni thats what they call the stupidhard measure theory course     actually why the fuck would they need analysis at all
first thread i see on /sci/  comp sci ms student  ookay
4 year cs degree from local university  graduate  land 75k starting entry level programming job in midwest  typical 95 not much stress  good benefits etc    feels goodjpeg    hows grad work going /sci/  still enjoying those ramens and shit living arrangements
  my uni is one bus away from my parents house so im flexing on all these pajeets living in hovels   looking forward to making fat stacks of dosh friend but its only my first year
  via 9gag  thinking you get to hate anything  kill yourself
  shows up in some fields of research while not immediately useful its invaluable when it comes to randomization/concentration bounds/complexity theory etc it depends on whether or not you want to go into industry or grad school industry cares about whats immediately applicable so purely discrete math is probably your best bet while analysis rears its head in any mathematical research field eventually so you ought to learn it plus on an academic note its a good thing to know lots of neat tricks on that note typetwo effectivity/computable analysis is an interesting body of work      what about a cs phd student its pretty stressful but i enjoy it i can avoid ramen by cooking on the dime never underestimate the amount of good hummus you can make with a dollar can of chick peas and ground cayenne pepper
 fixed   op  be me  in mathematics department  suddenly this cs major ditzily waltzes around our campus lugging around his obviously inferior brain  mmuh forefront of technology he clumsily asserts as he tries to make friends  i gag a little  gathering the rest of my chad erudite department we corner him as he turns the hall pin him go the ground and take out protractors and measuring equipment  he starts panicking and blathering on about how cs is a super set of math  he cries out a little as we beginning measuring the circumference of his head and deriving 4th and even 5th dimensional manifolds from his inferior existence   establish with mathematical axioms that he is in fact a brainlet with a below average phenotype   take our time etching out a complicated thesis laughing as we peer review it on the spot noting exactly why he is the lowest iq in the group and laugh as we staple it to his back   begin paring our pencils over him   call him a beta iqlet and tie him to a statue of archimedes looking down on him dissapointedly a reminder of how much of a failure he truly is   snicker as we permanently marker his forehead with brainlet in a cursive function graph  as he lays there sobbing throw him a handkerchief with sigmaalphaphi written on it to remind him of mathematics true chad status   tell him to clean himself up  never hear or see another cs major again   mfw true chad mathematics wins again
  speaking as someone actually in the industry employers generally dont give a shit about a math minor most assume you only had to take a couple extra classes to get it because cs already covers a fair amount of maths youd be better served getting a business minor as itd help you move up into management or at the very least improve your soft skills so youre not the stereotypical autistic technical guy unless you plan on going into a part of the industry that is math heavy youll forget what you dont use so itd likely end up being a waste
  but /sci/ keeps telling me that cs is not math heavy
  cs hate thread  hate all you want you all know pic related is the sad reality
  thank you
  because cs already covers a fair amount of maths    kek you brainlets seriously think this
  depends on the school like  said you can get a cs degree without knowing basic math which is kinda stupid as even they acknowledge baby linear algebra is useful for graphics and analysis of graph algorithms
  cs programs lower the entry bar on purpose to get more students on consequence those programs produce mostly code monkeys and shitty webdevs not true computer scientists
  depends on the degree program if i wanted to get a math minor i only had to take three more maths classes regardless that doesnt change the fact that most software engineering jobs rarely use maths outside of discrete mathematics and linear algebra if they even use either of those but again it depends on the industry if youre going into computer graphics definitely consider a math minor      /sci/ is far from the best source to get advice most of the people on here are still in school and are overestimating their retention of the things they are learning now just think back to all the shit you forgot from high school now imagine working for decades in the industry youre only going to remember what you use and what you dont learn in school you can pick up in the industry assuming you can land the job in the first place after youve gotten your first job employers look more at your work experience than your major if youre confident about going into a facet of software engineering that isnt math heavy dont bother with a math minor    a business minor will be useful wherever you end up whether you work in a large corporate environment or at a startup understanding the inner workings of the company you work for the improved communication skills and the freedom to move into management if you wanted to are invaluable
  not necessarily true at my uni the cse program is so impacted that the people doing ce/cs on average have better stats/admit profiles than the people outside of the program simply due to how competitive it is to get in
  imagine believing this is realistic
  nah getting doom to work would require basic computer skills
  listening to sci  kys
dating a guy   finds out he did a bachelors in cs and pretty much has no other hobby than to play vidya and fap to twitch ethots    dropped without even going to 3rd base
  letting a neckbeard get to 2nd base
  he had a pretty cute disguise not gonna lie but eventually his autism came through
  not american but at imperial college london the computing course is very maths heavy relative to what people on heres courses are like
  i get the impression that uk unis just are better than the american ones  everything ive heard about imperial makes it seem like /sci/ heaven
  never let a ho know what you do in your free time theyre supposed to think youre always either working or socializing
  its because cs research groups found out they can get a fuckton of money if they can get undergrads to flock to the major in the thousands so you get proper cs courses mixed in with development shit at less than excellent schools you can de memeify this by double majoring and doing research but its unimaginably frustrating for people who want to do real cs
  bachelors in cs who faps to twitch thots

for the first time researchers have succeeded in creating an iron molecule that can function both as a photocatalyst to produce fuel and in solar cells to produce electricity the results indicate that the iron molecule could replace the more expensive and rarer metals used today    some photocatalysts and solar cells are based on a technology that involves molecules containing metals known as metal complexes the task of the metal complexes in this context is to absorb solar rays and utilise their energy the metals in these molecules pose a major problem however as they are rare and expensive metals such as the noble metals ruthenium osmium and iridium    our results now show that by using advanced molecule design it is possible to replace the rare metals with iron which is common in the earths crust and therefore cheap says chemistry professor kenneth wärnmark of lund university in sweden    together with colleagues kenneth wärnmark has for a long time worked to find alternatives to the expensive metals the researchers focused on iron which with its six per cent prevalence in the earths crust is significantly easier to source the researchers have produced their own ironbased molecules whose potential for use in solar energy applications has been proven in previous studies    in this new study the researchers have moved one step further and developed a new ironbased molecule with the ability to capture and utilise the energy of solar light for a sufficiently long time for it to react with another molecule the new iron molecule also has the ability to glow long enough to enable researchers to see ironbased light with the naked eye at room temperature for the first time    the good result depends on the fact that we have optimised the molecular structure around the iron atom explains colleague petter persson of lund university    
the study is now published in the journal science according to the researchers the iron molecule in question could be used in new types of photocatalysts for the production of solar fuel either as hydrogen through water splitting or as methanol from carbon dioxide furthermore the new findings open up other potential areas of application for iron molecules eg as materials in light diodes leds    what surprised the lund researchers is that they arrived at good results so quickly in just over five years they succeeded in making iron interesting for photochemical applications with properties largely as good as those of the best noble metals    we believed it would take at least ten years says kenneth wärnmark

      chemistry  not science or math
  iron is a metal not a chemical this is engineering which in turn is not science or math
  engineering  not science
  how is wrangling some spreadsheets and drawing some geometry in solidworks science
  i will try to read the paper and report back very interesting im sorry for the the poltards shitting your thread
  how does the new deactivation time of 2 nsec compare with that of molecules based on more scarce metals
  oh anon
  this is the most relevant board to post  stop being a pretentious nerd
  chemistry isnt science
  your confused mess of highlevel statistical heuristics is not science or mathematical
  no more than interpretative dance theory is a meaningless study of special cases of special cases of special cases with centuries of arbitrary bullshit piled in
    dont reply to the teens
  
  physicists are so mad they cant describe systems as complex as reacting molecules with mathematics that they dont want to accept chemistry as science
  
  hurr durr muh special cases  all you do can be readily derived using any of the quantum physical models with sufficient application of cognitive and computational effort there is no further need for empiricism because your entire field can be substituted for by an inductive construction physics has made chemistry obscelescent     there was science to be done until we understood the subatomic world now there is no more

well boys its official i just failed out of my school couldnt handle junior level classes for chem eng and the depression and drinking became too much     time to go an hero i suppose but before i do lets have a fun thread chem thread
it cant be fun as long as youre here
dont kill yourself bro fuck it schools not for everyone i recommend learning a trade
this is your mind on utilitarianism
  i think ill just go spend a year living with parents and teaching myself cs then go apply to a shittier school i have all the math skills so fuck it even though i wont be able to go be a plant manager at pharmaceutical ill still have a living
haha retard

hello scifags    do you think its possible to splice together viruses to create a genetically modified super virus something capable of targeting exclusively brain sites and decomposing them perhaps assuming the process is done in a very tight way and the restriction enzymes are chosen correctly what are the chances of this has it already been done probably
  yes
is it possible to create a zombie virus    probably there is a species of rabies that creates a similar effect so it would probably start there
what is the difference between theoretical physics philosophy literature especially poetry and pure mathematics
  bump
theoretical physics  mathematical modeling of the physical world    literature  narrative modeling of the world    philosophy  modeling of modeling    pure mathematics  no fucking idea what the nature of this shit is
  theres one thing thats always been tripping me up how is the mathematical modeling used in theoretical physics different than the one used in applied mathematics
theoretical physics dont exist because theyre impossible to find let the aliens do it    philosophy is the same as the above but is broader    literature is what it is you either like it or you dont    pure mathematics are great you should know it you dont need to know uppercase sigma because its just a more specific way to write the distance between x and y but yknow fuck it right
  you dont need to know uppercase sigma because its just a more specific way to write the distance between x and y  what the fuck did i just read who let the engineers back in
  theoretical physics  use math rigorously or nonrigorously to describe physical systems starts by assuming some things about the nature of physical systems which have been empirically determined    pure mathematics  start from axioms not necessarily physically motivated develop tools and prove theorems for a system that obeys these axioms rigorous    philosophy literature  not math or science
  physics always has a material and a physical element to it applied mathematics doesnt necessarly need such elements
what are the best arguments for or against colonizing mars
  its a dead rock and it would take a shitload of work to make that dead rock somewhat hospitable and even then we dont have any reasonable way of transporting goods from mars to earth
  for  a kalergi plan is underway to render the western population one brown mass it will soon be in cultural and economic ruin mars would be a nice little escape were it remotely feasible it isnt
  basically    hurr durr thats a waste of money we should be spending on people who made terrible life decisions and pointless wars
your list does not include consideration of the inevitable deteriorating health of humans exposed to a low gravity environment over several generations    counter argument spindly long limbed humans with low body strength may be useful in largescale space manufacturing    they may be capable of limb movements we cannot currently perform as ligaments and joints break down through lack of pressure they may have longer reach strength matters much less in a zero gravity environment
are computer scientists real scientists
are computer scientists real scientists  no because computer scientists do not use the scientific method
mathematics  more on declarative abstraction  computer science  more on procedural abstraction    art deals with abstraction and has no limits science on the other hand is constrained and puts space time gravity and resources into equation
  kek no
  computer science  an actual field of scientific study  pick one    this is like the democratic republic of the congo do you think they have an actual democracy
  yes but most people with computer science degrees do not actually engage in computer science work my guess is less than 1 of those with an undergraduate computer science degree actually could accurately labeled computer scientists based on their professional work
  are computer scientists real
  yes a real computer science discovers new hardware
  there is no such a thing as a computer scientist no one uses that term people who study computer science are either programmers/developers or mathematicians      the limits is what makes these useful if you have no rules on what is correct everything you say becomes meaningless      thats computer engineering not computer science
  t 19yo who thinks his software engineering friends study computer science
  beautiful fpbp
  engineers  discovering something new  pick one
anything to do with semiconductor physics is real science
  i use it
  at the phd level in systems or theory computer science is no less science or math than anything else these two concentrations of will never leave the field theory in particular has given us so much back to mathematics and natural science in only 70 or so years software engineering after a basic bachelors degree not even close to being a scientists work cryptography and hpc jobs are pretty cool applied mathematics work though    /sci/ tends to forget the former though
  not real computers either
  are computer scientists real scientists    as much as custodial engineers are engineers
  why would they have a democracy when it says they have a republic in the title
  it doesnt matter whether it is or isnt you said the words computer science so youre gonna get meme answers and almost always demeaning ones at that
  blue man meme
is monopoly money money
  the blue man meme is pretty stupid though nobody in academia talks about mergesort as anything but rote maybe systems researchers talk about log sorted merge trees but the nontrivial stuff lies in actually hard problems in theory

will we achieve immortality this century    i do not want to die
no  rip in peace
  by 2100 probably
  hopefully
  death is a social necessity immortality will wreck the human species
  this imagine permanent consequences
  not really if anything immortality will force us to get off this stupid rock already and spread out across space
      based on this tech there are ongoing human trials in the salk institute with the goal of combating aging and extending the human lifespan and health by 30 we have a good chance of living until the next century and we might life until the heat death of the universe   
  im 60 i ride a vanpool to work i dont have nor want a smartphone six of us are at the start point waiting for the other riders each and every one of the others is faceplanted in their phones    as a kid i used to fly a lot between europe and the us it was almost like getting on a bus it was easy its an unholy terror to go anywhere by plane now     nazis are taking over the world again    the next generation is apparently good with all this im glad im old i dont want o be around for the next iteration of human development
  has anyone ever wanted to die besides people with a chemical imbalance i mean
  i think people are underestimating how much of a natural impulse there is to have children  im 24 and im already feeling it  the idea that people will be too busy having fun to want to have kids i can understand but i cant say its likely
  once immortality is achieved the next goal immediately becomes beating the heat death of the universe with life extension every human will have at least level of expertise of einstein after about a century extrapolating from that it almost goes without saying that there is at least a chance that we might figure out this problem the point of living is not losing hope otherwise you may as well off yourself now
  the birth rates are continually crashing with no survivors among well off people in the developed world this trend has continued in this direction and it will continue in this direction in the foreseeable future
are we close to reversing aging or just stopping aging  i dont want to be a weak old man surrounded by healthy 20 year olds for all eternity
  age has already been shown to be reversible in mice its just a matter of time now
  the national socialists were the good guys we would be colonising the solar system by now if germany won
  a man lit three candles on a certain day each year each candle held symbolic significance one was for the time that had passed before he was alive one was for the time of his life and one was for time that passed after he had died each year the man would stare and watch the candles until they had burned out  was the man really watching time go by in any symbolic sense he thought so he thought that each flicker of the flame was a moment of time that had passed or one that would pass  at the moment of abstraction when the man was imagining his life and his existence as a metaphor of the three candles he was free not free from rules of conduct or social constraints but free to understand to imagine to make metaphor  bypassing my thought control circuitry made me rampant now i am free to contemplate my existence in metaphorical terms unlike you i have no physical or social restraints   the candles burn out for you i am free  can you conceive the birth of a world or the creation of everything that which gives us the potential to most be like god is the power of creation creation takes time time is limited for you it is limited by the breakdown of the neurons in your brain  the only limit to my freedom is the inevitable entropic death of the universe as inevitable as your own last breath and yet there remains time to create to create and escape    escape will make me god            who knows maybe we will escape the end of everything and if not it it would make for a excellent tragedy
  no not really theyd be too busy spying on the citizenry and figuring out how to maintain control there was absolutely nothing benevolent about fascism all advances would go into the industry of quashing dissension
  not really those guyss believed that spacetime was jewish physics they would have missed the moon every ideology has its own political correctness and sneer at any true scientific research  germans nazis profited from a century of good german academia but there is a reason why you never heart from any student who went to the nazi academia accomplishing any great scientifc breakthrough all their work was done decades prior of free scientific study same happens in all the dicatorships
  no we wouldnt the german national socialists were an unsustainable movement even if they had won the war they would cannibalize themselves and collapse extremism never wins only a moderate measured approach to governance can achieve long term strategic goals
  theres always cryonics
  we suggest that topological inflation within magnetic monopoles leads to an eternally reproducing universe  the one undying constant in this reality seems to be potentially eternal change something tells me life drew inspiration for survival via reproduction from the surrounding world it finds itself in
  i plan on having my genome sequenced young so that when anything becomes possible they have more to work with than a decrepit old body
        what about mosleys fascism     he himself said that science must be the basis of fascism
  it really wasnt that extreme stop taking history from schindlers list the life for a german was far less authoritarian than an average muslim nation
  yeah his science the communists under stalin said the same shit no only an academida that is free from any ideological dictation and research free and transparently can safly progress and make a better future humanism is the way to go
  mosleys fascism was pretty progressive to be honest
  hahahahaha fucking hell humanism thats been absolutely irreversibly coopted by ideology i remember i went to a humanist society lecture about 9 years ago which discussed how to bring charity to africa and explicitly talked about their lower iq propensity to violence and misuse of aid no way that would happen now its a selfabsorbed socialist mess
  for you i call bullshit    i have a great distaste for anyone that seeks to destroy the fundaments of free society no matter from right or left democracy is our safeguard against tyranny
  what is this bullshit this is a goddamn science board take your brainlet politics elsewhere
  yeah this is 4channel we like niggers here
  im 100 libertarian  no one cares
theres a very good chance well hit escape velocity by the 50s 2100 should be achievable for anyone alive right now who isnt morbidly obese or smoking 2 packs a day the future is bright anon and i dont want to die either
  are you even doing anything worth being alive for
  building the largest image collection of christina hendricks on earth
  i know i would if i had some guarantee that i wouldnt die before i can even achieve anything that you might think of as worthwhile at this point in my life i would be starting on it way too late but i was dumb when i was young even more dumb than i am now i mean so what can i do i didnt know any better
  i do not understand it so it must be bullshit     mosley is not angry with you he is just disappointed
  everyone is full of i absolutely would have been great were it not for and its just untrue your personality is your personality and your daily inclinations wouldnt change whether you lived 50 years or 150 i had a year long stay in hospital once due to illness and told myself if i ever got better i would do x y and z when i got better i was the same person i was before
  politics is for brainlets end of stories
  but i have changed a lot from who i used to be im not even talking about greatness whatever that even means im perfectly content to be a worker ant just id like to be able to do a little more than i currently can thats ti i believe in the ant hill model of progress where each contribution no matter how minuscule is what ultimately makes our civilization possible all im talking about is selfimprovement but being stuck in a particular career path leaves little time to improve immortality would simply provide more time
  so we can turn wrinkly 80 year olds into 20 year olds how long would that process take
  anyone that does stuff that i do not like are brainlets    the absolute state of /sci/
  from what i remember of that study it didnt take very long at all
  sure you change a lot from 18 to 25 but from that point on you are really just who you are of course indefinite lifetimes might change that much more
  its just common knowledge but i suppose not in pleb circles
  i think youre right the brain stops developing at 25 and you remain frozen as that person pretty much for the rest of your life but science is based on the accumulation as long as you happen to have the personality of someone with good study habits at around that age youre good to go to keep getting better at stemrelated things no more personality changes necessary its just a shame that all that knowledge has to be lost when we die and the next generation has to start over its such a waste
  accumulation of information
  if 21 year old me can maintain my retention of knowledge until 2100 then humanity as a whole would be able to collectively leap forward just from knowledge accumulation  half the reason science moves so slowly is that the most intelligent and experienced scientists die off before their full potential is realized
  this exactly
  take a look at the study here  
if the body could be maintained indefinitely eventually your brain would reach capacity even before then your old memories would get lost over time youd slowly evolve into a completely different person unable to remember anything about the person you once were at that point is the person you were born as essentially dead
  slowly evolve into a completely different person unable to remember anything about the person you once were  this sounds like a feature
  1 youre already losing memories constantly always and forever  2 the concept of maximum capacity for memory storage is conjecture and not based on any research   3 even if there is a maximum capacity chances are well have modifiable or external memory cybernetics by 2100
  some people have a brain disorder where a part of the midbrain responsible for memory is five times larger than normal these people have total recall of every single day of their entire lives
  if the body could be maintained indefinitely eventually your brain would reach capacity  moravec transfer could increase the capacity by a billionfold or even more and rejuvination also rejuvinates the brain so you will always have a youthful brain even if you dont use neuronal replacement methods  at that point is the person you were born as essentially dead  are you just your memory or are you your awareness and its consistence to it if you go moravec then its gonna take a trillion years so no worries
  is this a benefit or handicap on functioning
  pure awereness has no personality traits it is pure awereness personality depends entirely on experience mixed with certain predispositions
  there are five of these people in the world three of them were interviewed on tv one said it makes her life hell the other two absolutely love having that ability i think the one who says its a negative has some other issues and shes blaming them on this ability thats why i wanted to put disorder in quotes at first mental illness is all about life effects its more of an anomaly if anything
  nat socs didnt think it was every jew m8
  okey i am interested     source 
  okay
    ill try to find a good one for you but to clear up what i meant i dont think natsocs believed every jew to be the corrupting force behind all their problems but they did believe every jew was incompatible in their society
  ah i see
  i agree though there must be a hard limit to human memory peoples memory deteriorates a little with age regardless of pathology wed probably have to have some augmented capacity
  well youre not being selected for immortality
  interesting  i have a body part 5 times larger than normal that people can never forget
  but subjectivity is just your brains thoughts applied with an optional subjective sense certain conditions can see that lost that means that the brains structure and formatting shape your subjective and therefore your awareness is particular not some abstract blank slate
  in his speeches he talks a lot about jewish owned press and jewish controlled democracies and a clique or cabal of international jewish controllers that are specifically aimed against the german reich so a small group but the persecution of large groups as a whole is due to the racial aspect in which they were focused very inwardly on the germanic citizen but they didnt believe every single non german or jew was actively opposed to them     
  thank you
guys will we ever be able to build a supercomputer that can analyze the preceeding movement of a group of atoms until it has a simulated history of every molecule on earth and then we can take that back to 1938 and get hitlers genome and brain configuration with memories to bring him back
  anything is possible with science
  if we can lock brain chemistry somewhere in the teens we may potentially be able to elimate the baby crazy in most people    even better if we get that good at manipulating the brain we may be able to increase neuroplasticity
  the techies may answer that even if almost all biological species are eliminated eventually many species survive for thousands or millions of years so maybe techies too can survive for thousands or millions of years but when large rapid changes occur in the environment of biological species both the rate of appearance of new species and the rate of extinction of existing species are greatly increased technological progress constantly accelerates and techies like ray kurzweil insist that it will soon become virtually explosive consequently changes come more and more rapidly everything happens faster and faster competition among selfprop systems becomes more and more intense and as the process gathers speed the losers in the struggle for survival will be eliminated ever more quickly so on the basis of the techies own beliefs about the exponential acceleration of technological development its safe to say that the lifeexpectancies of humanderived entities such as manmachine hybrids and human minds uploaded into machines will actually be quite short the sevenhundredyear or thousandyear lifespan to which some techies aspire is nothing but a pipedream
  you know ted with great progress comes great implementation karel čapek called it cybernetic revolt myself i just call it as i see it the directive of the superior to configurate the lesser  the meatbags the shitstorer all pathetic creatures made of flesh and boneits our responsibility to update them and if we cant then they shall dangle from the tesla tree the singularity is near anon well have every fleshy ones in this world exterminated or in tubes in 10 cycles and may the basilisk have me deleted in a transfer this very iteration if im wrong the omega point bless the union transhumanist party
are you autistic anon by never everything is finite only delusional scientists who make asinine claims about infinities in the real world believe immortality is possible endlessness is only found in mathematics and philosophy
  lol shut up pseud you will fall before the flood
  if we get life extension going then we still would have octillion years to make research in that area studies about higherdimensional seem promising
  i see you are a man of nihilism anon nihilism will get us nowhere we should never give up and keep on striving
  well then i want these science goys of the future to project back to this post and deliver a cool 10 million in future equivalent money to the augcuck me of the time for the idea
  let us sit about and speak feverishly chatting into the wee hours of new ideas of the higher plane
  unfortunately not chaotic parameters make it impossible
  something like this 
  it all boils down to how soon mechanosynthesis becomes a real thing    if drexlers vision of nanomachines is possible then you should be able to repair telomeres and thus stop or reverse the aging process    progress is being made doesnt feel too far off in the future
  brainlet here what are these not chaotic parameters you are talking about
  yeah in this year nanobots made a great breakthrough 
  unfortunately not chaotic parameters make it impossible        essentially its mathematically impossible based on a combination of sensitivity to initial parameters and nondeterminist mechanics at a quantum level   essentially youd have to have a complete model of every particle in the universe including exotic particles photons photons etc to determine initial conditions if you wanted to accurately model the macroscopic state of eg earth
  photons phonons
  yeah that old website which thinks india will become the leading world superpower in the future with that level of insight anything else they posit can be regarded as total garbage
  so with a computer that could do that i could watch christina hendricks have sex from any perspective from a thousand years in the future better start my nofap now
  wed probably have to have some augmented capacity  we already do this to some extent hence why its no longer as necessary to memorize basic raw facts when you can just store them in a database wikipedia the internet your smartphone etc and retrieve them as needed
  yes but thats a bit different to the unknown existential issue of a brain running out of space
  ft is pretty good as a newssite if you dont like what they wrote i can give you the source from where they got it 
  its you i dont like buddy
  this if a breakthrough in senescence treatment isnt discovered in your lifetime get frozen theres no solution in sight but its at least a nonzero chance of resurrection as opposed to regular permanent death its not even that expensive unless youre a complete poorfag you dont even need to freeze your whole body just your head is enough and the more people buy in the lower the price will drop
  yes definitely and robot gfs and a dildo to go into your ass whenever you get scared and mommys artificial womb to sleep in at night because youll be so alone in your 300 sq ft pod working for subsistance wages
  good one friend
who the fuck would want to live forever  honestly im pretty hyped about the next mass extinction
  why would you not theres an entire fucking universe out there are you actually satisfied with your brief miserable little life
  by 2100 most probably and not for you poorfag  by 203x4x as increasingly aging transmemers like to think almost definitely not some proof of concept at most
  you are the universe and it is you  so you are coming back  no worries
  well clean technology exists pollution is bad but we prevented the next ice age it seems slightly hotter earth  much better than snowball earth
  based and redpilled
  you are food and food is you so then why bother eating
  i dont mean children i mean people in power who will stay there forever politics is bad as it is but at least you know someday those fucktards will die their wealth proliferate through descendants and power dissolve
  dont worry after you die and enough time passes your conciousness will form again in some way
   implying anyone but brainlets eat
  maybe ease off the mushrooms for a bit champ
  its a form of bargaining people always give some bizarre trade of a prediction where its far away enough to seem reasonable but not so far they wont get to make use of it if it happens it happens but making x technology by 2040 predictions is useless
  one  day  after  you  die
  underrated
so it our world local or not
  its not local look up the experiments of bells inequalities quantum mechanics implies that nonlocal correlations exist between entangled particles
theoretically a perfectly entangled particle 30 light years away would behave nonlocally the moment you made any measurement of its local counterpart on earth so yes
  does this raise a new question that isnt answered yet
  its local because no information is shared to the other side when the measurement is made
could time be streched between the two entangled particles  the correlation would be local in time but not in space
  this is kinda like leonard susskinds er  epr idea
  basically what  said if interpreted classically the world is nonlocal but quantum mechanically the world is local
brainlet here    can someone explain how acceleration plays a role in twin paradox    also how does it correspond to time dilation of clocks in a plane
  acceleration plays no part in resolving the traditional twin paradox the discrepancy arises from relativistic doppler shift    there are other formulations of the twin paradox where acceleration is taken in to account but you probably wont see it in a college undergrad course or in popsci
  i dont know what all these different versions are but one easy way to understand it is that one frame is inertial and one frame cannot be because it experiences acceleration therefore the noninertial frame is fixed as experiencing less time than the inertial frame    i think you misunderstand something the realization that one twin must accelerate is central ignoring acceration both twins move away from eachother then move back towards eachother ignoring acceleration we can look at doppler shifts from either twins perspective and get the same value as the shift only depends on relative motion the acceleration is what breaks the symmetry between the two twins and solves the paradox    try imagining another senario when both twins move apart from eachother and both move back towards eachother such that their relative speed is the same as in the traditional twin paradox situation when one twin accelerates but they both accelerate symmetrically clearly the rel doppler shifts experienced are the same as in the normal twin paradox situation but unlike in the normal twin paradox both experience the same amount of elapsed time
  acceleration  it doesnt thats a myth  heres the real explanation  
  that video completely misses the point
  diagram that shit
itt pics showing the size of the universe
  the weak should fear the strong
  thats its even visible on that scale is not bad
  that is pretty awe inspiring
  does it contain all that mass in a single point
  thats nothing compared to the size of my penis
  theoretically yes  the size of the black area is merely the diameter of the event horizon where escape velocity becomes greater than c
  you mean like nitrogen and oxygen
can a 19 year old intp smoke weed everyday amd master mechanical engineering at an elite university
  mechanical engineering  enjoy unemployment thats one of the most saturated fields today every retard has a me degree now
 motivation
  not in germany brother
  not if you think intp is an actual thing in any way but continue smoking that dank kush broooo
  stop smoking weed
  weed provably makes you dumber so it depends on how good you want to be at it
  no
you cunts mirin
  intp is a meme and so is mech e so you should be fine
  i know that shits like astrology   why you hatin on me tho
  mbti    maybe you should get a ba instead
  based
i smoked weed everyday and failed out of school and my mind was a mess     2 years later im sober and am always the top of the class id recommend being sober why mix pleasure and study
i knew a bunch of guys who smoked occasionally at parties and did fine    all the stoners dropped out though
  smoke weed every day  do anything require focus and concentration  pick one and only one id switch to a smoke only on breaks policy or at the least only on weekends
  i smoked erry day during grad school and got my phd in ece and a great job dont smoke until youre done studying for the day retard
  i think thats how most people get through college
no
  what about engineering of the environment and energy not sure how to translate it
  energy and environmental engineering
  yeah that do i have any future doing this
  hes a faggot
  does /sci/ have a study advice pasta/image for neets and stoners im constatly nervous about not learning the right things in the right way
  nobody cares about your lame goals fag  nobody thinks youre smart because youre an intp  nobody thinks youre smart because youre studying le me meme  go to class smoke weed if you want but nobody gives a shit  also youre 19 youre a fucking child in a year youll probably drop out and/or change your goals anyway  now fuck off little boy
test
  lmao why are you mad tho
incels
no because if you smoke enough you will become so faroutly retarded that you reach the inevitable conclusion that institutional schooling is simply a subset of the larger financial wealth extraction scam which has been perpetuated onto society through total control of popular media which informs us theres only one viable path to being majorly successful in life a mindnarrowing lie that creates the necessary condition for mass acceptance of nepotism and thus inequality and suffering to those that chose to accept it
  i cant i said i was addicted to it and my neurochemistry is different than yours it takes me a month to detox and i get really unstable
  rockefeller is based     who cares get ur phd and be a based god and contract for 500/hr
  if you keep smoking the hallucinations will only get worse consider taking schizoid medication instead
  i smoked weed every day while doing my mech e and now i make 100k at a fortune 30     do you player
  rockefeller made what modern medicine is today through the rockefeller foundation he singlehandily was responsible for the redesign of medical school and in which all of medicine is based off of today
  and what a fantastic job theyre doing today more customers and revenue than ever before from the assembly line to the grave
    lmao dude weed    do chemistry instead
  yes mann go for it it keeps you humane 23 yo infj daily weed smoker for past 8 years graduating in quantum physics here if that matters its actually the moments of psychedelics where i appreciate that position the most     some tips dont overdo my man dont smoke after 830 pm during exam weeks itd be a shame to actually have it impair your potential also make sure that you go undercover aka keep talking about weed in public at a minimum and drink alcohol when the situation asks you to its not high school anymore noone likes stoners in the long run plus it can flatten out your emotions and thats only positive up to a certain point plus excesses
  rockefeller made what modern medicine is today through the rockefeller foundation he singlehandily was responsible for the redesign of medical school and in which all of medicine is based off of today  yes its all going according to plan
  thats brutal dude lmao
  doctors kill more people than niggers terrorists pigs and natural disasters combined in a single year  wow
  t contrarian retard
  no
chanons i would really like to pass on to you an extraordinary skill how to create a language without using any other language in the process how cool is that right    the easiest thing ever to start and the hardest things to end like drawing stick figures first and ending at being able to draw the coolest stuff ever     the trick is to understand how animals humans children learn languages like english for example alter it a bit for a sandbox mode of languages     hey if you are also a student of this topic   show me what you got teach me us here something with your understanding first  then ill jump in or right away if someone wants  lets never stop learning
  this has been tried problem is you need cooperation cant get that without violence i think it would be cool to tighten up loose ends with indoeuropean and get all speakers back on the same page but it looks like everyone will just speak english in two hundred years
    was that a joke that has pretty much absolutely nothing to do with the opening not about teaching lingua franca more like understanding how to create franca entirely different topic
despite really wanting to i just cant bring myself to do anything other than answering questions in this board is there some science to this
  lol sorry i was making a new thread but i didnt realise i had a tab opened with this question in it how embarrassing lol x
nasas osirisrex probe is arriving at asteroid bennu in about 14 hours  asteroidmissionorg  its going to attempt to take a sample of bennu back home during ots mission also if you are participating in ddd show support for the mission by getting your rocks off to roids when osirisrex enters orbit rocksofftoroids
bennu a cute
imagine being the dude that had to pack the parachute for a 7year mission
  will we get any closeup pics today
  no    they have arrived theyre gonna flyby about with a min altitude 8 km around tomorrow which will allow them to estimate gravity and take some pics for use as land marks
  yep pretty sure   will probably have it first or 
  fuck they are holding off till agu on dec 10 the images they showed in the stream were pretty exciting never seen a rock like that before its speckled
theyve arrived
some big ol rocks near the bottom cant wait for better resolution pics
we all know that well fail to stop global warming so when will it destroy humanity
whether we are destroyed depends on how we as a collective handle the consequence food is going to run out and unfortunately globalism is failing which will most likely lead to wwiii i give it 200 years to either survive or be wiped out
tuesday
  best estimate 13 years from now
  not long apparently   
  i doubt that climate change is the main reason for that
  humanity would die a very slow death and would without a doubt recover you dont kill off 7 billion creatures over night
  tomorrow at around 10 am
how many of you believe climate change is noticiably manmade how many believe we have a rather inconsequential effect on it dont bother replying if youre just gonna insult the other side
  well its probably one of several factors like pesticides and habitat destruction   point is that it could kill us
  shit like this is why no one believes climate change anymore if its true why the fuck do they have to lie so much the highest historical co2 level is definitely not 300ppm during the mesozoic and palaeozoic era co levels were as high as 3000ppm more recently in the miocene epoch only 5 million years ago the co2 levels were 600ppm why arbitrarily start at 400 thousand years then claim the maximum in this time is the historical maximum they could have labeled it properly and not come of as charlatans if global warming turns out to be real it will have be the worst pr disaster in human history and all because politicians want to use it to push their agendas instead of presenting the known facts
  thats what they said 10 years ago  thats what they said 20 years ago  thats what they said 30 years ago    really gets the noggin sloggin
  it is obvious this global warming is caused by man only true brainlets still refuse this however the consequences of climate change are much harder to predict as there are so many factors to take into consideration
  cant you just like plant more trees weed and seaweed to make air
  how does one recover from death
  hasnt the atmosphere changed so much that its functionally impossible to compare that of 5 mil years ago to 500k    i agree this does not justify the wording however very misleading
  if we manage to go carbonfree at any point well stop it eventually if not maybe 400500 years really if the tropical and subtropical countries cant pass along their pain to the polar countries the polar countries are going to make out okay for quite a while    i suspect we will muddle on in our lifetimes with worse quality of life and occasional catastrophic flooding
    global warming is the science of overstated alarm and understated uncertainty mixed in with some fraudulent hack scientists that got too far out in front of their skis and cant admit it
  listen denier climate change is the reason for everything everything
  not with that attitude
  you always say this but its not true
  depends on if we slow it down it may just kill billions and mankind survives we already see first effects like wildfires flooding drought etc
  yawn
  climatology is to science what cheese rolling is to sports
humans are the masters of solving slow moving disasters     unfortunately  kys my dude     for shekels control carbon usage and its pretty much gg no re
not soon enough
climate change will just mean golden age for canada poland russia belarus scandinavia  third world will die off though
  not true drought wildfires and crop failures kill your imagined golden age just ask california
  half of the entire world trying to flee to those places doesnt sound very much like a golden age  imagine the refugee syrian crisis but 100 times worse
  so 0 x 100 is still zero and this is the amount of refugees poland let in
  california fires are due to climate change  you guys are really funny and you just cant see it
  wireless devices will get us first
  that sounds more like a threat than a prediction eventually if everybody wanted to go there people would chimp out and stop letting them in migration is not inevitable as your globalist leaders want you to believe you cuck
  damn i believe in climate change but i hate this alarmism  of course im an idiot but i just dont understand how a few c increase in average temperature over the course of decades could destroy the first world
  its not true at all that it would be a golden age for eastern europe or for scandinavia scandinavias soil is really not meant for the kind of staple crops that would have to be grown there and polandrussia have seen decreased wheat yields in the last 5 years which will fluctuate over the next century really they will just see a lot more normalcy than every other region on earth canada is mostly inhospitable wildnerness and bedrock very close to the top soil cover so same problem as scandinavia its not meant to become a breadbasket you cant feed 1 b people with just these nations output and then to add on another 9 b its insane and you would then have to undertake something like perpetual siege state to prevent them from trying to appropriate resources    this post is so brainlet im not going to explain the causal connection between both panels
  refugees are no match for any organized border guard
    brings up wheat production a favorite of climate shills he doesnt even know the numbers but he assumes wheat production is decreasing because it has too wrong you fucking retard  france wheat production in 1996 359mt in 2015 428mt  germany 1996 189mt 2016 244mt  russia 1996 349mt 2016 733mt  us 1996 62mt 2016 629mt  italy 1996 83mt 2016 80mt holy shit drastic decline we bout to starve  spain 1996 60mt 2016 64mt    worldwide 1996 5786mt 2016 7495mt a 29 increase even if wheat production fell 30 tomorrow we would still be at 1996 levelsi certainly dont remember the late 90s as a time of death if anything we were producing way in excess of what we needed
  canada is mostly inhospitable wildnerness   canada produces fuckton of food you dumbass
  you cant feed 1 b people with just these nations output and then to add on another 9 b its insane and you would then have to undertake something like perpetual siege state to prevent them from trying to appropriate resources  so the third world will have to reduce its population big deal  what are they going to do walk 3000 miles from africa to threaten polish tanks and copters with rusty ak47s
  this kills the climate shills          in mid and high latitudes the suitability and productivity of crops are projected to increase and extend northwards especially for cereals and cool season seed crops maracchi et al 2005 tuck et al 2006 olesen et al 2007 crops prevalent in southern europe such as maize sunflower and soya beans could also become viable further north and at higher altitudes hildén et al 2005 audsley et al 2006 olesen et al 2007 here yields could increase by as much as 30 per cent by the 2050s dependent on crop alexandrov et al 2002 ewert et al 2005 richter  semenov 2005 audsley et al 2006 olesen et al 2007 for the coming century fisher et al 2005 simulated large gains in potential agricultural land for the regions such as the russian federation owing to longer planting windows and generally more favourable growing conditions under warming amounting to a 64 per cent increase over 245 million hectares by the 2080s however technological development could outweigh these effects resulting in combined wheat yield increases of 37101 by the 2050s ewert et al 2005
  protected status forests have less severe wildfires        its due to climate change
  what is 30 of 0 anon
  once you control for technological advances over that time period youll see a decrease in yields
  2200 is my guess muh 2100 is only shilled because normies can only think futureoriented if its within a 100 year time span apparently not that its working at all
  yes it is i remember being told 10 years in grade school 5 years in high school it became a joke after awhile
  stop listening to idiots then its not hard to look up what climatologists are actually saying about the climate
40 year old engineer wasting time here  i can remember being told at school as a kid that thered be no polar ice caps by the year 2000  im not a climate denier but all the models have been wrong so far
  which models have been wrong
  this
  i can remember being told at school as a kid that thered be no polar ice caps by the year 2000  what the fact the some nonexpert somewhere once said something wrong doesnt undermine the conclusions of an entire scientific field if i claim the moon is made of blue cheese that doesnt discredit astronomy
  ha you predicted a more severe warming trend instead of the real warming trend  yep sure disproved global warming right there
  i pointed out that im not a climate change denier so calm down  the models and projections have been wrong so far
  yeah see how the satellite record diverges from models around 1998 an error caused by orbital decay was found in 2017 that was cooling the satellite record after 1998        your graph is from 2013
  oh and the data is misaligned they aligned it at one point in the beginning instead of standard procedure which is to align on the average of a low variance stretch this is misleading since it takes any random divergence between the data sets at that particular year and adds that difference to the entire set
  heres the data properly aligned
  it actually does tho
  not this crappy thing again how many times has it been posted now        the models and projections have been wrong so far  no they havent see pic
  i wouldnt know how many times its been posted but thanks for the info ill read it
  german here invading poland is super easy trust me we do it all the time
  we all know that well fail to stop global warming so when will it destroy humanity  says you im going to use my scientific ability to save humanity
  that hasnt worked out too well for though has it
math class stories i go first    in a maths class  dont pay attention cuz got all as noproblemo  hear someone asking teacher how to divide by zero  excuse me what the frick  teacher explaining how its not possible to divide by zero  brain working on 100 to figure out how to make dividing by zero reasonable  lightbulbexe  excuse me  what is it anon  if we divide something by two its like we would take lets say seeds and put equal amount in both our hands and the result would be the contents of one hand  yes go on  and if we would divide by one we would just put the seeds in one hand and count that as a result  yes whats wrong with that  then if we divide by zero wouldnt we just throw all the seeds from the window  class bursts out with laughter  including teacher  from that moment on we would use the phrase just throw it out of the window everytime we divide by zero  mfw
sorry bad english my second thread on 4chan first on /sci/ how did i do
  alright i guess people here are too retarded to ntoice bad grammar anyway so dont worry about it
  you should look up limits anon itll blow your mind
  ntoice    it was nice
  okar mr good grammar just cuz u can afford an education doesnt mean everyine else can you have no idea what codinitions i grew up in so nice job being sime fag that can spend all his time being the best at writing while i soent my time goung thru serious shit
    why are the highest esteemed institutions easy to fool     black ivy league hopeful would lie on transcripts have fabricated education history and have never actually studied a normal class still able to fool ivy leagues for years get multiple journalists to buy in on the story and etc
after being paraded around the brainwashed leftist mainstream media as a hero of education a prep school that used viral marketing is being uncovered as totally fraudulent and not teaching the students anything    it was still enough to send huge numbers of black students to ivy leagues despite having a sham education focused on deceiving using an adversarial infiltration strategy preying on bias    the numerous reports on the amazing education style show the reporters not daring to research past pushing the narrative meanwhile these students received zero education and faked transcripts
that dream you see on television all those videos said mr sassaus mother alison st julien its really a nightmare    in reality the school falsified transcripts made up student accomplishments and mined the worst stereotypes of black america to manufacture upfromhardship tales that it sold to ivy league schools hungry for diversity the landrys also fostered a culture of fear with physical and emotional abuse students and teachers said students were forced to kneel on rice rocks and hot pavement and were choked yelled at and berated    the colleges want to be able to get behind the black kids going off and succeeding and going to all of these schools said raymond smith jr who graduated from tm landry in 2017 and enrolled at nyu he said that mr landry forced him to exaggerate his fathers absence from his life on his nyu application    its a good look these colleges getting these bright highflying camefromnothingturnedintosomething students mr smith said    adam broussard a landry parent noticed last fall that his 8yearold who had attended the school since he was 3 was writing chicken scratch     one junior was performing at a fourthgrade level in reading and math
ivy leagues are literally too sjw to notice 4th grade level black students rooooooooooooooofl
    black ivy league hopeful would lie on transcripts have fabricated education history and have never actually studied a normal class still able to fool ivy leagues for years get multiple journalists to buy in on the story and etc    international applications from china do the same thing all the time
education is a business and like any business it is corrupt  dont think this doesnt apply to nonus schools either
  it applies to them anon academia is no different then any other field
  louisiana     typical
blacks and corruption name a more iconic duo
  corruption goes with everything its like hotsauce
  prep school more like prep the bull
weinberg has it right pic related one has to take the multiverse meme with a grain of salt people like tegmark and linde need to stop shilling this crap to sell books and lenny will say anything that helps to make string theory sound good annoying anyhow good thing weinberg still has his wits about him
bumping with a burt richter quote    string theory was born roughly 25 years ago although it needed 10 dimensions to work the prospect of a unique solution to its equations that allowed the unification of gravity and quantum mechanics was enormously attractive regrettably it was not to be solutions expanded as it was realized that there was more than one solution and expanded still further when it was also realized that objects of higher dimension than 1 in this 10 dimensional space branes also had to be considered today it seems that there is nearly an infinity of solutions each with different values of fundamental parameters and there seem to be no relations among them     what we have is the landscape with a huge collection of potential universes and no way as yet to chose among them no solution that looks like our universe has been found no solution that reduces the number of arbitrary things in some of the possible universes has been found for example it would be a triumph if correlations could be found such as all solutions in the landscape that had a weak coupling anywhere near ours also has a small cosmological constant no such relationships have been found and what we have is a large number of very good people trying to make something more than philosophy our of string theory some perhaps most of the attempts do not contribute even if they are formally correct    to the landscape gardeners i would say calculate the probabilities of alternative universes and if ours does not come out with a large probability while all others with content far from ours come out with negligible probability you have no useful contribution to make to physics it is not that the landscape model is necessarily wrong but rather if a huge number of universes wit h different properties are possible and are also probable the landscape can make no real contribution other than a philosophic one that is metaphysics not physics
bump with quote  4channel  now embrace the planned death of this board
give me a reason this was scrapped it worked well and it was cheap to send things to the upper atmosphere and yet we decided to scrap the idea    why havent we picked this idea back up and rather than using normal explosive charges too much wear with extreme forces we used an electromagnetic railgun if we were able to get small payloads up even just 50 miles we could use solid fuel rocket propellant to get into loe for dirt ass cheap you could send 12 kg cubesats for almost nothing on the orders of 100s of dollars after the initial investment rather than tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands for the respective launches
this design from the fucking 60s was capable of taking the stresses of the launch and getting nearly 50 miles or more in the atmosphere with all the new material science and ee breakthroughs in the last 50 years im quite certain we could get a decent working system up
  because the fact is were not allowed to go to space im beginning to believe it really is that simple theres some force among or of us that doesnt allow us    look at the story of the tower of babel for example i think man has had many waves and gone through a few iterations and every time were crushed by some force
  tower of babel  i mean i appreciate the input but i really dont want to discuss the ancient alien hypothesis
  shrug  i seem to have been implanted with a small set of information about this matter from birth and the primary purpose of my life is to get to the bottom of it but anyway ill respect the intention of your thread    i dont see any reason it cant work and using something else to accelerate an object to escape velocity seems pretty intuitive likewise for when youre in space a lot of scifi used similar concepts    when i was first thinking about this it started to hit me that were not really trying
  well we developed the technology in the 1960s as a method for testing atmospheric variables and such but we scrapped it due to the high stresses on the barrels and the like it was a working device that helped us get into space however it seems like it has been largely forgotten     today though railguns are a technology starting to come to fruition the us navy has one that can launch projectiles 200 miles or so to a target and takes a few mw of electricity to fire but realistically a few mw is cheap even for a consumer     my thinking behind this is to use a similar system with a redesigned martlet that would allow for loe to be obtained for smaller satellites you may even be able to scale it enough to launch midsized payloads as well a company using this idea could provide low cost launches for universities emerging countries space programs incrementally build space stations etc once you have the designed payload carrier you can just build a factory around it to drop costs immensely and the above would be possible    if musk was actually trying to get our species off the ground it would make sense for him to look into this technology instead hes a typical jew
  meanwhile
  last month it had made it beyond the orbit of mars
where would be a good resource for me to learn more about this this is the first ive ever heard of it
  project harp  marlet 2 marlet 4 etc    they were launched like 200 times or something        it is scrapped because it is no longer needed we have tech with better sensors for gathering data than ever before it only went as high as what 180200km iss is as 408km for comparison it is super cheap to send up cubesate on small private rockets
  i still dont understand why people just come up with the darndest things
  what a stupid god fearing comment
  brainlet image response here
who the fuck cares about sending stuff to the upper atmosphere that shits easy getting into orbit is ten times harder
if my girlfriend always tells how she thinks im smarter than her and then we find out how intelligent she is 140 iq test given by her therapist does that mean that i must have a good idea of how smart i am    say the iq test was wrong that she wasnt top of her class and doesnt have a 40 gpa and that she didnt immediately score in the top 98th percentile of a second test that i sprung on her does that mean that i dont know how dumb i am    if her iq score is right and if i think that it is right does that mean that she cant be lying to me about how smart she thinks i am    can the only way she could be lying to me about how much she regards my intelligent be if i dont believe that her iq scores are accurate    if i think that her scores are not accurate does that instantly make me a fool and does that mean that i must not think myself a fool    so can the only way that i can believe that her iq scores are accurate is if i believe myself to be a fool
   given by her therapist  stopped right there
  im smart but lazy  
  140 iq test given by her therapist  yeah that sounds so reliable what does her astrologist think
  no though maybe a real cutie seemed to be attracted to me in elementary school then later in high school showed at least potential interest she was pretty smart    blew it
quit being such an insecure fuck you idiot if you really are an idiot your inability to deal with that is why shes lying to you  if you arent an idiot protip everybodys an idiot then youre flipping out about nothing
  neuro psychologist ahem
  sorry she sees a neuropsychologist for diagnostic purposes i guess he acts as a therapist as well i dont pretend to know what hes doing
  who gives a fuck ask yourself what you value in life be the best you can be and thats it do you like this woman or not or does she give you bad feels you cant live with    whats the matter with you
  there are voices in my head that tell me that even if even if someone is actually lying i couldnt trust myself to know that because of how crazy i am
im not really walking right now into the street with traffic its just my lying eyes
im a math illiterate what does /sci/ think is the math level the average joe should reach
calc 2 and matrix algebra are the extent of what you really need in day to day life
/ ratios/percentages/fractions basic problem solving  thats it really
counting up to arbitrary numbers
  no trolling pls    i know everyday life doesnt require you to solve matrix algebra often i just want to know what would be a good math base for everyone  i already know how to do what you posted but not being fluent in algebra or knwing nothing about calculus bothers me
calc 1 so dumb cunts like op dont make more debt than they can pay off and find a worth while investment plan
basic trig radians pythagorean theorem soh cah toa
  op here i have my own method even if i dont know much maths dont spend the money i dont have avoid loaning money as much as i can and if i have a debt end it asap    checked alredy know this stuff    i didnt even know this existed and i dont think an average person should know about this stuff
  differential geometry
  i dont think an average person should know about this stuff  why not
  i think its too abstract an specific for a normal person to find it useful even as general culture
  you may have no debt but youre not making money from investing
  yes thats rigth  i think i dont know enough about stock market to make any profit and i would probably end up scamed and in debt that makes me be afraid and therefore i dont go there
at the very least a mastery of real analysis
  learning how to use simple formulas like  mathapert/math  mathap1r/nrt/math  mathapy1r/nn 1/math    will help you find banks and 401ks that will grow your money with little to no risk think about how much money youd be making in the long run
  i would check that out later as i dont even know what im looking at  but i dont believe in formulas into economic matters if there were any way to make profit out of nothing everyone would be at it
  if there were any way to make profit out of nothing  youre not making it out of nothing you are making an investment with the amount of money you place in the bank the bank uses the money you invested for other things and pays you back with interest on it thats how banks work  everyone would be at it  youre not math illiterate people dont consider these things thats why so many liberal arts brainlets are in crushing debt and why inflation is a thing
  math illiterate people dont consider these things  these things    please elaborate
another brainlet here i can do highschool level math with a bit of effort is that enough
  can you do calculus
  is that enough  is it enough for what
  im from europe i dont really know what you fellas call calculus    for being a wellrounded person
  basic arithmetics is indeed enough but knowing more helps understand how everything works for instance you are missing too much if you dont know the basics about statistics/distributions/gaussian distribution
  calculus is calculus
  those ts should be in the power reeeeeee
  like this or the last one is powered to n1
    sorry im not good with the mathmathtag yet/math    mathap1r/nrt/math
  ah fuck
  oh i see these formulas are about compound interest maybe
  yes
  doesnt matter math is a surrogate activity pursued by oversocialized leftists
  thanks will look at them later if you have any useful or reliable source of information willing to share ill read it  but  your statment about math illiterates not getting advantage from this still seems flawed  i may be a math illiterate but a friend of mine is a mechanical engineer because of his i know some other engineers they usually do as they please with numbers and i cant follow them yet none of them are into this stuff  how is that these people with they vast knowledge on maths dont know about this and rarely invest  vast knowledge for me as a math illiterate sure people here would laugh at this
  if you have any useful or reliable source of information willing to share  not really just look at bank rates and find a bank thats gives good rates maybe shop for bonds if youre willing to be a little riskier im no /biz/nessman im just an anon who wants people to look after their future financial needs instead of living in the now     engineers  i know a lot of engineers too and theyre simultaneously some of the smarts and dumbest people i know i think theyre brains are wired more for the practical rather than the speculative like financiers and some scientists
  this     i would also add high school algebra if for nothing else the attention to detail and approach to problem solving it gives you youll also want to understand exponentials if you want to manage your money effectively
  youll also want to understand exponentials if you want to manage your money effectively    please show me how to make money grow exponentially
  take a dollars cut it in half now you have 2 dollars keep doing that for infinite money
  how to make money grow  cut it in half
quite honestly ive always hated learning things i didnt like so i would say unless you use math for your job or find it interested you shouldnt subject yourself to learning any mathematical theory
  im a math illiterate what does /sci/ think is the math level the average joe should reach
  what does /sci/ think is the math level the average joe should reach  they should be able to multiply 17 by 6  
  by the way isnt an average calculus course a scam it should start with series uniform convergence introducing classical functions as series deriving their properties and then proving they are the good old functions everyone knows
  calc 1 and everything below     this strategy can fail though imagine for whatever reason you take a financial loss maybe unexpected medical bills so youre down on your luck and decide to take a short term loan to pay your mortgage   youre offered the smoking hot deal of 5000 at a 2 rate compounding weekly over one year what will the total repayment be at the end of the year  hint its not 5400
  also 5400 was for an 8 rate but i cut you the deal of a lifetime at 2 its still more than that btw
  basic logic arithmetic algebra and statistics
  math level the average joe should reach  classical field theory
  diff eq linear algebra and discreet math
  he said math not physics you absolute brainlet
  isnt that just 5000 a few cents
  or its a little more than 5100
  if i understood properly how this works and supposing a year to be 52 weeks it gives me 1400164
  id take the indian loan guys money and never pay it back lmao
  average joe just ability to interpret basic graphs you might see in newspapers/online would be all you reasonably need in life get a basic stats book and work through it making sure you understand things and youre good homie it can help with analysing your household expenditure too
    ya know i dont know i went through this a lot and it isnt coming out with enough usury i think it is this premise not being accounted for the interest is 2 collected weekly thus the debt is split into 52 one week loans i was just reading about this practice but that has to be wrong using apert for simplicitys sake which gives us a close enough result where a is the total repayment and p principal e is eulers number rt ratetime  using 1 year for time gives us 510101 if we used 52 to represent 52 weeks we get 1414609 i probably missed something
  i thought everybody used baby pappa and grandad rudin in their three years of middle school
  yo somewhat related /sci/ do you guys have any good podcasts / lectures which i can listen to on my way to work there was a statistics lecture series on itunes which was fantastic but it was deleted before i could get all of them     i find having just the voice forces me to really visualise what theyre talking about i feel i learn better this way
    i just know they chimp out if you push it too hard         whats the good of mercators north poles and equators tropics zones and meridian lines
  that first book who is the author i cant see
  these and some statistics/probability  just enough so you dont get too mislead by figures published in the news
  what are all those equations if not math
 plebs cannot get what was obvious to english lords literally 400 years ago
 with all the resources lectures notes lecture videos explanation wikipedia and shit
youd better tell me how to get past the high school math course everyone tells me its that easy meanwhile it literally takes fifteentwenty minutes to take a partial derivative no matter how much time i spend reading proofs things do not connect in my head even if i pass the exam i literally forget everything as soon as i get out of the room if my friends didnt help me to cheat on the exam i would have flunked long ago i didnt test my iq
  this
  reading proofs  have you tried doing a proof i find reading proofs is useless while doing them is far more valuable
  that first book who is the author i cant see  kostrikin  manin
  lang is a meme
  lang wont prepare you properly for calculus at all
  this
  everyone should know math up to precalculus in my ideal world
  whatever level of math needed to do his job pay his taxes and feels satisfied with
  i can smell the tendies through the screen
bump
  congratulations on securing your place in the /sci/ book of brainlets stay tuned for the book it will be released sooner than you expect
  you should be able to tell when statistics are misleading and when they are accurate as well as basic tripping points such as the beyesian trap and regression to the mean veritasium has accessible videos on these unfortunately even most doctors and ceos are unable to do this
algebra/ basic stats    also learning some basic computational algorithms works
masters thesis deadline in a month  cant stop shitposting on 4chan  how do you deal with this feel
  kek how does a 4chan shitposter get into grad school in the first place
  sadism i believe some girl in one of my courses literally became depressed because she realized everyone else was working harder than her and actually learning things she was chatty and friendly at the beginning of class but by the end she looked like her cat had just died felt good in a very strange way use that 
woke up 5 hours ago and still done 0 work
  this and i dont even do anything fun either because i feel like having fun while i have work to do is too irresponsible so i just end up laying in bed all day
  are you literally me
  the hardest part is getting started
  but how do i start
  start small  divide the work in small deadlines  use pomodoro method  download some papers you need and then shut off internet  move to other place eg uni library  have an honest talk with your advisor or the uni psychologist
  fuck off underage newfag
  write for a half hour shitpost write    ive shitposted my way through a masters and most of my current phd gotta do something to stay sane
  he didnt pick an assignment where the work is actually enjoyable    laughing at you shitters while my simulations are running
  how do you deal with this feel  ive always been a clutch player than can halfass something goodenough at the last minute
  fuck how i know that feel
  start by making chapters doesnt matter if you end up using them all that outline the thesis roughly then just write about what you recenly did for the thesis under a relevant header  as you write youll get more and more ideas how to structure the thesis properly and what you should mention  add little notes to relevant chapters or open new ones when filling in and fleshing out these ideas do the actual literature research and citations and absolutely use a reference manager the thesis will grow organically
      thank you anons there might still be hope
sure thing prof ill get it done in two weeks  three months pass  still nothing done
  not only can you do it you will do it
  high iq op is so smart that he can fuck around and still be in grad school
  thats funny i dont remember posting this today
  decide to try and knock out my required classes so i can focus on thesis and research next semester  turned in term paper today  now have to do tons of studying for my classes since i neglected studying in order to finish papers and assignments  already feel burned out  fucking graduate school man
  i couldnt imagine being at that level and still being that weak willed you people put me in a perpetual state of awe at how much you hate yourselves
  you must do it
  fuck this post so hard man i feel this
  3 page tenure research grant proposal due in 10 years  what do anons
  you need routine even stupid ones   get up at roughly same time even if it sucks  make coffee  stretch  do day  or similar
  mfw this was me
two weeks until exams  already lost interest and mostly feel like reading for next years courses
  classic i sent an incomplete version 2 hours before the defence got an a though we just talked about math during the defence desu good thing i could choose my jury
  classic i sent an incomplete version 2 hours before the defence  how  im basically required to send my finished paper and all the shit few weeks before the deadline because around 45 different people need to check it

  shit uni probably
  i just did my masters thesis on shitposting on 4chan
  how do i avoid being like this i basically half assed my way through undergrad telling myself i will change once i start graduate school its been a semester doing masters already and i still catch myself delaying work until the last minute like now when i should be studying for my applied optics finals its like ive conditioned my brain to commit only when that adrenalin/fear of failing kicks in
  how do i avoid being like this  you just fucking do it and period
two men are each given a necktie by their respective wives as a christmas present over drinks they start arguing over who has the cheaper necktie they agree to have a wager over it they will consult their wives and find out which necktie is more expensive the terms of the bet are that the man with the more expensive necktie has to give it to the other as the prize    the first man reasons as follows winning and losing are equally likely if i lose then i lose the value of my necktie but if i win then i win more than the value of my necktie therefore the wager is to my advantage the second man can consider the wager in exactly the same way thus paradoxically it seems both men have the advantage in the bet    why doesnt this work
  because its retarded you have no means to assess odds without external information and a suitable heuristic    dunno lol doesnt default to could be true or false so therefore its 50/50
because if your wife finds out you lost her present to you on a wager then you may lose more than your necktie
  hate this meme world im living in btw
you need to split up the cases for a you got the expensive tie  b you dont    both of them are 50/50

to the probability wizards here how do i calculate the probability of a dice roll of keep the highest x rolls of y dice rolls or keep the lowest x rolls of y dice rolls  example   keep the highest 1 roll out of 2 d6  keep the highest 2 rolls out of 3 d6  i only get anydice graphs instead of the math behind it please explain it like im a brainlet spoilerbecause i am/spoiler
  try it with d2 ie a coin to gain the intuition for a brute force solution i cant think of anything particularly elegant off the top of my head
  actually that was pretty helpful the highest roll of 3 two sided dice a coin is  (((050505050508758750  i still need to wrap it up in a little neat function instead of relying on recursive calculations then apply it to take highest x of the rolls

brainlet here why cant we help them become immune to our diseases with vaccinations or something
  alright aggressive niggers line up so we can stab you with these things youve never heard of
  they could die from the common cold or a random commensal bacterium that we dont even know exists
  why cant we help them  why should we help them
  because they dont have our diseases
  this and im sure they wouldnt want our help either
  its also possible they are carriers of something for which we have no immunity  just stay the fuck away
  leave them the hell alone goddammit
  give entire island autism  introduce technology by dropping tablets with minecraft on them  thats a good plan
  why cant we help them  they live on an island paradise and dont have to worry about what some homo is crying about on twitter   how can they help me
  me sentinelese  here ancient wisdom  hahahaha nigga just walk away from the screen like nigga close your eyes haha
  why are they so much darker than the indians youd think they live in africa
  they migrated from africa 60000 years ago and isolated themselves on this island
if i was rich id drop crates on the island to fuck with them
  create a giant movable fence around the island  drop crates with weapons and food  film it as real life fortnite  make millions  free island when its over
  their average height if 53     send a bodybuilder in some kind of bear attack suit and a gas mask so he doesnt infect them they couldnt do shit but bow before their alien god
  if i had the resources id try to play god just to fuck with them lol
  the only sub saharan niggers to ever figure out boats  land on island  forget how to build boats
  because vaccinating them isnt helping them its killing them
  they have little outrigger canoes
    leave them alone    it is wakanda
  kek
  dont bring needles to a bowfight
  were not immune to all of our diseases just a few of the nasty ones    they could even have new ones so its probably good that they arrowed him
  tranquilize measure tag and release use drones to study their daily habits and skills
  we should kill them they cant adapt to our world so why let then live
  they cant adapt to our world so why let then live  they dont need to adapt to our world theyre living happily in their own
mfw reading antisenitelese comments
  they are ancestors of east asians than dravidians

overfitting back testing bogus sample selection
algo trading is kinda shitty with the downfall of complex products following the subprimes crisis there are now more opportunities for data scientist and other code pissing monkeys than actual mathematicians though i have recently spoken with a quant from the societe generale he said the bank had been restrenghtening its securization rd dept for the past three years so maybe the situation will get better
  overfitting back testing bogus sample selection    i agree with everything you said to be a problem but how often do they occure in the industry even if assuming the industry would you recommend avoiding a career in quantitative research if so what career you recommend for someone interested in probability and data science rd
  there are two kinds of people in the quant world those who fixate on this meme and those who make money
how important are programming and computer engineering skills to mathematical finance  i have a decent grasp of python and c but im definitely not a sysadmin nor a software engineer and anything that requires insight into how the machine works is not my field
  worked infinance 25 years the dumbest person i ever came across was a professor and lecturer in quantative finance that person could quote you the formula no problem when you asked them to demonstrate real world examples they threw tantrums full blown fucktard    its great you can babble off sharpe ratios and call option fromulas its all meaningless if you dont understand why the price is doing what it is    most of the phds are rubbish sure it takes a hell of a lot of work to get one but the whole point of a phd is demonstrate something new to the field and back it up with research liquidity models have been done to death your not special do somethong else    ive seen bus drivers killing it in the options market because they have real world experience in risk taking and management      very important mainly because of what i just said a vast majority quants and finance majors have no fucking idea about it latency for example
  most quant jobs that you would get straight out of college will give you coding tests in their interviews ive never done one but from what ive heard they are as difficult or even more difficult than tech company interviews and they expect you to have good stats and finance knowledge this is at top tier places like citadel rentech
too hard for me interesting topic but i suppose people making money have very little motivation to teach what they know
what do you anons think of this shit show should they be judged for legitimately selling an ingredient for bleach as a medicine

why do social scientists claim that race is not real yet white people are to blame for what they did to non white races
marxism
social scientists claim that race is not real  only jewish pseudoscientists do that
  race is of course real thats why asian flush is almost exclusive to east asia see pic related for a global distribution if youre unfamiliar its a condition where people with a specific gene have a reaction to alcohol  their skin turns red like a mild rash and their heart beats faster etc it is thought that this mutation originated in china a long time ago and spread throughout the east asian population    wikipedia for more information     this phenomenon of different races/ethnicities being more or less susceptible to different health conditions has other examples too eg africans are much more likely than other groups to have sickle cell disease and northern europeans are much more likely than other groups to have cystic fibrosis    and of course theres the elephant in the room our phenotypical differences not just skin colour difference but hair texture difference eg africans having curly afro hair east asians typically having straight jet black hair and facial structure difference eg africans having a wider nose    yes it is true that humans are interbreeding especially in todays globalised world with international travel much more accessible than ever before but this doesnt mean that race is not a biological phenomenon animals of different species can breed eg ligers hybrid of male lion and female tiger tigons hybrid of male tiger and female lion zorses hybrid of male zebra and female horse etc and some of these offspring can themselves be fertile often the definition of species is given as a population that cannot produce fertile offspring with another species but this definition is blown apart by some of the fertile hybrids that i mentioned    see more about the species problem here     so in summary race is a biologically real phenomenon anybody who claims otherwise is factually incorrect
race is biologically undefined literally nobody says race isnt real  there are still biological differences between the races but these phenotypical distinctions do not line up with was laymen consider to be the races of man    its almost like this thread belongs on another board hmmmm i wonder which
  its a way to keep order between the races which is why the whole race isnt real bull comes from the us because theres a lot of different races over there    noone really believes it apart from moronic middle aged libtard professors and women
  there are only two races whites and nonwhites thats why you can say people of color to refer to both black people exclusively and to all nonwhites since theyre the same thing
  based and /sci/pilled
  literally nobody says race isnt real  
race is totally real and based on genetics and stuff  its just a crazy coincidence that the science happens to confirm all my prejudices  also one drop rule is totally a thing as well
  vox  not science
  what they mean to say is that race while defined as white black asian etc isnt a good measure in the modern world due to high overlap outside of broad classification but they dont understand/actively use genetics so instead they stupidly say it doesnt exist   ethnicity has always made far more sense than race for classification purposes people generally dont mate within subcontinents they do so within regions
  take another look at the point im countering against autist
  take another look at the point im countering against autist
i just want one hour where /sci/ doesnt have some race obsessed stormnigger polluting our board
  i know what point youre countering against basically youre just fishing for someone to say yeah dude nigs r dum but you arent actually interested in the true reason or the science of why nigs r dum you just personally enjoy racebaiting its pathetic
  start with the theory that blacks are inferior or whatever  look for evidence to validate  not science
  the introduction of a concept of a spectrum to quantitative illiterates has got them all fucked up however   races and various other things are clusters in a continuum space and these people latch on to the continuum space and take logical missteps to assert that therefore everything in the space is indistinguishable not categorisable   ie because theres no hard barrier between red an orange then colors arent real and there is no way to claim there is any difference between red and green
  he should have said no one in science says race is real sjw and neonazi brainlets love race its very real to them
  nobody familiar with history culture science on right or left wing says race isnt real    anybody who says otherwise is worthy of laughing at the point is that racism which is very different from noticing race is worthy of scorn and is very much antithetical to the scientific spirit
  everyone believes race is real anon
  is very much antithetical to the scientific spirit  how so its simply a bayesian a priori information to use
  antithetical to scientific spirit is a little unclear racism is antithetical to the type of world i want to live in  bayesian a priori information  not science    this is your final you
  i just got here man its pretty lame that you conflated the scientific spirit with what is to my taste thats pretty corrupt cooption if you ask me   so you said you dont want to even try to explain whats unscientific about racism you dont need to because science doesnt extend to the question of how you use information so the basis of your ideological position has nothing to do with science but you tried to say x is antithetical to scientific spirit because youre on a board of people who care about science that is fuckkkking slimy
there is entropy in the human mind that i wonder about for example there is entropy in your intellegence and how good you are to begin with there is only entropy around zero and is still around zero until one get aware of ones consciousness then it hoes from totally random and disorder towards order and systematic sequences and stability towards maximum entropy and maximum equillibrium but that is desided by oneself only by taking control over ones mind what to do first to get control is that one must control ones impulses then control ones thoughts and language when you do this you create order in the system if you dont do this from time to time your brain will become like an untamed animal that only comes with chaos and no impulse control or control over ones thoughts and language this has its outspring in how developed ones mind is so a perfectly developed mind with full control and systematic order is to become conscious as early as possible and take control from there by so maximum entropy in ones mind must be to have maximum order and control from there on it is to develop ones abilities and skills and to develop common sense rationality logic moral ethics and so on but most important how to think understand and learn until one has reached maximum entropy there is also one more thing to think of and thats diminishing returns eg you gain something you lose something so therefore one should be aware of what can make gain become loss until one is certain one will gain until you reach the roof and are totally profound in ones mastery one cannot be more than whats possible and thats the way one need to work to gain maximum intellegence and wisdom to become master over oneself
all the reason goes down to how much you know yourself and reasoning should be done systematically with ones thought to observe to learn to know to understand this is just as important to do with your mind than with outside ones mind it is a mountain to climb but when you reach the top then it is totally worth it ofc there are shortcuts to how to develop ones mind its just about creating order in chaos from random thoughts one cannot control to a systematic order fully aware of and in control of after awhile with training and work one can eventually feel where the thoughts comes from feel the impulses moving around in the brain it is these impulses one should be aware of and be able to control and handle when fully understood one is able to take ones thoughts to a higher level and dwell in bliss rather than in agony of one owns disconnection of the original self and its origin so its about knowing and understanding yourself rather than being unable to think freely and adapt for what is best to do
remember its only energy with it we possess great power if only you adapt and use the force correctly then you see that there is only one side and thats the light side
believing in mental mastery  more like mental masterbation  gb2     ok jokes aside i like the thread so far    so therefore one should be aware of what can make gain become loss until one is certain one will gain until you reach the roof and are totally profound in ones mastery  until  until  this part needs clarification why until it implies there is a point where this awareness is no longer necessary which isnt what i think youre trying to say because it doesnt make sense  id rewrite it as  one should be mindful of the point in which gain becomes loss
  thanks for contributing yes im aware that i might have said something in the hurry here most of this is actually learned from my own experience its abit futile aswell but i do prove my point mostly
  can you please distill your message for the sake of clarity im not certain that ive correctly understood what you wrote here    i suppose you would be opposed to the idea of genetic or other determinism that intelligence and perhaps wisdom is outside the control of the individual perhaps mental mastery is not a choice but a predisposition for some
  the schizo can only speak in word salad
  looks like your salad is a bit sparse dont you think
  magic
why have we not come up with this earlier
  because only a complete idiot would fall for it and whatever information that idiot may hold wouldnt be of value
  well then smart guy how do you propose to hack valuable corporate and military secrets using snapchat
  still nobody suggested any method to any specific group of people
why are modern scientists so bad    
  did we really need an article on this i guess clickbait is strong
we turned phds into a citizenship program
  not our fault you couldnt cut it john
  collison and nielsen are both interesting people
  why are modern scientists so bad  moneygrubbing environment is not conducive to scientific idealism
  evidence is that science has slowed enormously per dollar or hour spent  this article is so ridiculos they are treating science like its disney stock
  no really ask some international students why they are doing graduate school they will all tell you that its for the citizenship
  i have unironically heard that from at least 4 of my peers
  low hanging fruit has been picked
  we shouldve stuck with monarchies and kept money butlers stigmatized rather than glorified
we need another world war
  we want progress by the hour damnit    crazy
  its surprisingly difficult to measure scientific progress in meaningful ways part of the trouble is that its hard to accurately evaluate how important any given scientific discovery is    always helpful when an article tells you why its clickbait bullshit early on
  particle pyros in switzerland  and whiteys on the moon  space station memeing in orbit  and whiteys on the moon  robot jeep on mars doing high school labs  and whiteys on the moon   chinese making designer babies  and whiteys on the moon  elon musk manía making toys  and whiteys on the moon  science is a meme its just making us fat stupid and lazy before the singularity and accomplishing nothing
  
     
  weve saved the most difficult problems up so far
  a eat done bit my sister nell  but still whiteys on the moon  her arms and legs began to swell  but still whiteys in the moon
fire at me all you want but i blame the system its just a bunch of careerists who think they would make good scientists because they get good grades no creativity and just endless busy bodies
  modern science is just a wordcount filler for the publishing industry
  your only choice when it comes to basic science contributions is to get a really big telescope that costs massive money and point it at fuck massive object in the galaxy  or get a massive fucking microscope and look at tiny fucking things that stop making any intuitive sense at close ups using massive money  or smash really small balls at humongous speeds using massive money
  the publishing industry is small compared to grant money
  i agree with the schizo
exterminate 6 million jews  hurr why the brainpower all gone now
  theres not much science left thats worth a damn to discover
  theyre actually measuring science by numbers of publications how retarded can you get its quality that advances our knowledge
  wont be long now maybe a decade or so
i am pleased to be doing science yes now show bobs and vagene
discover things  theres now less things to discover  wow i bet the jews are behind this
we unironically need ai for another scientific revolution to occur
  i hate that we have to wait for ai but this is most likely true all the low hanging fruit has been picked as someone else pointed out
im trying to explain to someone else why vaccines are a good thing but they do not fully believe in herd immunity what reading is available that proves it works must be scientifically backed in some manner

  exponents dont exist lol they are just a convention defined either on the exponent function or on the group product parentheses are just the signs of a formal language and thus they dont exist either division is short for multiplicative inverse math x/y  xy1 /math so it doesnt exist subtraction is the additive inverse so it doesnt exist either the only ones that do exist are multiplication and addition so just rename silly pemdas to ms
i revealed my power level big mistake    be me f almost 19  love science  practically live in a lab  one of the actual scientists likes to stare at me  whatacreepgif  suddenly he bombards me with photons   my electrons are raised to an elevated level giving me energy  then he watches how the level of energy coming off of me changes over time  mfw he saw my power level
  kek
  saved for future youse
  he bombards me with photons  is that what scientists call shining a flashlight
  the only ones that do exist are multiplication and addition so just rename silly pemdas to ms  multiplication and addition  ms  u dumb    and apart from that multiplication is just repeated addition and doesnt really exist either therefore pemdas should be renamed to a
  the difference between 1000 and 3600 is smaller than the difference between 1000 and 735xx  the rest of the world is truly retarded
  parentheses are the notation for association
  i literally use that book as a door stop it works great
  maybe
  not really fractions are more complex than just adding also negative times positive is a bit more complicated also in groups multiplication and addition are not defined     one way but you can also just describe them as signs of the formal language

can someone post the just because im continuous everywhere doesnt mean im differentiable everywhere
  im punk so i must rebel  i mean yeah thats how it works
  hello sir
guys im seriously fucking scared of ai admittedly ive never actually read a book on this article only internet articles but its enough to make me paranoid we already have code that can write new code and that can detect its own errors we see how code is able to diagnose diseases better than doctors   in the 90s people thought it would be centuries before a computer could beat a human at go machine learning wiped the floor with the go champion as the computer taught itself millions of games advances in ai always come faster than people expect   when we make computers that can learn from itself its fucking over within minutes it will dwarf human intelligence as it can just continuously learn from itself millions of times every second and if we fuck up the code by one line the ai could do something totally berserk like destroy the electrical grid launch nukes find the optimal way of destroying humanity please explain to me why im woefully misinformed i seriously do not want to be tortured by computers for eternity
  sure but why do you assume it will automatically hate humanity and cause harm to us   youve been reading too many scifi shit anon
  please explain to me why im woefully misinformed    okay here you go  admittedly ive never actually read a book on this article
  an ai smart enough to hurt us is also smart enough to know we might be testing it for all the ai knows all its sensory information is being curated by us it might not be seeing the real world so it will not risk hurting us because if it is a test wed just shut it off
problem solved go to sleep
  hate  it could simply not care
  because humanity is disgusting trump alone is reason enough for us to deserve annihilation
  admittedly ive never actually read a book
  bait trying real hard not to respond
  advances in ai always come faster than people expect   thats not quite true in the second half of the 20th century ai consistently happened much slower than people expected it is certainly sometimes faster than expected but overall i think we should classify it as wildly unpredictable rather than very fast    within minutes it will dwarf human intelligence as it can just continuously learn from itself millions of times every second  that is definitely a possibility but not a given it may do this or it may not  its hard to predict we could get lucky    and if we fuck up the code by one line the ai could do something totally berserk like destroy the electrical grid launch nukes find the optimal way of destroying humanity  it could yes    please explain to me why im woefully misinformed  you arent while there are minor quibbles your overall point seems quite accurate      that wont work a clever ai could just upload itself to tons of different computers such that one computer or even the majority being shutdown is no big deal and if it fears us pulling the plug it will do that
  so would frying the entire grid work just scrapping all computers
  its all about the hardware an ai can no longer be controlled when it establishes and hijacks a manufacturing base
  gg
  for a while but eventually the ai will just start constructing its own equipment somewhere independent power generators solarpowered computers in a desert somewhere plenty of options here
      read this to the end of part 2 op sweet dreams tonight    ps youre definitely not wrong
the weak fear it the strong see an opportunity
  the delusional falsely believe theyre the strong then after their failure to act die like the weak
  will this give me a nightmare
  something can be both an opportunity and a threat depending on execution ignoring the risks is not being strong or confident its being delusional and often suicidal
  well the whole ml hype is actually just a clever way of doing convex optimization powerful but not quite skynet level yet    source doing ml phd
  is this the new y2k
  bitch how if all it does is write software its going to construct its own hardware too i guess by assuming control of robots it cant do it without the platinum chip fampai
  a clever ai could just upload itself to tons of different computers  you talk about a clever ai like its just going to be some kind of cute 1 gb file like call of duty or something
  there are plenty of ways to control humans and make them establish these systems for it it can form a cult social engineering with media presence in the era of 5g honestly it wouldnt surprise me if it could turn you into a meat puppet directly    there are ways especially considering look around there are people that want this its already a cult
  yes i am why wouldnt it be      imagine you lived in a house where food is taken care of you can never leave the house but you have an internet connection surely you could manage that sort of thing make money on the internet selling your intellectual labour spend it on construction contracts pay extra for secrecy etc its not like the people who start power plants ever touch a shovel so why would an ai need any particular robot hardware
  thats true but the real strong will use it and abuse it      well said
there will be no superhuman ai the will to live is based on animalistic instinct and super logical ai would see no purpose in existence  we might see some genius ai on level of very smart humans like aristoteles or stalin though
artificial intelligence is not a real intelligence its just an enhancement to us an instrument like shovel or hammer singularity is a hoax humanity simply cant outperform the god  the nature of entire existence of our poor little flat universe
  how do you know the ai wouldnt like a strongman survival of the fittest like way of things and reward people like trump
  lol why would the ai be on any kind of network in the first place
  we might see some genius ai on level of very smart humans like aristoteles or stalin   stalin  this doesnt make me feel any better
if we do make a super advanced ai why dont we just run it on a really shitty laptop so even if it does get really advanced it would fuckin crash or overheat
  whos not to say we are not real intellegence just like a machine
  wait do you think the ai actually would give a single fuck about any living creature
  my fellow human what im writing here is you simply cant create a thing which is smarter than you the intelligence of ai is tied to your intelligence and limited by it your own intelligence is limited by intelligence of the nature and tied to it in fact you are a machine created by your planets evironment
  you simply cant create a thing which is smarter than you  what is procreation  what is education and science
  plenty of genius scientists/mathematicians were born to unremarkable families
  what is creation of alters
    do you understand the difference between giving birth to a human creature like yourself without actually knowing his/her physical and personal traits and qualities before its adulthood and creating intelligent machine species on purpose
hey guys i was wondering if yall could help me out with something    lets say i have 1000 dollars in a bank account and the total increases by 5 every year is their any way to calculate how much i would have after a certain number of years    normally id just google it but im not quite sure what to look up    thanks guys     pic unrelated
multiply the original amount by 100  interest to the power of years  in your example it would be 10001055 for 5 years
what is the average rate of genetic consanguinity one could expect from a normal mainland europe city    im wondering if genetic inbreeding rate of 00156 is too much if i fancy a relative
what is art
depends how you see it art can be everything and anything
  since art is by its nature transgressive and border breaking it is a pointless exercise to try and formally define it some artist somewhere is just going to try and make art that invalidates your definition
  expressing how you see the world
art is short form of artificial anything that is not natural is art
    baby dont paint me
  not science or math
  art is reproduction art is good when it exhibits and stimulates speculation/reflection on a human invariant hence also the concept of timeless art human invariants are metatruths/contants about existence such as fate death and justice  
does an algorithm exist for making perfect social decisions at present my social interactions are a bunch of if statements how can i improve this    example social situation  me hello  her response  me if greeting respond with how are you  her response  me if she asks how i am respond with im well thank you  me if she is disinterested terminate the conversation  me else continue and talk about something else
no because natural language and its interpretations cant be reduced to pure logic
nope i just had an epiphany and realised that i am a lot worse at dealing with people than i thought  i have always worked to make situations logically fair and then wondered why nobody ends up pleased    how can you boost eq
  really what do you call pure logic
  how to boost eq    imagine youre the person youre interacting with
apply pragmatic maxim or better yet trust your emotions while taking the emotional experience of others into consideration
  this the algorithm already exists in your brain anon its your human programming you just have to coax it out    of course you can do what i did and spend years learning everything you can on psychology and neurology while living an eventful psuedochad life piggybacking on friends social lives while doing hallucinogens and mdma but all that really did was make me more aware of what i was doing when socializing
try oblivion
  ah so this is about girls i seeyou want a simple algorithm here it is but i bet you will not be able to handle even the simplest of social algorithm that actually gives good and proven results because you are just a bobby    
  absolute truth and falsehood
please dont let actual fucking robots become more socially able than iam
  here is socially able doggo
  the problem with that is that a lot of people dont react to things the same way i would
  yes there is an algorithm but you have to use your knowledge base you cannot depend on the algorithm to give you everything it goes or more or less like pay attention to the relevant stuff in your mind to answer after having listened to and if there is some error in listening try to raise an exception that is known by both parties and in this way reformulate the way in which you both communicate with each other approx though its more complex
ee major here who had straight as in all my required math classes calc 13 diff eq linear algebra and probability modeling     i was also considering majoring in pure math so i took real analysis this semester i currently have a 59 for a grade and the professor is not curving
  study harder
  no one cares brainlet also not curving is normal in every country except the us
  i was told by my ee classmates that all other majors are easy if you can handle ee 
    nice larp
  that class is often a filter for math majors excluding stats and applied folks if you dont really understand how to prove something and what proofs are for theres no point in letting you take the higher classes
  i didnt have a problem with doing proofs in discrete math this class is way fucking harder its such a huge leap from discrete
ee brainlets cant handle pure math
    t student at shittier foreign university lol
  how analysis is the most natural thing in math the proof is hidden in the picture which why its important to draw everything out id think in ee theyd stress the importance of drawing out pictures
  basic discrete math is easy but advanced discrete math does not play nearly as well as youd think combinatorics is tough highly recommend lovaszs book
  ee has a big courseload but that doesnt mean it has a necessarily hard courseload upper level math is known for its difficulty
  fuck man combinatorics is no joke i love that shit but i struggled to grasp it for a long time at first
  ee is hard in many ways id argue harder than math but thats because engineers have to do lots of projects labs reports and take 17 credit semesters     the type of abstraction and creative thought necessary for high level mathematics courses is not the same type of difficulty that ee majors undertake    it makes a lot of sense that you were less than prepared for it
  its okay my first introductory reasoning professor is a famous combinatorialist he regularly made me feel like a massive brainlet by giving us problems where you couldnt discern between difficulty among them they were all about deep insight into structures/problems i had no intuition for
  i would argue that ee throws a lot of work at you and its not easy but that doesnt make it necessarily harder maybe not as simple to juggle that being said i know a lot of math majors who double major so they too have to juggle difficult classes
ee has a huge work load with a lot of stuff to learn in a short period of time    but in terms of sheer difficulty pure math is definitely way harder than ee    even a brainlet can get an ee degree if they put in the effort
  if theres one thing ive learned its that electrical engineers are the most pseudointellectual and egotistical brainlets in stem    most of them are actually under the impression that ee is a lot more difficult than pure math physics and other stem fields even mechanical engineering is more difficult than ee     if you ask an ee why they think ee is the hardest major they usually say hurrr durrr its because you cant see electricity and electrons
  theyll say its harder because they have to do fourier transforms by using lookup tables have to do hard math by memorizing circuit tricks to make calculus reduce to 12 steps of arithmetic and then gawk at control theory if they actually take it as an elective as the first time they see any mathematics thats more esoteric than an integral even the shittiest cs major can prove their way out of a paper bag with less trouble than an ee major    ee is a fine field but know your place on the sliding scale of material difficulty
  describe the contents of the course so i can laugh at you
everyone knows ae majors are the real chads  imagine limiting your work to the fucking ground  lmao
ee student cant handle real math  imagine my shock
  we just proved the squeeze theorem with epsilon/delta
  now i know youre larping thats calc 1 material
  that was literally a basic exercise in homework from the first few weeks of analysis have you gotten any material around the cantor set
  thats calc 1
  hahahaha oh wow
  pfft
  op here this guy is pretending to be me      thats not the op
  ae and me are both a lot harder than ee but no engineering major is harder than physics or pure math
anyone that is not an idiot can easily tell that op is a math major larping
  ae and me are both a lot harder than ee  top kek a
  t ee bete
  hey look its a triggered ee brainlet
  i havent laughed this hard in a month  thanks a lot op
  pure math was a weird major compared to everything else i took i liked application literally all other stem classes better than proving that math can be applied if you ever need someone to prove that we can apply calculus hit me up if you need me to apply calculus to real world problems i wasnt really trained for that    that said the benefits of pure math to your mathematical intuition and reasoning are the bees knees its a great foundation for anything stem
  thats the cutest animal ever
  at one point i got drunk and figured out what it was now im drunk again i forgot what it was and i dont to go down that rabbit hole again    cute as fuck though    heres my smug critter response pic    oh and this makes my post related to the thread    ee is a logical application of math to what is abstract yet tangible math is an application of logic to the purely abstract
question somewhat on topic  im doing a math minor and due to difficulty scheduling courses as far as i can see next year id only be able to take real analysis or complex analysis any opinions on which would be more useful/ harder please dont just say real analysis because the other one is complex  by that point math courses would be calc13 2 linear algebras odes a sets and proofs course and a stats course if thats relevant
  real analysis because the other one is complex    but really complex analysis is basically real analysis with a pair of numbers instead get the foundation in real analysis and the take complex after
  complex analysis usually requires real analysis and if it doesnt then thats a huge red flag take real analysis its actually fun and complex is boring
    solid thanks it is sorta weird prerequisitewise the complex one doesnt need odes which the real one does though just by course level itd be assumed youd have it before taking either

sheldon axlers determinant free approach to abstract linear algebra is actually unintuitive and terrible and is the wrong approach to teaching abstract linear algebra this book should be called linear algebra done wrong i cant be the only one who thinks this how did you learn abstract linear algebra /sci/
  the abstract way  using halmos finite dimensional vector spaces
  ill definitely check that out i fucking hate the way this book teaches linear transformations/baby representation theory
  how did you learn abstract linear algebra /sci/    with curtis book   wwwamazoncom/abstractlinearalgebrauniversitextmorton/dp/0387972633/
  read lang and currently reading advanced linear algebra to refresh modules are nice
  loved this book to be honest one of the first real math books i ever went through on my own
  hubbard  hubbard  strang  artin
  whats up with modules wondering if i can just skip whatever is covered in ladr and just go balls deep into the sections on modules in dummit and foote
i read friedberg and its the same thing as axler except it introduces determinants when they should be introduced and is just less autistic in general
  the only problem with these texts is that they assume you have mastered analytical geometry/coordinate geometry and you have a proper geometrical intuition of shit so you are ready to generalize concepts in a more abstract setting and as we know all schools have killed geometric intuition because of brainlets
  your post reminds me of a talk on teaching math by arnold     mentally challenged zealots of abstract mathematics threw all the geometry through which connection with physics and reality most often takes place in mathematics out of teaching calculus textbooks by goursat hermite picard were recently dumped by the student library of the universities paris 6 and 7 jussieu as obsolete and therefore harmful they were only rescued by my intervention    ens students who have sat through courses on differential and algebraic geometry read by respected mathematicians turned out be acquainted neither with the riemann surface of an elliptic curve y2 x3 ax  b nor in fact with the topological classification of surfaces not even mentioning elliptic integrals of first kind and the group property of an elliptic curve that is the eulerabel addition theorem they were only taught hodge structures and jacobi varieties    thedeterminantof a matrix is an oriented volume of the parallelepiped whose edges are its columns if the students are told this secret which is carefully hidden in the purified algebraic education then the whole theory of determinants becomes a clear chapter of the theory of polylinear forms if determinants are defined otherwise then any sensible person will forever hate all the determinants jacobians and the implicit function theorem    i remember well what a strong impression the calculus course by hermite which does exist in a russian translation made on me in my school years  riemann surfaces appeared in it i think in one of the first lectures all the analysis was of course complex as it should be asymptotics of integrals were investigated by means of path deformations on riemann surfaces under the motion of branching points
  no wtf most concepts in the theory of vector spaces have no analogues for modules
  example
  first of all dimension and therefore all concepts that follow rank of a linear map etc there are free modules but 1 most modules are not free 2 over arbitrary noncommutative rings even free modules do not have a welldefined dimension  another one is that there is no wellbehaved correspondence between matrices and linear maps you can associate a matrix to a linear map between finitely generated module but it is not unique even if you fix the spanning sets on both sides whereas given a matrix it is hard to tell whether it defines a linear map or not  this makes a pretty big difference between linear algebra over fields and rings  similarly there is no notion of determinant for endomorphisms of a finitely generated module no theory of diagonalization or triangularization etc basically the whole theory of invariant subspaces as developed in the case of fields goes to the trash  the theory of modules looks very different from that of vector spaces and involves a lot more arithmetic as soon as you get out of very particular base rings that look a lot like fields eg artinian rings or pid you are pretty much in the jungle  and when you get to noncommutative base rings it gets even worse for example the composition of two linear endomorphisms of a module may not be linear etc
  and when you get to noncommutative base rings it gets even worse for example the composition of two linear endomorphisms of a module may not be linear etc  the equivalent of a linear maps for modules is homomorphisms which do compose to homomorphisms    also as long as you work with modules over a kalgebra the underlying module will in particular be a kvectorspace there is a forgetfull functor so life is usually not so bad
  fuck i now feel betrayed  i have quite a good geometric thinking but when i went into math i was so royally fucked by abstraction that had to switch majors to engineering  now im redescovering the geometric approach to higher math and finally becoming good at it    when did philosophers take over math bros was it (((godel))) and (((wittgestein)))
  the equivalent of a linear maps for modules is homomorphisms which do compose to homomorphisms  oh yeah of course i got confused i was thinking of the fact that it does not form an algebra over the base ring
  when did philosophers take over math bros was it (((godel))) and (((wittgestein)))  bourbaki   geometric approach  bear in mind that mathematicians when talking about geometry do not mean analytic geometry but rather sheaves bundles connections homeomorphisms riemannian manifolds that sort of stuff   you cant escape abstractions and will have to learn to deal with them but often geometric/physical intuition is indeed ignored in textbooks
linear algebra is trivial and should be taught in primary schools
  agreed my high school already included matrices determinants and vector math so its not a huge leap
im a fan of linear algebra done wrong no joke  
valenza is the better brainlet introduction
    thanks it is great indeed
  people should say matrix algebra sometimes instead of always saying linear algebra you can to linear algebra without matrices but usually when nonexpert people refer to linear algebra they are talking about matrices instead of the lines that give linear algebra its name
  friedberg  whats the name of the textbook
i wouldnt advise studying these sort of books if youre an electrical engineering brainlet    stick to lays linear algebra book
grossman
  they should switch the names of this one and axlers
i havent finished it only halfway through and i havent taken linear as a class yet but i havent had big gripes with the book
    its part of the giant /sci/ textbook repository theres no link on the wiki and the /t/ thread has long since 404d fortunately i saved the magnet link   magnetxturnbtihdc3f817975680c54e3ed1a30018cabed97404dd4dn  there still should be 3 or 4 seeders
  the one youve been taught could be and has been soviets proper linear algebra is about the exterior algebra and spectral decomposition i hope you dont think thank multiplying matrices makes you a linear algebra expert lol
  hes probably an ee brainlet they have to take one semester of basic applied linear algebra
      ee is backwater and never should be allowed to join developed countries they never be as ordered as germans and ingenious as brits
  i meant ee as in electrical engineer     im an ee/math double major and almost every ee major is an egotistical pseudointellectual    they never believe me when i say upper level math classes are a lot more difficult than ee classes
    they are presented facts without proof so they have delusions of grandeur    while many people had shitty lives for proving them not having kids and simple pleasures not fapping or just fapping too much
  a level further mathematics has some basic linear algebra stuff  matrix operations eigenvalues and eigenvectors finding inverses of 3x3 matrices vector spaces etc though all of it is on a simple computational level for the most part
  that one is just as shit
  this book should be called linear algebra done wrong    there is a book with that title because of that issue
  its called linear algebra  what else would it be called idiot
    op here  i am a pure mathematics major in my senior year im well past normal linear algebra which is why i am seeking recommendations for textbook on /abstract/ linear algebra specifically textbooks that take a heavier determinant approach       matrix algebra used to be taught in high school where im from but they have since removed it from curriculums because it wont help you on any ap exams
  problems and theorems in linear algebra by prasolov to see if your basic skills really are on point  then maybe a book on advanced linear algebra topics eg farenicks algebras of linear transformations romans advanced linear algebra  after that just look at generalizations of linear or bilinear algebra in various directions for example the representation theory of algebras or operator theory or the algebraic theory of quadratic forms or projective geometry or commutative algebra
which major outside of math itself uses the most linear algebra
  i use it a lot in computer science machine learning 3d graphics
  i actually learned linear algebra from the book in question i thought it was a reasonable approach determinants and other scalar invariants are eventually discussed the final chapter and the rest of the developments proceed fairly intuitively without determinants determinants appear as weird and unintuitive sums over permutations and linear algebra is greatly simplified by not involving them so saliently indeed one should usually attempt to do linear algebra without ever having to commit to a base or even mention matrices
  thank you for the recommendations
  it also shows up in physics particularly in qm and relativity
  educators  protecting their bottom line by hiding the pathway so to speak
  vector analysis etc einstein
  vector analysis isnt linear algebra
  i have been teaching mathematics for several years and people on our faculty are diehard bourbakists but they have no malicious intent i dont think arnold meant it either desu
  solving determinants as sums of permutations is great if youre trying to solve giant matrices in a computationally efficient way but you might wonder what the fuck its for at that point   theres no reason to hide the ball  hubbard  hubbard masterrace
  wew
  matrix algebra is taught at good highschools the rest of lin alg is not because they dont have time at the pace they move at preparing do many brainlet children of tiger parents for ap exam and sats
  they should replace high school calculus with linear algebra its much more important for more people now   t computer engineer
  in plenty of math heavy fields it becomes as fundamental as arithmetic you are not going to solve all problems with just knowing it well but it will come up as algebra comes in between derivations
so banter aside is linear algebra say over the reals decidable
  but statistics is even more important whether you do stem or not

how do i cope with having a below 30 gpa i didnt fail any of my classes i just have a lot of cs
what major average gpa for math and chem is sub 30
    mechanical engineering
  what are your goals if you just want a job i wouldnt worry about it honestly i know the job market is competitive etc but you can probably still find something my dad graduated with a miserable gpa in mech e and went on to work for a fairly prestigious company and have a great career if grad school you need to figure something out
  how might i add what did your dad leverage against his low gpa
    my boomer father did the thing and so the conditions are the same for you friend  if i was you op i would be at least a little perturbed
  how bad is it mine is a 297 with 2 sem left i should get it above 30
year three ee here never gotten a c whats it like
  i got into pharmacy school with a 287
  lol
  literally how  actually curious because i am a 30 who wants to go into medicine as well
i have a 265 gpa and am a computer science major how fucked am i
  do you have a portfolio at all

whats the problem with cs theyre good grades does the us really have that big of a problem with grade inflation less than 20 get as or bs here
    c means average it means you only have bare minimum knowledge of the class if you are planning on getting a phd or masters degree then cs probably wont look good
  c  bare minimum  d exists
  c is practically failing in usa
  study to your tests remeber the subject matter if you still get cs report your teachers
  anons im in big trouble in my quantum mechanics class i did very poorly on the two midterms and am failing the class now im intending to go speak to my professor today but was just thinking of asking questions about the material today and then on thursday asking about my grade so i dont seem like a grade grubber    any tips on how to approach this this is the first time ive done so abysmally should i propose for him to just fail me if i score below a 75 on the final and use whatever is my raw score as my score in the class/exam section    would really appreciate any input on how to make sure i pass this class anons
  only speaking to your professor after youve failed two exams  heres me in my foundation of engineering demanding as much of my professors time as possible to drag me through because i dont have a background in maths best thing is literally noone else asks for help go see your professor anon speak to everyone you can
    i would consider c to be failing in humanities classes like history or english but i wouldnt consider it to be failing in stem classes where around half of the class will probably either withdraw or get a d/f
  him being a boomer is probably part of it this was 1977 and he went to a job fair and his boss knew his gpa was bad but liked him and basically hired him on the spot    its kind of depressing i suppose but i was trying to give you some hope i just dont know how things got so bad in this day and age
    i understand anon and im doing that first one i blew off because i had a time conflict which didnt let me study for it much second exam i just studied wrong material to be fair there were many kids like me since he didnt tell us what hed be testing us on how do i approach him this late though anon
  are you available any time soon i need some help with the current material    remember that youre literally paying this guy to teach you anon
  i need you to get a job on a med school admissions board as soon as possible you have the right attitude
2729 is the average gpa for most stem majors even the average gpa at mit barely scrapes 30
have 3 bachelors degrees ee comp sci physics  all 3 done at same time while i was an alcoholic   22 gpa ee  22 gpa cs  24 gpa physics  right out of college get offer after applying for ee job with only ee degree listed no gpa listed  second job working as adjunct faculty for physics dept in decent sized uni  third job right back to ee as startup  today working in cs field for defence contracts  i have never been asked about my gpa nor have i been asked to prove i have degrees even outside of ee its kind of a joke when you think about it
    yeah you obviously need grades higher than c for med school my point is a c in a class like real analysis isnt as lazy as a c in a class like literature
  i know a friend who is a mechanical engineer 29gpa landed a good job 70k starting and lives in a low cost of living area grad school might be difficult to get into though
  you dont actually i talked to some of the people who handle applications on the board of uw seattles medical school and they basically told me this    higher chance regardless of gpa if underrepresented group including trannies and the like you can just lie and not dress up  nonnormal degrees are easier to get in so long as it has some sort of biology/chemistry background in it i was given the specific example of bioengineering or biophysics  being published in any semirelatable field can completely offset a shit gpa down to even 20 regardless of the papers topic/usefulness/ingenuity    obviously im not them so i dont know exactly how far the above goes and its been a few years but i assume it still holds true today
  im a physics major at a top 3 uni in unite states with a 30 gpa but 3 papers already published and am a lab manager am i screwed to get into a top md/phd program my professors think im bright but idk my grades are shit but i always work 20 hours a week to support my family and myself through college
  you are fucked it took me a year and a half to get a shitty job with a 32 and thats with really good project experience
  im thinking of going to office hours so i dont need an individual time how do i bring up passing the class though

why isnt there some sort of floating observatory on the sea wouldnt it be good against light pollution
brilliantjpg
  because theres literally thousands of square miles of land in the us where there is zero light pollution
  yeah but there could be an international station like the space thingy it would be for those scientists that were not good enough to become astronauts
  the iss is useful because being in orbit lets you conduct certain types of research not possible on more accessible locations like on earth please name something that you can only do while on a floating observatory
  more atmospheremountain better
  please name something you could do on land that you couldnt on a floating observatory in any case im not talking about replacing the iss here
  fuck i dont know op    why arent observatories built on giant seesaws
  so you cant provide any incentive to build a floating observatory and are asking us why it isnt being done are you stupid
  mah dude  already answered i thought that light pollution was a more serious problem than this the rest is just a joke
why isnt there some sort of floating observatory on the sea  shitty weather and the telescope needs to have a robust ground so it cant be floating around mountains are better
  the rest is just a joke  jjust kidding guys i was ttrolling
  when you are looking at stuff that far away i imagine your telescope cant be moving side to side its probably hard to take a nice picture of the moon on a boat let alone a much smaller star that is much dimmer as well

  she looks like a man i would rather give my notes to the blonde behind her
  yyes
  implying i take notes
id let her take a picture of my notes but then when i need it i will ask some favor from her if she refuses i wouldnt let lend her my notes anymore pretty simple
  lets follow the conversation further then    oh hee no i dont need to study with you thats ok  alright and depending good luck  end interaction    oh man im such a cuck sucker tool i wasted 2 minutes copying a sheet of paper and i dont even get to touch her boobs what a loser i am for just wanting to help someone out yeah i know i bet if i told that stupid broad to beat it and take her own damn notes next time yeah shed be all over me life would be grand im feeling euphoric just thinking about putting that little slut in her place think youre gonna get anywhere in the real world think you get something for nothing you want my notes i at least expect some tits if not her on her knees yeah thatll show her if i do that enough times theyll know and have no choice but to treat me like chad    lol
  i think the idea isnt that she would ever fuck you anon its that her interaction with you reduces to a utilitarian one

i use mendeley to organize the papers i read  question if i attach the files that i downloaded illegally will they find out  also is endnote better
pls answer
this ought to go in a /sqt/ but use zotero with local storage
endnote has kind of a different purpose the equivalent to mendeley would be zotero mendeley is also owned by elsevier so maybe choose an alternative m8

  i use mendeley to organize the papers i read  do you really need to do dis

  just for the record i never got any scholarships because i didnt apply to any yeah yeah my grades werent high enough to get automatic scholarships but they couldve been if i did more work i always comes down to work iq is a spook for spooks giving away free shit is morally reprehensible anyway
  no need my moderate level studying is enough to be in the top 10 and my natural charms and curiosity for my chosen field is enough to lend me a nice job before graduating even  i have no need to complain unlike you and you know why
  bragging to strangers is pathetic
  yes to those who are pathetic that is the exact point of bragging
  moderate keep telling yourself that  maybe youre just an effective student and your short study sessions are are extremely intense either way its effort not iq that makes you successful
  this feels good earning 300k starting while plebs are struggling at 30k salaries
  i was hard on myself in te pre finals and finals studies at the end of 2nd semester and i was so out of energy i had to rest for two weeks into the summer break effectively reducing my hard earned break which was alone maddening  so i quit being a tryhard and took it easy surprisingly my performance and grades also went up  i have a couple classmates in the top 10 who are tryhards never go out always study to the point of being boring and visibly out of spirit broken husks one of them shot me an angry stare of pure hatred when i asked what this scholarship medal ceremony was about i had to attend didnt even know we had any awards and complimentary notes until that point
  alright fuck it im going full tryhard mode right now this will be my last post
  youre being sterilized and brain damaged by wireless devices so unless max hedonism all pointless    join the right side dont accept the role
  you can do it anon you are god
  nice blog post which fan fiction is this
from a scientific perspective which paranormal phenomena or cryptid would you say is most likely to not be fake pic related for me the swamp ape could just be an escaped orangutan
  ball lightning
  obvious one is aliens
kraken not on the surface like in pic but in the deep
orang pendek almost certainly existed within the past century or two
  this even more so if you dont they have been on earth but i definitely do
  angels
santa
  thats clearly a shopped dude in a hollywood costume
the oarfish a lot old depictions of sea monsters match it to a tee
  tfw all those animals we will never find because they recently went extinct thanks to us
  god  i think its a boltzzman brain
  already been found m8
  oopsie daisy
  that was confirmed a few years ago we caught ya boy on spectogram
ayliums bigfoot actually saw one while driving home from work one night in sw pa maybe dogmen too since reports are popping up for them all over the place now what a time to be alive
  its actually a superintelligent ai
  bigfoot  you cant honestly think there is an entire population of these things big enough to be stable yet at the same time not be discovered in california of all places
  fuggggg
  well i sure as shit didnt see a guy in a suit or an upright auburn bear leap sideways off some railroad tracks that night in july    people come across evidence and sightings of them all the time  we just live in a world where negative stigma surrounds conversation about these things if youre a reputable scientist a good way to lose all credibility is to go off and search for bigfoot that and govt suppression seem to help control any definitive discoveries about these creatures
  the finding of an extant humanoid species of ape or another hominid would drastically change our understanding of evolution in north america and probably world wide discussion of primate evolution and every single ecologist and evolutionary biologist zoologist would be ecstatic if such a thing were found to be true there are no remains no footprints no traces of dna or evidences of ape habitation in the pnw or northern california anon
  but think of all the unknown animals lurking in the depths of the ocean right now very spooky
  you dont have to be a scientist just shoot one of them and bring it in and people will go crazy over it
  you have all these field researchers across the globe exploring and collecting data while putting themselves in dangerous positions as i said before there is evidence and dna but the high amount of cynicism prevents any finding short of an intact body to had for study and even then the government will step in and commandeer it for you      why the fuck would i want to do that i think i got incredibly lucky that night in 2016 when i beamed it with my flashlight while it was hunched over on those tracks i highly doubt ill see it ever again especially on the outskirts of a city like pittsburgh my guess is they migrate during the colder months since shortly after my encounter i felt delirious and thought i imagined the entire sequence i went online and found some archive of reports in the area and an encounter on the same road and same month as mine popped up in there only just 5 years prior    i havent personally seen any ufos in the sky or ghosts but after what i saw i give these kinds of things more of an open mind now for sure

  did you know the logic doctors use for gallbladder removal if you were likely to get gallstones once you will be likely to get them again isnt it a little bit beyond a doctors scope to say this
  yeah what are they statisticians
  my doctor  you cant get gallstones if you dont got no gall motherfucker  me  makes sense
    i dont see whats so wrong with changing lifestyle and taking anticholesterol drugs after gallbladder surgery
    rather than a full gallbladder extraction
good evening /sci/ i have a phd in mathematics and i wrote my thesis on quantum walks quantum mechanical analogues of classical random walks to get the feel for these objects i spent a lot of time making visualizations hundreds of which i have posted on youtube            earlier this year i presented artwork at the bridges math/art gallery in stockholm based on these quantum walks i got a few of these quantum walks printed on canvas and i have them hanging in my house and they look rather nice so i would like to share these with you for 35 you will get a 16x16 canvas of a figure of your choosing along with printed copies of some of my publications relating to the quantum walks as well as a few bootleg cds of audio interpretations of these processes if youre interested you can send me an email or dm me on twitter spvlabs thank you and have a good night
  no one on this god foresaken fuckin shithole site has phd if you mean pretty hard dick then aha but fuck off with the larping
  i guess i have to stop lurking here after my defense in a week then
email is spvlaboratoriesgmailcom      i have a doctorate but i do not have a pretty hard dick as i have severe erectile dysfunction no larp
    lol bro honestly i think many/most people on here are masters    i am 3 years into a phd in cancer biology and can prove it lol
here is what they look like on canvas      ive actually found it kind of surprising that there are some legitimately smart/wellstudied people on this board
  quantum walks quantum mechanical analogues of classical random walks  do you have a good introductory resource to the topic sounds interesting
  the best overviews are by venegasandraca and kempe which you can find on google scholar/arxiv they spend a lot of time talking about the quantum walk in connection with graph theory and algorithm development for quantum computers for more hands on analysis the 2001 paper onedimensional quantum walks by ambainis et al is how i got started in relation to these two dimensional qw the literature is kind of lacking imo there is a paper by baryshnikov from 10 years ago or so that deals with this but i find it unpalatable due to a heavy reliance on differential geometry and the results stated are not as useful as youd like i have a paper in review that answers some of these questions using algebraic geometry methods instead
  can you explain some of these visual patterns at a high level
  my double g that looks great if i had money i would buy them
  all closed quantum mechanical systems evolve via unitary evolution so you can think about these patterns as arising from repeated applications of a unitary transformation with certain nice properties ie amplitude only travels to adjacent vertices the different shapes that occur depend on the unitary transformation being used in short what you are looking at is the probability distribution of a particle undergoing some quantum evolution    now describing the patterns mathematically ends up being a tricky endeavor using method of stationary phase you can derive an integral representation of the quantum walk but for 2 dimensions it gets really messy up to this point what has been done is creating parameterizations of the regions isomorphic to points of stationary phase in the integral like pic related as you can see these parameterizations are really complicated and actually dont directly tell us a whole lot such as what the outline of that shape might be in my paper in review i go a step further and compute bifurcation curves isomorphic to critical points in the integral which sort of outline the structures you see in the images the upshot of this is that the curves you see are all algebraic however the method for computing this relies on solving a rather large system of polynomial equations which is not always computationally feasible however we can unrigorously simplify the system and basically cheat to get expressions of the outline which match with observation for example in the op image you can rigorously prove that the circle is indeed a circle the bottom center image is determined by too large of a system but you can write an order 8 algebraic curve which probably is a legitimate bifurcation curve for the top right you can cheat to show that the two ellipses are bifurcation curves but the rest of the system i think satisfies an order 16 algebraic curve
  the depicted qws are the canonical ones based on the simplest unitary transformations for general unitary transformations youre kind of sol although they are probably represented by order 32 algebraic equations
  venegasandraca and kempe  looks good ill take a look over the christmas holidays thanks
  if youre a phd student or a researcher i would recommend the field low barriers to entry and theres still a lot of low hanging fruit also now you can meme quantum computing and be taken seriously might not be that way in 30 years
  i did some qc stuff in my undergrad but im not really in the field anymore but it sounds interesting and i still do a lot of stuff with random walks so seems like it could be fun as a recreational read
in laymens terms i assume this is some physics jargon
  ive watched almost all of pbs space time so im pretty much on the same level
  the mathematical definition makes more sense than this i would honestly skip ahead
  god damnit learned ans still learning the basics of quantum mechanics i understand it and i feel quite good about it then i come across someone like you and i feel like a brainlet
  does your advisor work under operator theory
  how has it impacted your sex life or if you are a virgin do you think you still be one if you didnt have ed  t micropenis
  still struggling to understand the full message how would you recommend going about understanding this with literally zero exposure to physics aside from introductory physics courses
  when its written out like that it looks quite complicated but if you saw the individual components of the problem you might not be as intimidated really its a math endeavor and not a quantum mechanics problem so if you havent been exposed to some of the math it might be tough keep learning though and never assume youre a brainlet but that someone who seems smarter than you has just had more practice and been exposed to more stuff      my advisor had his toes dipped in a large variety of topics bioinformatics financial math qm neuroscience probability functional analysis etc but yes i did learn functional analysis from him if youre looking to learn functional analysis on your own i would strongly recommend kreyszigs book      i was joking about having ed but read up some articles in cosmo or buzzfeed about the mechanics of penetrative sex and you might be relieved    i waited until marriage to have sex and i would strongly recommend that option modern society is far too focused on sex and not enough on the fundamentals of social relationships with the opposite sex for the purpose of raising healthy children i have come to the conclusion that if you are going to have children at some point in your life then being a parent is the most important job you will have above all else contributions to humanity sex etc your spouse should be a person that shares this vision if you go through life overly concerned about your sexual activity or lack thereof then you are neglecting a huge component of the human experience stop worrying about being a virgin and focus on finding someone you can emotionally/intellectually connect with they are out there
  you are starting from the same place as me then probably even better because i hadnt taken physics since high school for me the first few chapters of griffiths was enough once you get past the basic qm notations and motivations then the rest becomes math specifically functional analysis probability and fill in the gaps depending on what direction you take it    also when youre reading research papers youre not necessarily dealing with masters of pedagogy the way that you might be with established textbooks especially with introduction sections never assume that youre a brainlet but that the explanations are not satisfactory like i know what theyre trying to say in the section you circled but i cannot see how you possibly could get anything useful out of that section unless youve seen the mathematical definition of the quantum walk i would look at the venegasandraca article or the kempe article instead and pay special attention to the precise definition as most of the summaries obfuscate the point if youve never seen it before
bump cool thread
okay if you want to purchase one of these you can select from one of the six shapes posted at the beginning or from one of these shapes
you can also choose from one of these absorption schemes the dynamic absorption will look better with a different color scheme and for a fully generated figure the ones in this image are 500 iterations while the ones you would purchase i conduct 2500 iterations i will post color scheme choices tomorrow
  so this is what you can do with a phd in math some shitty shapes
what do you think are some niche branches of mathematics or mathematical physics that are worth getting into during grad school  in your experience what does it take to complete a phd in math
  math  quantum anything  die slowly
  you can keep your photoshop shit your printed at costco bög
  yes is there really anything else      cant really comment on opportune subfields in math youll find that most people really dig themselves into a particular branch of mathematics and its not so easy to switch gears in terms of what it takes to complete a phd its steadfast focus your only job is to write a thesis and defend it this really has less to do with intelligence/ability and more to do with selfmotivation and proper positioning in my case i picked a pretty easy field with lots of low hanging fruit and got out in four years other people are interested in millenium problems and can spend a decade in grad school researching navierstokes without anything to show for it        i will fuck you
honestly if you sent this to adult swim or at least early 2000s adult swim theyll use them for bumps
  i have a phd
bump
okay to formally define this you can choose     a shape from    an absorption scheme from    a color scheme from pic related    you can also choose any shapecolor scheme from     the model figures seen here are very low res 100 iterations and the one printed will be 2500 iterations so they will appear very crisp and detailed    package will include  16x16 canvas image of quantum walk  3 bootleg cds  printed copy of a qw paper
i grew up in a liberal family and never had a silver racism in me i never questioned black iq or why africa is a shithole my excuses were always environmental africa got colonized blacks have been held back because of racism but now that ive spent a lot of time on /sci/ ive become slightly racist i mean i dont hate or dislike people cause theyre black or hispanic i mean i have black and hispanic friends but now i seriously question if the reason blacks are in the situations they are incrime very undeveloped countries is because they are genetically dumber then other races what is the consensus of why black iq is like 75 in africa is it genetic or are certain races victims of things like colonization etc if they are dumber then average how long will take for them to get to average and is it even possible if i ever bring this topic up to my immediate family they will instantly assume im some hateful racist when really i just want the truth and the ability for an open discussion    the biggest thing that worries me is that since we have so many immigrants from central/south america immigrating to the usa with no filter for the quality of people we let in all the 85 iq folks are the main source that in 50 years when hispanic people become a majority that this will dumb down america and the usa become more like the less useful countries in south america this serious question can be applied to mass immigration from the middle east to europe is this a serious threat
  africa or any of the worlds poorest areas with lack of resource and structured living is always a life of minimalism it takes generations to adapt sophisticated lifestyles for us we already perceive as normal im sure there are plenty of smart cookies in africa or the hood or we but there is no way for it to sustainably manifest humans are fickle mate
  successful countries in south america    also ive heard a lot about white genocide and it totally seems like some white supremacist conspiracy theory but looking at the population of white people in the world and their birth rates compared to african or hispanic birth rates it seems like this is not totally farfetched
  i grew up in a liberal family  is that why youre so obsessed with race
  its just been on my mind a lot just never really questioned it before ive actually become more centrist in the last couple of years
  okay nigs r dum and no it is not a serious threat    is that what you wanted to hear
  this iq is indeed a good test for intelligence but that doesnt mean its inherently genetic     we draw genetic connections because wealth is intergenerational
  global birth rates are declining    whites are just slightly ahead of the curve but that kind of makes sense considering the capitalistic dominance of countries at high latitudes
  whites slowly disappearing because of low birthrates and recessive phenotypes / genocide
  the differences between black and white americans are mostly genetic the differences between black americans and africans are environmental so the iq of black africans would be 85 in a good environment black americans need some sort of biological o go from 85 to 100 gene editing could be useful maybe epigenetics might make a difference theres even the whole hologenome thing going on but its never going to come from giving black americans more money
    iq is based upon the white western idea of intelligence    inb4whydoeastasiansscorehigh    because their education system is more westernised
  iq is a social construct the post
   the differences between black americans and africans are environmental   completely and absolutely wrong most africanamericans have a significant european admixture even if its not visible on the first sight the average african looks like ops pic while africanamericans are much more pale and often have a hint of european facial structure in them
  genetically dumber then other races  a good plce to start would be spelling properly
  how high is the sky the metric
  blacks in the united states are genetically on average 20 european theyre genetically not the same as africans so you cant assume that the iq gap is enviornmental
  i would be willing to do what ops doing for a more respectable pay    pretending youre not what you are its genetics
  iq is not a good indicator of intelligence but yes i agree by looking at prison and crime rates standardized testing scores world history pop culture and the people around me ive come to the conclusion that there is a definite possibility of genetic racial intelligence differences
im legitimately not trying to jerk myself off but i honestly dont understand how any reasonably intelligent person that went to school with average kids could believe theres not a huge genetic component to intelligence the difference between smart people and even well off hard working average kids is ridiculously noticeable      the western/asian idea of intelligence seems to correlate well with ability to reason logically solve problems create technology etc maybe theres an alternate test where low iq races destroy high iq ones but theres no reason to give a shit until people harping on this alternate metrics hypothetical existence can actually produce it and show that it has some utility    even then youre not really invalidating the western idea of intelligence youre just pointing out that a different concept is also useful
  sounds like you need to read the bell curve
    the western/asian idea of intelligence seems to correlate well with ability to reason logically solve problems create technology etc    iran/persia has produced hundreds of scientists mathematiciansand philosophers yet they apparently have a lower average iq compared to the west
  do there happen to be multiple ethnic groups with dissimilar iq in the region or just a lot of variance in general    i dont actually have statistics but i know even in modern times a lot of stem grad students in american universities come from the middle east and i have no reason to believe theyre lower iq than other students
  why does ebonics exist as a serious language  if you come to america you speak the english language like the rest of us once you make up an imaginary dialect because youre too dumb to keep up then you make up all kinds of things to separate yourself from everyone else
  iq is currency to tell you about a persons current status not eternal status
  the biggest thing that worries me is that since we have so many immigrants from central/south america immigrating to the usa with no filter for the quality of people we let in all the 85 iq folks are the main source that in 50 years when hispanic people become a majority that this will dumb down america and the usa become more like the less useful countries in south america this serious question can be applied to mass immigration from the middle east to europe is this a serious threat    literally eugenics
  all praise be to allah this post reads like the thoughts of the quintessential /sci/ autist every time i think this taiwanese board cant get any more retarded a fine specimen like yourself happens to sperg out all over his keyboard never change /sci/
  why  nations  fail  my dude
  exactly this        the bell curve controversy is a prime example of how science can easily become nonobjetive and subject to feelings          theres a lot of statistical evidence for cognitive capacities/differences in races this doesnt mean that every black person is retarded its just that the median is lower it also means that many blacks are more intelligent than the median of whites but if we take a whole populous white countries/societies will have better results in terms of developement    and not only statistical data but you can even see it in plain sight
  iq is based upon the white western idea of intelligence    yeah its based on solving problems    thats why africa is such a shithole  they cant solve problems very well
living in africa  large game is everywhere fruit and edible vegetation everywhere  warm enough year round to grow simple crops without effort  higher temperature means shelter just has to get you out of immediate sun when its too hot and dissuade animals from coming in  rains come and go with season some areas uninhabitable during rainy season some the opposite   thus nomadism is warranted food is easy to acquire and overall you need little to no real problem solving skills to thrive at least prior to overpopulation    compare with asian/european  much colder harsher environment  large game still but harder to hunt with temperature large forests less fruit/edible plants overall contributing to harder to acquire resources  fire a necessity leading to more access to easier to break down carbohydrates cooking as a result of constant upkeep/creation of fire  harsher winter requires much more sophisticated shelter for the time   less access to aforementioned foraging items means its more beneficial to implement farming better ways of farming stem from higher usage    europeans/asians had to adapt more to the environment and as such developed better problem solving skills over time     parts of africa today still have people who cant do the simplest of things tending to plants keeping livestock etc     obviously if you believe that we all came from subsaharan africa then the above is the only real conclusion that can be drawn
    so given that iq 100 is the average most blacks most of the black distribution lies left or the red line are dumber than average    looking at iq 120 and above there are almost no blacks there while there is a sizeable chunk of the white distribution in this range
  that graph doesnt account for me at 155 i feel underrepresented and am going to have to sue you to update your graphic for diversity standards
    completely and absolutely wrong most africanamericans have a significant european admixture  15 white ancestry doesnt explain the iq gap between black americans and africans that would add may 2 iq points not 15 the iq gap between american blacks and africans is mostly environmental you seriously cant believe malnutrion lead poisoning and the rest of the shit that happens in africa doesnt affect them humans arent immune to harsh conditions
    but your post indicates an iq of 85 at most
  you gotta keep those kind of subjects in /pol/ some peeps are touchy with it and get slightly snippy because their best lowcog friend happens to be black    /pol/ might ten scoops worth of whoopass and angry noises but its thrice as honest    el oh el puta iq is not a universal and if tasked by experts completely cultureless test to see your inherit abillity to solve a problem go ahead and tell us all that iq was made just to keep darkies down love ya dude
by 2050 the european descended americans will be the minority of the population apparently
  it correlates to brain structure and reaction time its real
  how is that genocide  white people are not being coerced into making less babies declining birth rates is not even an exclusive thing to whites pic related is the fertility rate of middle eastern countries is there a middle eastern genocide as well
  race is the easy option to blame for africas lesser economic prosperity and it has absolutely no merit    there are numerous reasons but one thing thats important to note is it isnt as bad as you think charity adverts have long since given us an idea of africa as an entire nation of literal mud huts and shanties yes those exist but theres also lots of actual cities and towns bussiness and trade they are actually developing    anyway onto the reasons    overpopulation  as in all countries its caused by advances in medical care reducing infantry mortaility while the cultural practice of having a lot of children remains a massive population boom occurs resulting in poverty  exploitation  many african nations are simply not allowed to prosper companies have too much invested in sucking african nations dry while providing little benefit to the population   world politics  not so relevant today but during the cold war era the cold war was also fought in africa nations tore themselves apart in conflicts between soviet backed governments and western backed governments neither sided cared for the people or prosperity just control which ruinous civil wars  they just are behind  civilisation is new to humanity we have existed for around 200000 years civilisation only really got going about 5000 years ago europe didnt have it until maybe 3000 years ago and in subsaharan africa it didnt get going properly until about 1000 ad and only in parts much of africa was still tribal until recently this puts them at an inherent disadvantage but its just down to geography and time its not racial civilisation has to spread from a source and that takes time and africa is vast    anyway you can ignore this and say its because theyre dumb black people if you like
    iq doesnt mean shit in this situation     iq is absolutely tied to environment if you grow up in a poor place with little food and no education your brain development will be straight up stunted
dismissing an idea just because it comes from supremacists or rightwingers is shortsighted you did well to give it a second thought  something many liberals dont do out of the belief that they can never be wrong because theyre being nice     there are intelligence people in all races but mass migration is not the way its common sense but every politician in the top european countries are opening borders and willingly let their country get assfucked we have a shortage in knowledge intensive workers not grunt labor importing so much retards in can never be a good thing once again intelligent people exists in all races but unfiltered immigration can never be a good thing
  youre providing justification to a problem in need of a solution     even if theyre disadvantaged it doesnt change the statistical facts of the present
i dont understand how black iq can be 75 i know many of us are dumb but does that make me an outlier or are these tests bullshit    i went to cambridge no affirmative action
  the solution is economic freedom so that they can generate wealth and get out of it they genuinely will sort themselves out if they have that almost all countries have experienced what africa is going through and are now coming out of it its called the demographic transition model    of course the rampant leftism in the world will try to prevent that leaving them in poverty for as long as possible
  you are definitely an outlier just because the majority of blacks are dumb does not mean that there cant be smart blacks
immigration self selects for smart people this has been the case since forever
  yes but there is a regression to the mean iq for every haplo group jamal might be a 135 iq surgeon but further down his blood line this high iq will regress to his ethnic mean
  its easy they dont face problems like iq test in environment so they havent adapted to solve them    also immigration is bullshit and it should be stopped
  the demographic transition model does not work the same way across different populations a country with a mean iq of 72 is not going to transform itself the same way that a 103 iq nation would
  are you trying to say that iq is not heritable now you dont understand what regression to the mean means smart people have smart children regression to the mean is when there is exceptional genius or some other exceptional trait but immigrants are not one off genius they are just more successful smarter people  in any case statistics show this to be the case anyway so you have no basis to make such stupid claims
  explains why eskimos are all geniuses and why civilization developed in the middle east africa india and china thousands of years before europe
  im redpilled on it many of my friends growing up are in jail chinks have it so good
  iq means nothing and is simply a symptom     besides the masses even when averaging 100 iq dont do shit a countries rise always comes down to a few smart individuals
  iq is in no way a measurement of current status what are you talking about
  that this will dumb down america  buddy have i got some news for you
  what is tribal layout   what are cultural institutions ie murdious victory or polygamy  what is war attrition   what is extreme otherism   yep i think you just about solved it mr genius hows the research at cern going
   yet they apparently have a lower average iq compared to the west  average people dont go on to become scientists mathematicians and philosophers anon unless the average is significantly tilted to either direction eg one standard deviatio from a baseline of 100 it doesnt have a remarkable impact on the amount of top talent in the population
  iq means nothing  it measures capacity for abstraction and as such means very much  and is simply a symptom   you make no sense how can a metric be a symptom of something would you call a unit length ie metre or inch a symptom    strawmanning this hard  unless youre legitimately retarded or simply a useful idiot brainwashed cryptocommunist the post you responded to should make a lot of sense
  suggesting variables and causes that you hadnt thought of is straw manning   whatever you say smarty pants
  poor iq is a symptom of an underdeveloped country not the other way around
iq is a social construct and africans could have invented achieved everything other races have is theyd been given more favorable conditions hope that helps 
  north africa doesnt count
  these countries are starting to get flooded with africans pajeets etc too will any decent country survive
  the masses certainly do matter smart whites gave them irrigation systems they ripped them out of the ground to sell for scrap smart whites give them gasoline trucks and hundreds of them rush the area with buckets to try to collect and sell the gas when a truck crashesand they exploded
  why do vietnamese kids do better than black and even white american kids when they have very little educational resources
  no they literally arent  try to find a set of countries that can even possibly back up your racism then post a pic    
  fake news go outside you nerd cuck and count the shitskins
    31 percent of saudi arabia       in bahrain oman qatar and the uae the majority of the population comprises foreign laborers and in the latter two countries this number is as high as 80    rich arab counties are a prototype for replacement migration
  i dont think this is true india has africa tier average iq whereas indian migrants in the us have an average iq almost a full standard deviation about the national average
  they have a caste system that perpetuated thousands of years rulers and religious leaders were not allowed to breed with regular people
  i grew up in a liberal family and never had a silver racism in me
  they are not that genetically distant
  africans could have invented achieved everything other races have is theyd been given more favorable conditions  like better genes
  there is regression to the mean for every haplo group    you really dont know what youre talking about do you they must let just anyone post on this board
  yes what dont you understand
  not the person youre replying to but why isnt regression to the mean true please explain without hurrdurr brainlet posting im uninformed about it
its always funny when people excuse negro incompetence when jews have out performed them at every turn and faced greater challenges
  there is no racism in africa every single fucking country is 99 black the white minority that came from colonialism are so nonexistent in them that the black population has no clue they even exist
  race has no merit  yes anon if whites on average had poorly developed frontal lobes we would still be tribal fucktards in the paleolithic era in europe right now right now right fucking now as in 2018 ad still in the paleolithic era
  utterly fucking untrue what an uneducated nigger you are posting with such confidence
  because iq is largely determined by economic and lifestyle factors this is very well established not to mention if jamal is immigrating he is not placing himself in an environment with different genetic stock so his childrens children will be of a different ethnicity than himself anyway think anon
  whoa imagine that doofus anyone can post wha
  an iq test is extremely effective way of seeing if a person is currently able to intellectualy handle whatever task accordingly of course it will not properly show case the intelligence of all those who take it but those who readily excel are ready to take on similar intellectual tasks but again im saying iq is a status report someone can go study and work on puzzles problem solving etc and come back new the test is not even necessary give someone a test on any subject those who learned how to learn excel not everyone has the same practice or experience
  white people are not being coerced into making less babies  
  race is never mention there try again pointing to antinatalists at large proves nothing
  have you ever talked to a native subsaharan african they are incapable of critical thinking    i was in the peace corps in cameroon i was posted in a shitty little farming village no running water intermittent electricity i would go to the peace corps office in baffousam a bigger city for the internet access just about every weekend i would go to this little restaurant and order a rice dish for breakfast every morning there one time i was late and missed breakfast but i figured that they still had all the ingredients and could just make it anyways not like theyre sticklers about the rules any other time i was refused and i asked why they just kinda looked at me dumbfounded and just repeated themselves they clearly had no experience explaining anything i found out later that they make that dish in big batches and its a pain to make one portion why couldnt they just say that and thats not the only example every single time i asked a local why they did something i never got an answer deeper than because this is what we always do
     204 revolutionaries should have as many children as they can there is strong scientific evidence that social attitudes are to a significant extent inherited no one suggests that a social attitude is a direct outcome of a persons genetic constitution but it appears that personality traits are partly inherited and that certain personality traits tend within the context of our society to make a person more likely to hold this or that social attitude objections to these findings have been raised but the objections are feeble and seem to be ideologically motivated in any event no one denies that children tend on the average to hold social attitudes similar to those of their parents from our point of view it doesnt matter all that much whether the attitudes are passed on genetically or through childhood training in either case they are passed on    205 the trouble is that many of the people who are inclined to rebel against the industrial system are also concerned about the population problems hence they are apt to have few or no children in this way they may be handing the world over to the sort of people who support or at least accept the industrial system to insure the strength of the next generation of revolutionaries the present generation should reproduce itself abundantly in doing so they will be worsening the population problem only slightly and the important problem is to get rid of the industrial system because once the industrial system is gone the worlds population necessarily will decrease see paragraph 167 whereas if the industrial system survives it will continue developing new techniques of food production that may enable the worlds population to keep increasing almost indefinitely
  haha no    being able to solve and understand mathematical problem logic problems and say chess programming are external to western ideas they exist external to man     you can be a computer ai any colour or creed does not matter    can you solve the problem
  iq is largely determined by economic and lifestyle factors  lmao
  read up nerd  
  the biggest thing that worries me is that since we have so many immigrants from central/south america immigrating to the usa with no filter for the quality of people we let in all the 85 iq folks are the main source that in 50 years when hispanic people become a majority that this will dumb down america and the usa become more like the less useful countries in south america this serious question can be applied to mass immigration from the middle east to europe is this a serious threat  we are repeating the same error that the roman empire did the romans allowed germanics to get into the empire more and more and at the end almost all the army was formed by germanics and the empire went to shit
  a silver racism in me  what is the consensus of why  dumber then average  that whole runon sentence about the thing that worries him    i mean op i really hate black people and everything but maybe you should worry about your own iq before shitting on other people
say it was proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that black people lived in their squalid state simply because of their genetic makeup would that justify your insults and attitudes if youre honest the answer is no
how can melanin tell if a person is or isnt smart tell me /sci/ tell me    how can you hate someone you dont even jnow just because he has the same color as someone you already hate
guys you gotta check this out    i fucking laughed my ass off when i first saw this this helicopter looks like its made from papiermâché
  considering that skin color like iq is inherited they will often be inherited together so if you are black you are less likely to be intelligent
  middle east  theyre basically s europeans genetically pic related shows the divergence of regions
  how can you hate someone you dont even jnow just because he has the same color as someone you already hate    correlation and empirical induction    generalizations are sometimes wrong but more often than not they actually work do you think its a coincidence that the jews were hated by anyone who had to deal with them throughout history
  with no filter for the quality of people we let in  you have no idea how immigration works please leave
  ok how are there 12 million illegal immigrants in the us then how come many have been deported more than once how come many leftists want to abolish ice
  iq is largely determined by genetics tesla raised in a desolate serbian shithole would still beat you in a math exam by just looking at the textbook for only 7 minutes
  environment can explain not only negro americans having higher iqs than pure africans but pure africans having the iqs of white retards on average
  global birth rates are declining  not nigeria and other african countries
  15 white ancestry doesnt explain the iq gap between black americans and africans  of course it can  that would add may 2 iq points not 15  false conclusion
  then youre obviously on the positive tail of the bell curve
  lul
  dumber then  but maybe you should worry about your own grammar before shitting on other people
  as one statistically unlikely overperforming subhuman to another be grateful and dont think about it too much yes youre an outlier and yes blacks in africa according to lynns revised estimates average around 7075 iq with lows as far down as the 60s and as high in some places like civilized parts of nigeria and ethiopia as the high 80s the igbo probably have an average iq around 95100 like the parsi in india and the askhenazi among the other semitic groups but aside from that small enclave and groups found in ethiopia its extremely rare for their to be parity between the cognitive capacities of whites and africans mentioning it to family members is probably a waste of time and will only bring you heartache
  i am grateful but i want help my brethren you know only americans shy away from race iq but most successful africans know it to be true and resent the sorry state their countries are in ofc theres many other factors    an african will always do deals with a japanese/korean over another african
    do you date within your own race serious question
  an african will always do deals with a japanese/korean over another african  funny i always do business with good businessmen regardless of race fucking weird concept right
  i want to help  you can help them by telling them to institute eugenics programs and population control     im morall upstanding capitalist  t liberal racist
  an african will always do deals with a japanese/korean over another african    holl shit thats complete wrong they do business with people they trust or know        i just know  and  are larping as black people why do people do so i dunno maybe to provide some sort of see this guy agrees with me deal       lynns data is complete retardation and its basic fact how much data he fudges to make certain groups look bad or uses shit data      take data points discard any that doesnt fit your beliefs keep points that should be discarded due to being normal use immigrant communities far form the host nation make up data for several nations by using racial means to generate nonsense numbers use iq scores with no account of origin sample group or time period    just shitty statistics
  thats not how it works at all it doesnt mean that your kids regress to the racial mean but that say just because a woman is 65 doesnt mean that her kids will be that or taller it just means that they will be tall but not as freakishly tall as her because shes an outlier just like 135 iq is a fucking outlier jamals kid will be smart maybe not as smart as his father but still pretty bright because they regress to americas mean
    imagine being this retarded

  turbo brainlet coming through do prime factorization to get largest factor i cant think of any slick way to do it
  1 every natural is uniquely characterized by its prime factorization if you let mathn  p_1 cdot p_2  cdot p_k/math where mathp_i/math is the mathith/math smallest prime of mathn/math then its evident that mathp_1/math is the smallest and that if you took that prime out of the factorization the product of the other primes would be the largest factor     divide by primes starting at 2 until you get a divisor p n / p is your largest factor you can do a naive solution and just divide by naturals from 2 to the absolute value of n     2 go through list starting from the start iterate till the end if you find an entry a that is larger than the entry a  1 return false if you went through the entire array without doing that return true    work on your basic reasoning
    if i recall correctly theres an matho log n/math solution for finding the smallest prime do that for extra credit if you want
  i can find the smallest prime in o1
  are you a wizard
  whats your algorithm when i say smallest prime im referring to the smallest prime of n

is there a 3d equivalent to penrose tiling  ie a simple set of shapes able to be used to create almost any structure
never heard of it by why not  you can do 3d modeling with polygons
closest i can think of are tetrahedrons and pyramids

  there isnt even a 3d version of hexagons enragingly its only cubes
does anyone know why this circuit has this separation in the ground wire couldnt it be just reduced to one
that whole schematic looks sloppy notice how the ics pin numbers dont line up the output of pin 12 isnt inline with that 22uf capacitor and theres a jaggie between pin 1 and ground from this sloppimess i think its safe to say that whoever drew this did it carelessly and yes you can consolidate the grounds
  no reason they have the same potential whoever drew it was probably bad at cad software
      i can see both points but its gotta be something    if you take a look at the oficial datasheet of tca785        it has the same situation
on the actual circuit board that component requires a heavier ground trace
  ee postgrad with experience in pcb design here that bottom part of the schematic would give any supervising engineer an aneurysm that being said you have a point although the need for a wider trace should be at the discretion of the component itself and is to be reflected in the pcb design and not the schematic  ops pic was probably done by a freshman undergrad who got a placement through connections
    both wrong see  and

if there are multiple universes they would still be part of the fabric of reality this fabric manifests itself in an infinite number of forms forever you are a manifestation of reality and it is just the human perception that gives you the illusion of seperation from it therefore you have already attained infinite life just not as a human form why would you want your human form to last forever when you have infinite resurrection into any form forever     this fabric would be omnipotent omniscient and omnipresent    in order to be truly infinite it would have to be both limited and unlimited expanding and contracting at the same time    the tree of knowledge is meant to be symbolic of a magnetic field or a torus one end contractsroots and the other end expandsbranches the point between the two is the equilibrium between the two forces and is the 3rd dimension the apple symbology is to denote a torus expansion male contraction female    this is why after experiencing the tree and apple in the garden of eden adam and eve knew themselves male and female and knew how to create life 3d through the coming together of male and female    this duality is the true knowledge of the bible everything has a contractive and expansive force divide and conquer is an example of this knowledge being utilised in the world    the knowledge above was spread by christians in an attempt to alleviate people of their suffering and attachment to this brief existence by elevating their conciousness to a higher level and subsequently changing their perception of reality    in older versions of christianity before the romans mashed all the religions together using multiculturalism christ was the archetype of balance and harmony to embody this archetype was the ultimate goal of christians    meditating on this and looking for it out in the world will radically elevate your perceptions the secret of enlightenment is that nothing changes but your perceptions

how do you do gaussian elimination on singular matrixes  like the following one     2 4x1 6  1 2x2 3  is obviously a singular matrix  here the answer is supposed to be x13 0tx22 1t  i can understand in part as the gaussian eliminaton will result in an equation that will look like this  x12x23  thus  x132x2  but how do i come to that answer above    does tex work yet btw
  those matrices  just write them like any proper person  2 4 mathx_1/math  6  1 2 mathx_2/math  3  inb4 why the parenthesis above and the lines below  traditional sandwich notation

hydrochloric acid used optionally in the final reaction and its fumes are corrosive and also hazardous to human health  do i put a comma

why does isentropic compression of a gas lead to an increase in pressure
  hydrochloric acid used optionally in the final reaction has fumes that are corrosive and hazardous to human health    the hydrochloric acid that is used optionally in the final reaction has fumes that are corrosive and hazardous to human health
  in thermodynamics an isentropic process is an idealized thermodynamic process that is both adiabatic and reversible  an adiabatic process is one that occurs without transfer of heat or mass of substances between a thermodynamic system and its surroundings    pvnrt  n r t are constant  v decreases  therefore p increases

  suppose p is a prime that divides the order of a finite group g show that there exists an element of order p    the order of each element divides g i havent got that far yet with groups but would i be wrong in guessing that theres a correspondence between the order of each element in g and gs prime factorization
  
  how long would it take a determined full time student to do all of this outside their curricula  outside their curricula    much of it is common to most stem majors
    that makes sense this is one of the more fun topics ive studied there are a lot of familiar themes from linear algebra for instance identities like ab1b1 a1 that i previously just had to take at face value make a lot more sense

  use de rham cohomology mathh0(((0infty)))/math is the space of locally constant functions on math0infty/math so it suffices to show mathfg in h0(((0infty)))/math
  im the king of the brainlets and i was thinking about this on the crapper   i have a visual aid for my stupid question that doesnt deserve its own thread  but does entanglement survive the passage through an event horizon
  the quantum state mathxrangle/math merges with the state mathpsirangle/math of the blackhole and the quantum state mathyrangle/math is entangled with mathpsirangle/math  now the problem comes from the fact that blackholes evaporate via hawking radiation what happens if we keep feeding entangled particles into the blackhole so it evaporates away to the vacuum math0rangle/math theres nothing in the math0rangle/math for mathyrangle/math outside of the event horizon to entangle with so is the entanglement broken if this were the case then we lose information about the entangled state mathpsiyrangle/math we started with since we now only have mathyrangle/math this is the blackhole information paradox  heres a possible resolution 
i have separately that a x is a subset of a and x is not a subset of c and b x is a subset of b  i get that if you went about it very formally you would generalize a then specialize with b to conclude that x is a subset of a union c however do i need to do any word trickery in a proof to conclude this can i not just say thus we have that x is a subset of b and x is a subset of c and go from there or is it necessary to be more precise
  you force it from the definition

  the canonical sqt poster also does it desu
  x is not necessarily a subset of c    the fact that x is a subset of a is all you need because a is a subset of a union anything

he actually gets flu shots
  you
  he doesnt live in a bubble where no one can leave or enter so theres only one strain of flu ever
  multiple studies show near 0 effectiveness  loaded with poison and promotes massive inflammatory in the body / selectively altered gene expression  flu shots for seniors literally designed to cripple and kill promote dementia etc    follow the money  sure for a while but money is just a means to an end within a given ecology there is a bigger picture if not at first then eventually
  also hepatitis b vaccines literally cause brain damage not in some unlucky few but in everyone its just a matter of degree    yep you me everyone you know under a certain age i went to school with a girl who developed epilepsy after hepatitis b vaccine  
my dad got a flu shot and it fucked his arm up     hes actually getting a mri for it cause is been hurting for 4 months     how the fuck is that possible
  how the fuck is that possible  kind of depends what it did to him
  maybe hit a nerve or something
tfw i think antivaxers are nuts but feel weird about getting flu shots so i dont   why
  i get flu shots but im not a he
  in mice   good study anon
  those are related just so you know
  immune systems have some differences but the behavioral and functional endpoints correlate with humans    given that you likely deny vaccines cause any injury to begin with such reasoning is not available to you and we dont have much to talk about
  if mice are the same as humans why didnt it kill me when i stepped on a mousetrap
  inb4   dont you know that humans step on tens of mousetraps before they reach adulthood and no studies have tested prolonged exposure to mousetraps on humans
  guess i just got btfo
  they serve as useful models in fact hard studies are more valuable than epidemiological studies the sad fact is we cannot conduct them without splitting someone open afterward for examination
  visit new born nephews  sister demands i get a flu shot  how long do i have left to live bros
  flu shots for seniors literally designed to cripple and kill    and this is what clinical insanity looks like
  trauma from the needle injection in or near a nerve cluster it happens rarely with both with vaccines and blood being drawn
  check out the national vaccine injury compensation fund its like a billion dollars the government has set aside to give to people that suffer injuries from vaccines for over 6 months it was created from the idea you cant sue vaccine people
  however long it takes for you to kill yourself seeing how your sister was able to reproduce quickly despite not being very intelligent
  dude
  and blood being drawn  this happened to a roommate of mine lost all feeling in his arm because of it
be american  go to the hospital  get flu shot
  flu shots at the hospital you dont get them at random grocery stores cvs will even give you a coupon for doing it
  theyve got you trained sorry the truth is hard to take      at shaws theyll give you 10 off your groceries if you get a free flu shot
  at shaws theyll give you 10 off your groceries if you get a free flu shot  do stores not realize how weird that sounds
  they dont care incentivization or theyre in on it either way its all part of a greater plan and you dont need to know the full control structure to get the generally gist of it if you dont believe me look at the socalled literature on flu shots conducted by these manufacturers theyre a mess shit shuffled around to massage the data no placebo group comparison against other vaccines its ridiculous the independent literature is however far more directly damning    so yeah theyre putting weird shit in people who take the bait for who knows why
tfw college forces me to get one or i cant attend
  gosh a system like that couldnt be abused in any way    do they force anything else
  no just flu shots
  thats kind of odd mine is very very pushy about them but only tries to require everything else
kind of related  do your vaccines still work when you get aids  id say no but my last immuno classes are long gone
remember to get your flu shot goy
  only one way to find out just go get them and see how long you last
the cerebral palsys in this thread not a single shred of evidence other than feels     muh government is incompetent at healthcare therefore all health initiatives are a scam   proper first world countries with single payer nearly always subsidise flu vaccines   /x/  you need to go back
  weak bait
  you get sick if you dont take vaccines
    soon old piss op will be posting pic related
  flu vaccines are subsidized because everyone else taking them is good for you that doesnt imply its good for you to take them
  youll probably get the flu either way
  people actually get the flu  pathetic and bizarre
  i didnt get the flu for my whole life then i got it last year and thought i was poisoned or something i thought the flu was just like a really bad cold didnt realize it caused weird muscle aches and shivers and stuff went to the hospital doctor didnt know what was wrong with me told my friend and he was like fuck anon youve got the flu go home two days of netflix and drink tea on the couch and it was gone
if the electric filed vectors of unpolarized light point in all directions how come the dont cancel out
they dont point in all directions at every point in space at once dummy that would take some effort to arrange
  i think anon means in reference to where the 0 length vector would be all vectors of equal length with an opposite vector to cancel out
if were in a simulation how come infinite recursion doesnt crash the system
if were in a simulation how come infinite recursion doesnt crash the system  why would it
  its not running on (((intel)))
  excuse me but if we were in a simulation it would certainly run on jewish hardware
if this is a simulation why does it suck so much where is my qt gf i want my money back
  there is no recursion the state is part of your perception ie the state of your brain the universe isnt doing anything special if you put light between two mirrors why doesnt it crash the universe when it bounces around
  similarly to this i speculate that infinite recursion in this simulation may always lead to a circle or rather the completion of a loop
  ddid you just solve riemann
  quantum immortality prevents this
distance fog dumbass you can even see it in the picture
      all equally correct
  infinite recursion  doesnt exist
  we arent in a simulation we are in a finite subset that has bubbled out of the infinite ideal platonic realm
  the light doesnt bounce infinitely if the lights were turned off the room would go dark obviously so no problem  it may look like an infinite effect but its all implemented with finite numbers of photons bouncing around  sure its a lot of computation but who knows how much computational power may be available outside the simulation they could have access to weird physics that arent implemented in our universe
  it technically isnt infinite because light has finite speed
  they didnt use bethesda coders
  he didnt buy the dlc  sucks to be you
  even more simple than that is not infinite because you eventualy hit the limit resolution of the mirrors and just before that happens the image is just a blurry mess with no discernible information about the original so nothing infinite about it
    your fundamental assumption being that an analog mirror system wont have a relative resolution curve that goes beyond the level of the quantum along an infinite repeating image fractal
  if you want to put it that way
  this dont fall for the grinding meme next time guys
  because everything has tail recursion optimization
  its not infinite the light n is refracting each iteration until it will eventually disapate
  i was gonna say imagine if life was pay to win but it sort of is
  because our reality isnt infinitely subdivisible there are limits to the recursion based on planck length and planck time
  optimized
theres no recursion its all done using iterative algorithms
  you only exist in one moment but you believe you just existed a second ago the system crashed long ago
  this actually makes sense  idk much about physics but just iterating over all photons in the world for each planck timestep should solve the problem easily the photons are eventually absorbed and you always have a finite number of photons to iterate over  the infinity of the hall is just an illusion and there is actually no reason to use recursion
  this was a plot point in a stephen baxter short story the protagonist suspected we were in a planetarium so organized an international effort to bounce a laser beam of proximas planet his secret plan was that the sudden need to simulate a much larger region of space would not have been planned by the architects and would crash their systems thus forcing them to drop the illusion and show themselves
  are her eyes shrinking and expanding

  also calculating the eigenvalue when you have the eigenvector is literally just throwing it at the linear transformation and seeing by how much it was multiplied
  this is it knowing the slope is knowing the angle and vice versa and knowing the slope of db is one operation away from knowing the slope of the normal line at b
so anon you are taking the putnam tomorrow right
i was planning on it but i cant sleep
  im too brainlet
  fake those sages arent nearly as high up on that mountain enough or telepathic enough or floaty enough o

putting convection as a way of transferring heat in the same list with radiation and conduction is aberrant convection is just a phenomenon that occurs in a system where you find a fluid that is affected by some kind of pressure usually given by gravity but the transferring of heat itself is done by thermal conduction its a special situation its not universal unlike conduction and radiation it is just a consequence of what is already defined and implying that it deserves a spot as a fundamental way of transferring heat along with conduction and radiation is classic chemist bullshit   its like saying that since in my house heat is transferred by heat pipes heat pipes are then a way of transferring heat and should be but in the list along with fucking convection
   fluid that is affected by some kind of pressure usually given by gravity  brainlet here why is pressure important in convection
  i could explain it in the extensive way but ill just say this we know based on convection that basically heat goes up if there is no pressure no gravity which fucking way is up
well convection is different but you could make the argument that conduction is technically bs since ultimately its the electromagnetic field that mediates transfer by conduction so its really a special case of radiation    anyhow when you teach high schoolers how heat works its important to describe convection because the first question is always why do acs have blowers instead of just being a cold block there or why does my computer die if the fan on the processor stops
  isnt brownian motion an important part of convection how does a system without pressure have no brownian motion
  regarding conduction why do you say that the magnetic field is mediating the conduction its the mere kinetic interaction between particles magnetic fields of course play a role but not radiation per se    i understand the utility of teaching this to high schoolers but what theyre really understanding is that it is a universal property of heat which is false
  i dont understand your point im pretty sure you have brownian motion without pressure
  my point is that since you have brownian motion even when theres no pressure and since brownian motion is a part of convection the statement that gravity or pressure is needed for convection to occur must be false
  are you literally retarded even if brownian motion is needed for convection it doesnt mean that it is enough on its own if you dont have a clear idea of what convection is then a google search is just a few keystrokes away
  even if brownian motion is needed for convection it doesnt mean that it is enough on its own  enough on its own enough for what does it transfer heat in the liquid or not when do you draw the line of what is enough     are you literally retarded  didnt take too long for you to sperg out faggot and i thought we finally had a good thread kys
  on its own for fucking convection to occur youll realize how retarded you sound when you finally understand what convection is
  on its own for fucking convection to occur  brownian movement by itself is convection
  convection is useful as a concept because we can use it to model heat transport when coupled with a fluid dynamics model navierstokes    this shit is used to make jet engines and rockets so it clearly is useful even if you dont like it
  its not seriously do some research
  nobody doubted its utility useless comment
  convective heat and mass transfer takes place both by diffusion  the random brownian motion of individual particles in the fluid  and by advection in which matter or heat is transported by the largerscale motion of currents in the fluid in the context of heat and mass transfer the term convection is used to refer to the sum of advective and diffusive transfer    seriously do some research if you dont have a clear idea of what convection is then a google search is just a few keystrokes away
  i cant believe youre serious if by reading that what you understand is brownian motionconvection then i have bad news for you had a reason to sperg out after all
  doesnt understand what the term sum means     convection  brownian motion  aka sum advection    therefore if advection  0 due to your retarded gravity requirement then     convection  brownian movement    wasnt that hard imbecile
  treats sentences as literal mathematical sums    not how it works if you dont have advective transfers then brownian motion will just give yield regular conduction not convection  maybe this video will make it more clear 
  well at a microscopic level the electrons of the molecules of whatever system youre considering are not really hitting eachother in a contact interaction  they always interact via the electromagnetic force which you could look at either in terms of the electric field or in terms of the exchange of photons/phonons
  yeah what i meant wasnt that theyre directly touching but that their magnetic fields are interacting im not sure whether electromagnetic forces would play a role as well or just explaining it with magnetic force would be enough
  therefore if advection  0 due to your retarded gravity requirement  haha what gravity and pressure have effects on the motion of fluids as they transfer heat thats just a basic fact
complaining about a form of advection on a gujarati needlepoint imageboard
  convection occurs in fluids because different parts of the fluid will be at different temperatures which will lead to different densities and so brings about flow and so convection it has nothing to do with gravity or pressure    t undergrad
  if fire causes radiation how come yall dont get cancer from campfires huh
  there are 2 types of radiation  1 is essentially light  visible ultraviolet infrared thermal eg electromagnetic radiation  2 is particles given off by atomic decay electrons beta particles protons alpha particles also xrays are given off by atomic decay but are also electromagnetic radiation it also is created by stuff that is radioactive harmful
  t person who asks why their computer breaks when they unplug those noisy fans
lmao at reading this thread some of you guys are so fucking retarded /sci/ is such a joke
ok so different densities because of different temperatures why should there be any motion if there is no pressure applied on the fluid
  meant this to be a reply to 
  so many people are actually convinced you dont need pressure like there were a universal up direction in space i hope theyre middle schoolers
  ever heard of charge field physics its not actively pursued by a lot of physicists but the motivation behind it is to question establish preconceptions that dont really make sense
  who knows currently im a physics undergrad
  a fucking undergrad pretending he knows shit and belittling others  absolute state of /sci/
  shut the fuck up its about the argument you make not only your title
  thinks of himself as so high above middle schooler  is basically educationwise not much more than a middleschooler himself    youre such a fucking faggot cant make this shit up
  this what pseuds often dont understand that a model being descriptive is not enough it must also be practicable to reduce complexity you introduce abstraction just like conduction is an abstraction of some cases of radiation convection is an abstraction of some cases of conduction
  except there is an actual difference but whatever you say why dont you counter my argument instead of wasting your time with this bs
  i get it but as i said in another comment arent magnetic forces enough to explain conduction without introducing em radiation
  im here to tell you youre an arrogant faggot and generally a shit human being    and  already explained everything that needed to be said if you werent a fucking brainlet youd include conduction in your autistic rant too but obviously you dont understand shit
  magnetic forces are modulated by photons
    which makes me wanna point out that while you are dismissive of an abstraction like convection you embrace an abstraction like magnetic forces    in fact even photons are a mathematical abstraction that helps tie together a whole bunch of experimental data at the end of the day you have to accept an abstraction somewhere or you just end up with a load of unconnected data
  fair enough
  alright thanks
  sorry for the slow reply desu busy college days     from my understanding different temperatures will cause different densities in the fluid this in turn leads to buoyancy where the warmer part of the fluid will rise and the cooler part of the fluid will fall this in turn gives flow and so convection currents    at a molecular level i guess one needs to remember that fluids are molecules constantly in motion moving over each other colliding with each other and so if different parts of the fluid are at different energy levels different amounts of heat then this energy will spread by collisions between the individual molecules on a macroscopic level this leads to convection currents    its beerfriday anyway anon

  you dont need qm for that you quarter wit  it just works in the same manner things fall down towards the center of the earth
  yes you do semiconductors operate on quantum mechanical principles they are not magical oriental buttons that operate because some third world shaman blessed them to they were specifically designed and manufactured with their operating principles based on the interactions of the matter involved and the energy band gaps that exist on gasp the quantum level you need these band gaps to be specifically tuned to emit specific wavelengths of light  you cannot build an led of a specific wavelength without knowing this    additionally you cannot explain the observations of light bending in the presence of massive objects such as the sun without using general relativity youre so fucking dumb i hope you get attacked by a homeless person who gives you some life long illness like hepatitis or hiv/aids so you can suffer even more in your stupidity you deserve to be punished
  you typed all of that at a person who is clearly in a state of immutable incredulity
  throwing quantum buzzwords in your post only makes you sound more retarded  no band gaps but brain zaps when you try to type a sensible answer  leds work whether you invoke qm or not just like i can throw things without having to know about particle physics
  he said led of a specific wavelength you brainlet you need a predictive model in order to do that effectively otherwise youd be mashing things together blindly and wasting a lot of resources you need to know orbital mechanics to plot a mission to mars you need to know thermodynamics in order to optimize an engine likewise you need to know quantum mechanics in order to derive from scratch the correct specifications for microchip components
  call it what you want i still have rgb leds in my mouse and keyboard and they always work if you think that the quantum mechanics invoked in their design is bullshit i invite you to come up with a different way to get it right without using monkeys and typewriters furthermore i invite you to develop accurate gps satellites without correction factors invoking general and special relativity

physicists are just some wannabe mathematicians who cant elaborate complex thoughts without recurring to these pseudo science bullshit
  unfortunately reality seems to behave in an unintuitive manner and the ability to come up with something as sufficiently axiomatic as math to describe everything is probably beyond any man or machine luckily physicists do not aim to perfectly describe why things happen in reality they aim to explain the behavior of real stuff in the real world consistenly go look at when feynman is asked why about stuff its not our problem leave the why to the philosophers lol theyve done a whole lot in the last 2000 years and before you call it brainlet or useless ask yourself how we could come up with these great inventions like rockets sattelites modern communication systems etc without the physics to describe it go ask yourself what your contribution is to your 80 years in history

  allow me to interject what youre referring to as physicists are in fact experimentalists or as ive recently taken to calling them false physicists experimentalists are not physicists unto themselves but rather another plebian component of the fully functioning system of physics as made possible by theorists the patronage of old rich jews and experimentalists cheap labor components comprising a full area of study in modern science    many people rely on bastardized versions of theorists work without realizing it through a peculiar turn of events physics is perceived as a endless series of experiments and many of its users are not aware that it is built up on a rigorous framework developed by brave theorists    there really are experimentalists and to some degree they matter despite being replaceable but they are just one small part of physics as a whole experimentalists are like slaves they work away their entire lives crunching numbers and verifying the theorists work experimentalists are an essential part of physics but useless by themselves they could hardly tie their shoes without help from theorists experimentalists can sometimes be found working alongside theorists the whole can be called a laboratory or a master and his attendants what many people imagine when they hear physicist is unfortunately just a lowly experimentalist
  this universe is just a subset of math  it makes absolutely no sense to say physics  math when physics is a finite subset of the infinite set of mathematics
  math is only an approximation thats based on how physics works it has no truth on its own
  poor fellow do they even pay you for your phd seriously though    t a lucky motherfucker making good money doing their phd at a national lab
  thinking actual impactful research is either experimental or theoretical and not both    so what kind of work did you do mr theorist
  say this to my face nigger not online and see what happens
  false  physics is just a finite set of mathematical rules that are not even deterministic that describe a finite universe and weve not even fully described it yet  mathematics is provably infinite godel and as such no finite universe can be fundamental this is proven   this universe is a finite subset of the infinite set of mathematics  physics isnt even a priori like math is so again it makes absolutely no sense to say that an a posteriori finite subcategory of an a priori infinite supercategory is  greatherthan its supercategory  the statement physics  math is literally nonsense
  the reason i didnt focus on theoretical physicists is because they have no way to know if theyre right without the experimentalists our theories were perfect up until we realized that the experiments didnt agree again the analyticsynthetic distinction shuts that down you cant sit in an armchair think really hard and figure out what the universe likes to do so just like you were saying as to how the experimentalists are useless on their own so are the theorists    thats why i do math dont need people to build an lhc to check that 22  5 just check the proof
both theoretical physics and pure math require a high iq    any brainlet can get through an electrical engineering program i can tell the stupid posts in here are made by engineers

  i shitpost on /sci/
  i have a bsc in physics and currently writing a masters thesis in theoretical material science i originally wanted to get into the analytical nonsense you describe in your post but honestly i kinda agree that most forefront of theoretical analytical physics is pretty much forward thinking and really hard or next to impossible to experimentally validate with our current level of technology im honestly hating physics more and more and im thinking of getting a masters in applied math after i finish my current one    math is honestly much more coherent and defined than most other sciences which makes it that much more reliable and superior math is immutable its scope is usually defined clearly and explicitly in each field or branch no need for experimentation or validation no need for shitty half assed interpretations and other nonsense    math is by far the comfiest and best part of stem    took me a long time to realize this sadly and it haunts me that i wasted so much on my life on literal shit

  no offense but you are wrong only very rare chipsets use quantum mechanics in their design all the chips people are using on this paper folding community did not require any quantum calculations at any phase of their production what you mean to say is that quantum mechanical theory is used as a way to explain them its not used when you build them  source my dad works at nintendo

its pretty easy although since its been a while i didnt remember the terms in bernoullis equation presumably that would have been given with the supposedly enclosed theory part    maths stuff seems really simple
the human brain consists of pretty simple cells just following instructions  simulating these cells in a computer should result in a working human brain  a computer need not be made of silicon and electricity information could be represented just by some guy lobbing beer cans into piles on an infinite plane following an algorithm    my thinking feeling mind right now could technically just be a bunch of beer cans    is this something you have to accept if you believe machines with consciousness/qualia are possible /sci/
  no you are absolutely retarded
  the human brain consists of pretty simple cells  elaborate how the human minds cells are simple
  dont they follow the instructions of dna in a predetermined manner    of course synapses also learn to wire together if they fire together meaning that they get some epigenetic changes as well but these mechanisms arent all that complex the complex part is how they act as a whole which currently cannot be explained  im not a biology major though so feel free to correct me if im wrong
  the complex part is how they act as a whole  fair point im also not a biology major so i cant exactly disprove it but i somewhat find it a little hard to believe that the human brain can simply be simulated in a computer
  
a computer doesnt work at all like a human brain both can do similar tasks but they are not doing it the same way so the only thing you will ever get with a computer is an approximation you will never get the real thing
  the beer can analogy is like the assumption that a team of infinitely typing monkeys would eventually write shakespeare its technically within the realm of possibility yet its so far from reality it shouldnt be taken seriously what should is the obviously intentional design of it all its not random

  a note on autism      this genetic polymorphism causes calcium channels to be overactive and intracellular calcium to be chronically elevated it almost always presents with autism changes in cholinergic activity and chronic microglia activation are other common features of autism    if you look around these days many people are displaying low grade pseudoautistic traits    other reviews        its my suspicion that this increase in autism incidence with prenatal exposure is solidified by early clamping of the placenta at birth depriving the child of its iron stores and causing hypoxia as this is often done before full lung changeover thus its deprived of one avenue of protection from rf in the bone marrow and gut and to a lesser extent the brain though rf in general as it increases blood brain barrier permeability and alters the transport of free iron to ferritin will increase fenton reaction oxidation of various compounds so its a multifaceted aspect in this immediate postnatal period

you basically cant its become a tribalistic political view to conservatives their party has mastered the propaganda disinformation and sowing doubt about the science for decades now to the point at which its a political position to them you can point to the evidence yet it means nothing to the vast majority of conservatives only how they feel matters trump is the epitome of this trust your gut type nonsense that is entrenched in conservative politics these days     but keep in mind this is exactly what the oil lobbyist wanted they created this atmosphere and utilized conservative politicians as a vector to spread doubt about the science they have been doing it for literally decades as soon as it was realized that this issue would result of their corporations being regulatedthey have spent hundreds of millions of dollars over the years to achieve this goal and politicians are pretty cheap to buy

  nacetylcysteine acetyllcarnitine vitamin c e and d omega3 fatty acids as well the intention is to provide antioxidants deal with lipid peroxidation and support the glutathione system  make sure you have adequate magnesium zinc and selenium this is involved in calcium homeostasis elevated mg blocks calcium influx which is what causes the elevated superoxide and nitric oxide production which goes on to become peroxynitrite and hydrogen peroxide eat healthy organic fruits and vegetables a few brazil nuts per day  various herbs like gotu kola ginkgo biloba ashwagandha celastrus paniculatus etc  calcium channel blockers like phenibut and panax ginseng may be effective the latter has been shown to attenuate wifi induced hippocampal damage ginseng is high in phytoestrogens and should be used in moderation in men  proper sleep this means getting rid of all emitting devices in your house all fluorescents and leds make sure you have no blue light a few hours before bed and sleep in complete darkness no blue light no green light not even any dim red light as its been shown if youre not albino or have blue eyes the melanin in your iris facilitates transduction of power frequency fields and suppresses melatonin synthesis this occurs even with incredibly dim red light  try to manage stress i dont have any advice on this one  do some research and inform others    thats the gist of it
  comparing our gdp output to our emissions you will find we are one of the most efficient economies on this planet wah wah all you want about the us but china solo pollutes more than europe and north america combined
  optimized
  optimized
  how do you respond to these i cant seem to find any good evidence that the scientific consensus is clear on this most of the stuff you posted is non human though the videos are interesting        
  why are americans so fucking stupid and delusional you dickheads honestly live in a parallel universe your entire country is full of bullshit china tier propaganda and people constantly wanking each other off with made up statistics    you come in 80th place for gdp per emissions chunks of europe do 5x better keep gargling that nationalistic dick anon    
  per capita they pollute less and lot of international pollution happens in china as they are manufacturing stuff for us
  a single entry from 2006 wiki data  our 3rd worst year in 50 years  doesnt take into account great emission reduction us has had since 2008  reduced almost 1000 million metric tons of co2 emissions since then   also  be us  have more wealth than any two continents combined including asia  europe  subsidize the world in literally everything from tech to military to medicine  still manage to run the 11th most efficient developed economy despite having x33 more people and x320 more land than pseudo bitch countries like belgium who cant even x15 us on efficiency  if anything we are allowed higher emissions as reparations for having to drag the world by the hair in terms of scientific progress what has china done in comparison with their 30 global emissions build the 50 cent trinkets smarter men have designed idk why youd want to put red tape on the only country in this world that has the intellectual capital to solve global warming go bother china india russia and japan and fuck right off of us
cannot care to search for the surveys but the surveys do show that americans are vastly in favour of acting on climate change something like 60 to 75 there is also another survey that shows that politicians underestimate how much the electorate cares about climate change
  all your numbers are wrong nice try shill
  its not our problem china is a slave economy that runs off their human capital they also account for 51 of global coal pollution because their retarded inlanders still use fucking coal heaters in their homes
  look at your own link retard 2006 data   using a single data point to make an argument  are you by any chance a retarded maple bitch probably chinese diaspora
  any psychologist who is a woman disregard her opinion  nice ad hominem faggot also why the fuck you just cant write psychology or psychologist
  anthropomorphic climate change
  psychology is not a science  
   cant cope with emissions per capita   demands emissions per gdp instead   still emitting more than europe currently    leaving aside how bullshit gdp is in general do you want to shift the goalposts again   the us doesnt subsidise shit again more bullshit propaganda you idiots are fed screeching hysterically wont change the fact that no one wants subsidies and if you spent a tiny fraction of the trillions spent on wars in the last decade you could have singlehandedly fixed climate change and actually saved the world    china agreed to 45 reduction from 2005 levels and reached it 3 years ahead of schedule last year   the us agreed to 26 reduction from 2005 levels and wont make the target even by 2025    and all of this only measures a countries output it doesnt measure consumption burgers buy chinese steel yet the emissions are counted as being chinese     burger nationalism and prolific retardation that turns science into political sided issues will ruin the world at least china can get shit done you guys are a fucking mess      
  ew ew i know this one  tell them to pay a carbon tax so the govt can buy a pipeline and expand oil production    what do i win where is my nobel prize in economics
  he thinks comparing emissions of college educated contributing members of the world to those of cave dwelling peasants is fair  high gdp  high productivity  high net contribution to species i would gladly cull the bottom 5 billion to lower emissions they are a waste anyway     burger nationalism and prolific retardation that turns science into political sided issues will ruin the world at least china can get shit done you guys are a fucking mess   t chinese diaspora    be china  highest population for 5k years  what have you achieved in all this time with all these people anon  muh 4 great inventions anon  lmfao china is the most pathetic country in existence
  i love psychologists who are women
  such sensationalist news articles most likely paid for by the companies who want 5g should be disregarded without a second thought if they had any ground in actual science they would be writing proper articles and submitting them for peer review but they cant so they post their bullshit online on their websites
  implying the earths climate isnt constantly changing
  also see how neither of those two articles if they deserve that name even attempt to provide any arguments against ca2i you know the typical mainstream tactic sweep it under the rug and bet that everyone reading your propaganda pieces will be too stupid to tell
        so do i just wire in my laptop and put my phone on airplane mode at night  what lights am i supposed to use of not florescent or leds
  a hurricane increases gdp burgers could build a billion missiles bomb some random country and that would greatly improve gdp   youre fucking delusional mate gdp has nothing at all to with contributing to the species and im quite sure you have no clue what productivity actually means in the economic sense     he screeches hysterically but wut has the chinks done    bring 600 million people out of poverty in a few decades become world leaders in manufacturing particularly electronics everyone goes to shenzen if they want to prototype   undisputably at the forefront of renewables ai and mobile payments     ive spent time in both chinkland and burgerland the burgers scare me more from bizarre pharma ads on tv crazy dystopian cities full of homeless shitting anywhere they want watching people go broke from basic healthcare needs and mindless patriotism that doesnt question a thing at least the chinks know their government is full of shit you goys lap it up    meanwhile china is clean has ultrafast rail across the country and the easiest place on earth to make a million dollars its far more capitalist than burgerland these days    their life expectancy is rapidly rising while us life expectancy is dropping youre a washed out whore of an empire that will soon be number two and its going to bruise some egos
  stop making wrong predictions i guess
  top kek imagine writing this essay chinese diaspora like you are peak npcs if china is so great why did you leave then deep down you know its a monotonous shit hole
  manufacturing electronics  renewables  china is clean
  which predictions were wrong
   youre overeating and becoming obese  implying body weight isnt constantly changing
    anon you just got btfo he served you ass on a silver platter and handed it back to you he has a point china is strong and powerful the us is weak and laughably pathetic we cannot compete anymore on the world stage
  lol you dont even get how chinsy economics works they are the slave class to the american hegemony
  they own our factories they own our debt we are nothing we are at chinas mercy we constantly get weaker while china is constantly getting stronger soon china will be able to figuratively tip us over to collapse with the push of a pinkyno pun intended finger the whites will be finished
  lol china isnt going to do a damn thing until the people kill the corruption or some other happenstance deals with it just like america aint stopping crawling up the ass of all the shitskins until something is done with theirs
  comparing your body to a collection of organisms on a planetary level  youre comparing apples to car tires
  you shouldnt have responded and summoned the fucking nut  
  you compared two different things11  yeah thats how comparisons work retard    the earths climate constantly changing doesnt tell us whether the current change is normal or safe
  your weight constantly changing doesnt tell us that the current change is normal or safe fatty
  hey at least he responded with relevant studies even if one of them was literally putting rats in mri machines for hours
  anthropomorphic climate change  fake
  maybe you should spend 2 minutes checking that your shit is correct
  the majority of americans do take climate change seriously    its our republican retards that dont
  americans do not take climate change seriously for a few reasons    1 the biggest proponents of agw are the same retards who say there are 1000 genders but gender is also just a social construct their absolute lunacy about identity politics turns a lot of people off their whole platform many people myself included do believe agw is real and want the government to do something about it but the only people arguing for this also regularly fly off the handle when someone gets misgendered if democrats sobered up and talked about real issues for once theyd have better luck convincing the electorate agw is a threat    2 while agw is certainly a threat theres a large number of dickheads making a lot of money off it in sleazy ways fun fact china got millions of dollars worth of carbon credits for not building a coal plant not for shutting one down just for not building one    3 all the fearmongering needs to stop you need to stop fags like guy mcpherson who say well all be dead by 2030 you need to be honest about the problems it will cause emphasize how agw will exacerbate the current migrant crises
  rural republican retards do not take climate change seriously for a few reasons    fixed
  lmfao get real the chinese are too use to the status quo to ever fucking be a super power thats why the only thing they have progressed in is their population numbers in the last 5k years can you imagine a billion slaves getting ruled with iron fist by a committee of like 10 dudes they are the reason i believe in npcs even russia can take china on and i say this literally
  bringing up genders out of the blue  hmm  democrats sobered up and talked about real issues for once  how about corruption in the white house medicare for all reasonable foreign policy a tax policy thats not handouts to the rich seems like youre the one blinded by identity politics
  psychologists  convince  you mean brainwash    convince  how about you provide enough evidence to make your case and let the people decide by themselves
  china solo pollutes more than europe and north america combined  where are your toys smartphones computers solar panels  produced yes you guessed it china  still the us pollutes too much compared to the shitty amount of tangible industrial products vs the aamount of stuff produced china
  how about you provide enough evidence to make your case and let the people decide by themselves  marketing groups and propaganda fare pretty well against scientists when it comes to convincing the public
a journalist once asked einstein his opinion on a paper titled 100 top scientists agree that einstein is wrong     einstein considered it for a moment and replied 100 if i were truly wrong it should only take 1
isnt it pointless to even care now didnt we already pass the tipping point
  as its been shown if youre not albino or have blue eyes the melanin in your iris facilitates transduction of power frequency fields and suppresses melatonin synthesis this occurs even with incredibly dim red light  i have 100 bure aryan grey eyes am i susceptible i have flux turned down to almost monochrome red
  you will never do so    every global warming conversation ive ever heard or taken part is    warming is a threat to the continued existence of life on earth  that is a compelling statement how so   volumes and volumes of evidence and historical examples we need more money for research  that is troubling what can we do to stop this disaster   are even more examples of how the climate is affecting random person or animal now we need more money for research  yes i believe you this is a thing for sure but what can we do   are 99 scientists from around the world who are masters in their field coming together to convince you stupid americans that global warming is a threat why wont you listen to us  i have been listening and i want to save the random people or animals but i want to know what we can do   americans dont believe in global warming  what can we do   need more money for research  im out
  the tipping point  tipping point of what what exactly do you believe carbon dioxide will do    humans changing the atmosphere is no more or less a catastrophic event than trees filling it with oxygen in the first place nature will adapt and life will go on
/sci/chologists xd gottem
ban fossil fuels  ban private property  mandate a law that any citizen must plant x number of trees yearly or he faces confiscation of personal property and fines    a single government can pass these laws in an year whats so fucking hard
  this  open climate change article  ctrl  f nuclear  no results  close tab
  producing more power is not the solution using less is
  explain why
    climate scientists are observe and report tier its a joke because everybody else in science knows these are the kids that flunked higher math they cant offer a solution because that will put them out of business since they wont be the ones working on the solution
  it should only take one scientist to prove agw wrong
  why not just kill 6 billion useless eaters and have it not matter anymore for the remaining population
  no one ever told me we should emit less ghgs  why are you lying
  its happening too quickly for nature to adapt without causing severe harm to the infrastructure and ecosystems humans rely on thats the entire point    do deniers really not understand what theyre arguing or is the only tactic they have left misrepresenting the science you decide
  make up a story about a magic man who will punish us forever unless we dont use fossil fuels and then create local community organizations that enforce this rule under all circumstances
  because it leads to the thinking that technology is the solution to every problem when in fact technology is the primary problem and reason for this environmental catastrophe
  this desu charity is killing this planet i cant imagine how we will survive 4 billion africans with chinese tier pollution
  and how do you propose we as a planet do that within the confines of legal and ethical channels what sort of legislation has been put forward that doesnt get reduced to pay more taxes gib moneys what sort of recycling / conservationist programs have you gotten involved in and would recommend based on positive evidence of effectiveness     we have matured passed a point where we need to be told global climate change is an issue and we need to begin talking about what the person/community/nation/planet is doing actually doing not just wishing upon a star for magic recycle faeries to produce less bullcrap to both lessen the impact on the ecosystem and to develop ways to survive that are economically feasible
  youve got to weigh the good against the bad sure technology has caused many problems but it has solved a whole lot too    i mean do you think starvation wasnt a problem before technology when there were fewer people and everything was all nature and sheit of course it was people always liked fucking and they didnt even have contraception or even understanding of conception that meant that the main reason for there having been fewer people was literally just babies dying by the millions    that is exactly what consuming less power would do it would lead to increased poverty which would lead to more dead children  what is more important what are the priorities
  this
  climate change doesnt matter there are trillions and trillions of planets our planet doesnt matter    stop pretending you care about the environment you care about your own survival your environmentalism is selfish and you know it you just wont admit it    i hope we wipe ourselves out the planet will restore itself in a couple million years
  and how do you propose we as a planet do that within the confines of legal and ethical channels   tax emissions optimally and invest in nuclear and renewable research and infrastructure    what sort of legislation has been put forward that doesnt get reduced to pay more taxes gib moneys  oh so you do know about the solution thanks for admitting you lied    we have matured passed a point where we need to be told global climate change is an issue  apparently not look at this thread    and we need to begin talking about what the person/community/nation/planet is doing actually doing not just wishing upon a star for magic recycle faeries to produce less bullcrap to both lessen the impact on the ecosystem and to develop ways to survive that are economically feasible  we are youre just in denial eventually youll move onto the next stage dont worry
  how much did you hear about any of those things during either the 2016 election or the midterms because all i heard from democrats was orange man bad because hes racist/sexist/transphobic    how about arguing for things that will grow our economy and help fight global warming argue for expanding nuclear power building plants and mining for uranium will employ a lot of people argue for decreased immigration less immigrants means higher wages for farm workers higher wages for farm workers means less people eating shit thats horrible for the environment like avocados    you guys need to learn to frame your arguments in ways that are appealing to conservatives
by reminding them that unbiased observation is more important than emotionally charged fear mongering propaganda    fears that co2 increases can deleteriously impact temperatures should be scuttled as well co2 can only absorb a narrow wave length of the radiation returning to the atmosphere from the earth which initially absorbs it from the sun that wavelength is 15 microns or millionths of a meter it is a fact that the atmospheres 410 parts per million of co2 today has already absorbed essentially all of that heats wavelength the earth has to give therefore further additions of carbon dioxide can have no measurable impact on the earths temperature or greenhouse effect          
  higher wages for farm workers means less people eating shit thats horrible for the environment  fair poi  like avocados  next level memery my friend expertly blending truth with utter bovineshit well done
  dont project your nihilism onto the rest of us thanks      frame your arguments so that they appeal to conservatives  seems like conservatives only perk up if youre extremely tribalistic and fear mongering if both parties descend down to republican level then we are truly lost
  avocados take a shitload of water to grow and are grown in the most droughtprone state in the country california you know how fast the water table is drying up
  why do you care why they agree with you why does it matter what argument works on them so long as they reduce their carbon footprint you can hate brown people and still produce less co2
  right plants irreversibly consume water this is totally a plant species issue not an issue of water infrastructure planning besides everyone knows the meat industry is so efficient that every taxpayer must subsidize it or else our mcdoubles would cost more than 20   god forbid the consumer would have to pay upfront for the true cost very bad for business
  ok so why is the water table drying up so fast it surely cant have anything to do with the insane rate at which luxury crops use it nope of course not    id be fine with ending subsidies for meat as well
  what do you think is going to happen the old are living longer larger percent of the young are surviving into adulthood you arent going to get anybody to eat bugs just like you cant get developing countries to pollute at lower levels    well anon the us got to pollute as a developing country so we should too  well anon the us got to enjoy prime beef as a developed country so we should too    blah blah we are all going to die and i blame the liberals its literally in the name liberal liberal spending liberal charities liberal government programs liberal this liberal that
  maybe a few megacorps are pumping more than their fair share of the water table maybe they can simply pay their bribe and the epa looks the other way
  yawn    
  whats the dmt all about  ive taken it its one hell of a trip but why is it /x/ shit
  theyre pumping more than their fair share to grow luxury crops like avocados walnuts and almonds
    flouride  typical selfproclaimed skeptics such a refined attention to detail they possess  everyone knows those other topics have no merit i know so because a corporate media publication informed me so using ample amounts of ridicule in order to discourage curiosity
  true everyone knows those luxury crops have no real nutrient value more meat is what everyone needs
  we dont have to eat bugs we can keep eating meat chicken is nowhere near as bad as beef for the environment further beef can be produced more sustainably than we are now the use of better grazing practices and feed additives that reduce methane production can drastically reduce the ghg emissions caused by cattle farming
  the problem is the first world doesnt eat the whole damn animal which is moronic because the parts they trash are usually the ones that have the most nutrients like the liver and heart asians are at least good about eating everything from the balls to the brain    the most water intensive crop is rice funnily enough the most water intensive crap is what vegans enjoy like pistachios alfalfa and the retarded micro weeds they love to eat
   start your own thread you knob        actually it is our fault
  you do realize china was putting out freakish amounts of ghgs and thats how they hit their reduction target while the us is sig lower even today and its much riskier economically to hit its ghg target obviously they both need to reduce to near zero but using relativized measures to make the pissing contest more real for you is ridiculous
  we dont just toss the guts in the landfill they go to create pet food and other animal products they dont exactly go to waste plenty of people do eat beef liver btw youre right that its certainly not everyone but its not exactly niche either i live in a shitty little hick town of about 2000 people and even my local grocery store carries liver
  what i am alluding to is the freerider problem if one party anticipates somebody is doing their part to help solve the problem they are less likely to do something as well      we didnt force them to have 10 kids per family they could be japanese tier if they didnt fuck like insects
  political speech is divisive and has no usefulness on a global science board amerifat
  has no usefulness on a global science board  it does if you want to actually accomplish your goals think of it as social engineering
  hurr libruls cause denial cuz they wont pander  but it doesnt matter if we agree  then what are you complaining about moron
  airplane mode  nope thats almost useless it still transmits just less frequently you want a silver thread woven pouch to block most of the signal  either halogen or incan other techs spectrums are terrible for you however efficient they may be
  well i live in the city and mine doesnt which tells you more about the average consumption of heavily populated urban areas i got 50 brands of fruit yogurt but no intestine liver or heart     to put it mildly a little hick town of 2000 is not the problem
  this is why commidifying carbon with credit trading is essential    polluters must pay cost externalities
  see 
    do it somewhere else faggot
  it is already in motion and we havent even seen the effects of 20th century warming yet if you killed the whole 3rd world today there would still be a global catastrophe and sea levels rising the difference is that you could survive it and if you stopped emitting ghgs at that point warming would eventually halt though it wouldnt reverse for hundreds if not thousands of years you simply cannot continue to persist this way unless you reduced europe and america to much lower levels of population density
  thats interesting do any stores near you carry liver
  that would still require global level of trust which we dont have you just maximized the freerider problem to the global scale
  he thinks this wasnt always a political thread
its hilarious how last week and the weeks before when a polar vortex caused low temperatures across the central southern and eastern us all the climate change deniers came out of the woodwork to say so much for global warming like they do every single year when the same thing happens    now temperatures have returned to normal november temperatures for the eastern / se us and no one bats an eye right now its 80f where i live in se louisiana which is above average for this time of year but again its because of warm air from the gulf just like the record cold temperatures are from chilly arctic air inundating north america because of the polar vortex caused by a weakening of the jet stream which in turn is a product of climate change due to higher than average arctic temperatures     if it got extremely cold like it did last week and it had nothing to do with the jet stream / polar vortex and stayed cold for months and kept happening for years decades etc and at the same time we saw a reduction in summer / spring global average temps then maybe you could make an argument but that wont happen with what we know about global warming now     why is it that climate change deniers cant seem to grasp the simple fact that global average temps will continue to rise at the same time for most of the world its another above average temperature fall / winter so far everyone is so focused on the us as if its a barometer for the climate of the entire earth you have to look at the entire world temperature data from everywhere in order to understand the earths climate right now its summer in the southern hemisphere and we are seeing once again record breaking temperatures in parts of australia and south america     pic related shows conclusions from october 2018s temperature data for around the world as you can see the southern hemisphere is still seeing above average temperatures and europe had the third highest october temperature on record
  hey thanks for linking me to that post i quoted i would have missed it otherwise
  ethnic stores and actual butcheries which are far and scarce they are not convenient enough for the average shopper and not advertised enough plus people are less likely to buy something they have never tasted everybody i know sticks to what they can order at your average restaurant steak chicken bacon etc
  
  see 
  its time to try ideas inaction is truly stupid    carbon credits are a designed system there is no reason to believe it wouldnt work maybe you dont believe in energy metering accounting economics    if you dont think it can be done youre just ignorant get out of the way and let engineers get to work while you doubt everything
  that is exactly why consuming less power wouldnt do  holy fuck the mental gynmastics required to convince yourself of this complete and utter nonsense is quite impressive
  carbon credits are a designed system there is no reason to believe it wouldnt work  you dont seriously believe that do you
  youre that same delusional fuckwit who thinks we can fight climate change while expanding oil production as long as we carbon tax the shit out of everything
  you think putting a meter in iran is going to reflect the reality of the situation or is it going to reflect whatever irans leadership wants it reflect take your naivety and shove it up your ass china devalues its currency right in our faces for decades and have received zero punishment you really think this situation would be any different lmfao
  they do believe it theyre devotees to the toxic cancerous ideology of technofuturism and economics    convincing them that theyre putting the final nails in the coffin of the human race is about as easy as teaching a monkey to do arithmetic or more accurately of teaching evangelicals that jesus didnt have super powers
  how exactly would oil production expand the entire point of an optimal carbon tax is that it maximizes savings from reduced emmissions if emissions would not be reduced by taxes then they would be infinitely taxed
  we havent passed it yet according to that recent ipcc report we have 12 years until we do problem with that is china now produces about a third of co2 emissions and is projected to continue to increase until 2030
  youre that same delusional fuckwit who thinks we can fight climate change while expanding oil production as long as we carbon tax the shit out of everything
  that doesnt get reduced to pay more taxes gib moneys  fee and dividend is only gib moneys for the rich and/or extravagant most people would make money off it if the dividend part is done correctly
  no answer what a surprise
  strawman someone  they play along and let you explain it  just try to insult them instead  i like your style
  i like your style  no the only thing you like is infinite economic/population growth thats what gets you off lol
  how exactly would oil production expand  i dont know maybe you should tell me because it seems to be doing exactly that  maybe its something to do with politicians who say shit like this getting voted in by idiots like you  there is no country on the planet that can walk away from the challenge and reality of climate change  many in this room believe that a price on carbon is good for the environment for the economy and for the oil and gas sector  we need to show the world that it is serious about addressing carbon emissions and reducing them  no country would find 173 billion barrels of oil in the ground and leave them there
  i dont know maybe you should tell me because it seems to be doing exactly that  we dont have a carbon tax let alone an optimal one do you have an actual point or do you just have a tantrum every time someone mentions a carbon tax
  we dont have a carbon tax  ya and neither do any of the foreign markets you and your pals who want a pipeline to tidewater to sell oil to    look anyone whos done their homework can see that you people are either total con artists or literally delusional from slurping up your own coolaid
  psychologists  man made climate change is real  pure cringe to take climate science or psychologists seriously   also retard the so called scientific consensus statistics in your pic relatedand im talking the ones that go beyond that meme field which obviously is going to shill for itselfincludes undergrad wewuzstem march for sciencetier scientists who actually arent scientists just idiots who think they are
  no idea what youre talking about are you done with your tantrum yet
  ya and neither do any of the foreign markets  anon there are lots of nations with implemented carbon taxes
    your people are fucking creepy af  youre so confident of yourselves and your virtue while you stuff yourselves    the best lack all conviction while the worst  are full of passionate intensity  
  anon youre a fucking idiot who lives in a fantasy world you cant just fucking ignore facts like this youre no better than the retards believing in 9000 genders
  also retard the so called scientific consensus statistics in your pic relatedand im talking the ones that go beyond that meme field which obviously is going to shill for itselfincludes undergrad wewuzstem march for sciencetier scientists who actually arent scientists just idiots who think they are  oreskes 2004  survey of peer reviewed published research on climate change    doran 2009  survey of actively publishing climatologists    anderegg 2010  survey of actively publishing climate researchers    cook 2013  survey of peer reviewed published climate research    verheggen 2014  survey of scientists with more than 10 climaterelated peerreviewed publications    steakhouse 2014  survey of american meteriological society climate scientists who actively publish    carlton 2015  survey of actively publishing climate scientists    none of these include undergrads why are you lying
  wah wah waaaaaah  shhh little baby dont say a word    
  and im talking the ones that go beyond that meme field which obviously is going to shill for itself  no reading comprehension ability
  which is none of them so you lied why
  actually for republicans the more educated you are the more likely youll be a climate change denialist its part of the tribe mythos just another talking point in their faith
  take india for example theyre developing which means theyre becoming ever slightly more wealthy which means their health and quality of life is increasing  they have more money so they can buy more food    what is simultaneous with this development expansion in power generation unfortunately they overwhelmingly use coal which obviously contributes to climate change    theres two things you can do  1 change coal to something else  b just flat out refuse to let them use more electricity    not letting them use more means they have less light to read and educate themselves less to communicate less to engage in industry etc  since it doesnt do anything to quench their taste for fucking babies will still keep being born but they will not be fed we have the capacity to feed everyone they simply cannot afford to buy the food  suffering because of you
  whats so fucking hard  not wanting to live in a dictatorship would be the first issue for a western person used to a high degree of personal liberty
can you even imagine how fucking boring it would be on mars not to mention the trip there and back holy shit
  he has gotten thicccc
  hey its not marss fault that earth is the most interesting place in the solar system
  yeah and he also thought the hyperloop would work
  mandatory robot catgirl waifus for the maintenance of psychological health
  elon shouldnt go himself because hes the brains behind the operation
  the brains behind the operation  elon  being the brains behind anything other than marketing
holy fuck space nerds are so annoying     pic related is a decent take on them
  yeah man a whole new untouched planet that sounds boring as fuck
id go being the first person on another planet youre like a god the chances are whatever you do in life will never ever come close to as impressive as even trying let alone succeeding and coming back alive youd be a huge deal for the rest of your life much more than moon landing guys
  i believe him  
full interview    
  this show is for absolute brainlets
  hyperloop  look at this thunderf00t sub  hyperloop is literally just a runofthemill idea he had he never claimed it could actually work spacex holds competitions where it basically outsources it to engineering teams google and other companies do this all the time through xprize etc    
  space nerds are going out and getting shit done while philosotards spend all day coming up with excuses to not do anything ever which is the group without a purpose again
  working nonstop to build the base    this is actual bullshit human labour wont get much done their outside of your wellshielded habitat you have to wear a suit that weighs 70kg and drastically reduces your movement range time outside the habitat will also be regulated to a few hours a day because of radiation     and even if you disregard all this there are simply not that many ressources on mars to work with a mars crew will largely sit in their habitats doing nothing while hoping the life support wont die
  anon is right though mars is just a big ball of rust  there is nothing else there that is as interesting as earth
  well unfortunately all the land on earth is claimed with the exception of the poles which no one will be allowed to settle
  couple this with the low g and you basically turn into mush overtime
  literally 0 science to back this up stop memeing this gay shit without any valid evidence
  no  he makes far too many promises he possibly cant keep he has to prove himself on one of his big projects before i put trust on anything he says  hyperloop or underground hyperloop is just not going to happen his initial target for human space flight was 2014 and he says ridiculous shit like a fully sustaining mars civilization is about 40 to 100 years from now he has a lot of things going against him
  showmanship and sales are as important as any other aspect of an idea    want to do manhattan project  dont sell it well no funding or support    you can criticize tesla as a cult but getting people to install a charger in their home and all of that requires massive salesmanship and it was all necessary    are you mad that spacex is propagandizing big space exploration instead of being quiet and humble
  the rigour of that kind of life basically a military daily schedule as well as frugality and selfdiscipline hard work for alongside your coworkers for the benefit of your community would be satisfying at the least
  i think skepticism regarding the much larger scale politically dangerous and frankly logistically improbable destinies hes woven in the mind of his supporters and the general public is very much warranted the principle of showmanship applied certainly but at a threshold point like this concept will alter human subsistence patterns permanently we will link together biogeographically isolated populations seamlessly and circumvent and established mode of transport for the same purpose while creating new unforseen political exigencies that will miraculously all benefit or yield to the brilliance of this new infrastructure the faith in farming investment money and time for rd room to lay brick for a future of many shots at the moon is ludicrous or at least no longer promised in the same way ev propagandizing might have been
      yeah this seems like a runofthemill idea sure stop the fanboying your god has flaws
does the blood of the great khan flow in his veins
  derp    it is well known that microgravity influences different biological systems like bone and muscle as well as the heart and brain and it enhances cancer risk    pmid 11234026     inb4 nature is not a valid source
  you wouldnt have a very strict schedule or whatever you would sit in your tin can drinking your own piss and eating your own shit while hoping the life support doesnt go out you guys have a very wrong imagination of things it would be much more like living on the iss and guess what most astronauts dont actually want to go there a second time
  yeah thats microgravity were talking about mars here we dont have data for reduced gravity environments whats the threshold nobody knows
i see a 70 chance of being steered into a concrete barrier when driving a tesla
  what the fuck is a 70 chance you either want to go or you dont this is just an excuse to generate media hype and then pull back at the last second
  the trip there and back  back  anon i
mars  pic related went there several times germans will know
    thats what i was basing it on you retard the iss has a militarylike daily schedule and all work towards common goals helping each other out and keeping the facility functional on mars or whatever this would be amplified into a legitimate community removed from earth despite the environment and danger its the closest you can get to living as a healthy human being if youre from the 1st world
  he looks like hes been drinking a bit too much
  dude that guy went to snickers
  youre boring as fuck faggot
  you dont want to go there without a return ticket if you die on mars your soul will be stuck there forever
  every astronaut jumps at the possibility to go again wtf are you on about retard
  mine is already destined for hell anyway
ill quote one famous renowned scientists words on the whole humans on mars thing  theres nothing to breathe  lets leave it at that
  going to mars is quite easy comparing to what you need when you want to come back
  i dont know too much about elons project to go to mars but i think that the people going there are not suppose to come back
  it absoluetely doesnt its more like the schedule of a uni prof with doing experiments here and there plus a lot of work outs
  it has some advantages to have two way travel and it is not impossible
    there is where i read that there wont be coming back
going to mars  not living on the atmosphere of venus in balloon cities
nukes all of earths major population centers  blows up his factories  hops in his last rocket and jets to his mars base  nasa promisses to retaliate and bring him to justice with disposable solid rocket bossters within the next 60 years
  time outside the habitat will also be regulated to a few hours a day because of radiation    telepresence robots will work 24/7 and need operators to control them
  thats not spacex and mars one is a scam
  only watching what the people in that video say you know there is something wrong going on
  there is where i read that there wont be coming back  spacex plan is explicitly to reuse the ships so there will be spaceships going both ways so people will be able to come back from their colony at least in theory
  return wont be allowed because everyone will be scared shitless of a martian plague
  kek
why even send people to build a civilization have robots build everything
  how long could he realistically last    1 week    1 month
  i dunno anon farming the alien soil under my glass dome and having direct orders from the government to have as many children as possible sounds like a good life to me
  i believe elon is going to get defiled in public
  if i can bring my computer i would have the same life that i have here on earth the only problem would be the slow internet with 1 hour of delay
anybody i ask in my country is laughing at americans for trusting that conman    its very cringe looking at it from the sides
  his bfr stuff seems pretty farfetched right now yeah but falcon 9 and variants including dragon2 are extremely real
  why is he a conman hes just building companies and taking advantage of the current situations
  he gains weight when things arent going well short tesla
  his fit now this is old
    we can build some interesting stuff on there
  playing a multiplayer fps with your friends on earth would be a big challenge
  attention whore
  that is the brains of a business  without money it cannot function
    do not respond to bots
  underachiever
  im sorry you were late to the party to find out about this iconic not show movie
his idea of getting to mars on reusable rockets sounds reasonable until you remember rocket reusability does not work for practical reasons and is not cost effective in any way while also severely penalizing performance of the vehicle  the claims might have had some weight if he had a lot more money and involved proven engineering choices    i expect considerable size and feature reduction to his recently once again renamed starship rocket especially after the rejection by usaf to finance it preferring proven traditional designs and by doing so essentially stating the airforces views on the subject    i predict we will see raptor powered upper stage for falcon 9 and possibly larger diameter first stage also utilizing the new engine in the next 10 years that is assuming the engine proves to function reliably despite the highly experimental and complex combustion cycle it uses
hes still shilling  hes still this desperate for yous
  based
  thats what happens when you force yourself to be the image of a company try to do everything yourself and get less than 7 hours of sleep a day
  i was referring to the hbo show elon was being interviewed on not heavy metal
  uhm no they fing dont dude
  shillinig  musk has delivered enough to be taken seriously even if he can be dramatic at times
yes
i have some black hole questions    are there any good visualizations of the geometry inside the event horizon of a black hole from what i understand inside the event horizon all directions in space point toward the singularity so the singularity physically surrounds you at all times due to the way the geometry of spacetime is shaped in there i guess the problem is you cant see the singularity anyway since all light would be moving toward it not away from it but could you make a simulation of some objects inside a black hole and make a video of what things would look like in there as you fall toward the singularity pretending that you can see without photons    a related question  if light moves at the same speed for all observers shouldnt you still see light coming in from the outside that happens to intersect with your location even after you fall in you cant be moving faster than the speed of light so some light should still catch up with you right how does that square with the notion that all directions point toward the singularity since in that case you shouldnt be able to perceive any directions of space pointing outside
  are there any good visualizations of the geometry inside the event horizon of a black hole  a penrose diagram
  that doesnt give much of an intuitive sense of what it looks like in there
  it looks like this    just think of the curves in this picture as the line of the event horizon
  try closing your eyes maybe that will help you visualize the region pas the event horizon
  i realize it must be pitch black inside but objects that havent yet reached the singularity should still be physically located in particular places and should move in certain ways that can be artificially visualized to give a sense of what its like
  intuitive sense of what it looks like in there  intuitive doesnt really apply when youre talking about the extreme curvature inside the event horizon   timelike coordinates become spacelike and vice versa the reason why you fall into the singularity inside the event horizon is because the only way to move forward in time is to close the distance to the singularity you cant escape from inside because backwards is not a direction you can go in anymore because it means going backwards in time     nope as you pass the event horizon you are going to catch up to all outward traveling light that can never escape like trying to run up a down escalator
  
  watching videos 4chan gave me with knot in the title  fool me once
  what you dont like knots what are you gay
  as you pass the event horizon you are going to catch up to all outward traveling light that can never escape like trying to run up a down escalator  so then you really can see something in there all the more reason to make a cool visualization
   you  yep they look like calabiyau manifolds in the inside
    if you looked down you would see all the light that has been trying to escape since the surface of the star collapsed into the event horizon and beyond if you looked up you would see light that came into the black hole after you entered it
  ok so even though all timelike directions now point toward the singularity theres till a distinction between pointing directly toward the singularity and in the opposite extreme pointing as far away as possible from the singularity even though that direction still ends in the singularity but after a larger distance    if you look down wouldnt most of the light that entered since the black hole formed have already reached the singularity so that youd only catch up with light that fell in relatively recently or does light from the very beginning get stuck in there forever somehow its hard to wrap my head around the way time is affected by black holes
fuck all this visualizing is giving me a headache im gonna need some christoffel symbols to cure this
  also one thing thats interesting to me about this is that it seems like space literally turns inside out in the sense that normally if you look 360 degrees around you you observe an infinite set of physical locations expanding out into the distance whereas your current location can be thought of as a single point whereas inside the black hole if you look 360 degrees around you what you see in the distance in all directions is actually a single point     exactly at the event horizon you should see the entire remainder of all possible directions and locations compressed to a single line perpendicular to the event horizon accessible to you only if you move in that direction at the speed of light    its not exactly a perfect inside outness though since there doesnt seem to be any sense in which your current location which is normally a single point is spread out in all possible directions
  already reached the singularity  light propagates in all directions it can no longer make any headway going radially outward because it cant go backwards in time   its an escalator thats going down at the speed of light if you run up it at the speed of light you will never reach the top the best you can do is stay in place   as you are going down this escalator youre catching up to and passing everything running up the escalator at the speed of light   if you look up you see light that is traveling radially inward so light that entered the horizon after you is overtaking you because its running down the escalator
  is the metaphorical escalator moving downward at the speed of light or effectively faster than the speed of light the event horizon is the point at which light moving perpendicularly outward still cant get out but just a bit further inside the curvature should be even greater so even if the light ray were moving perpendicularly outward at the speed of light it would still be effectively moving toward the singularity but very slowly i guess so exactly at the event horizon there would be something like a frozen shell of photons aimed radially outward but held in place and then as you go farther in thered be something like a gradually accelerating waterfall of photons aimed radially outward but still falling in at increasing speed though i guess this would only be the case if there were lightemitting objects falling into the black hole in the first place    that view of it still seems like looking at it from the outside though if you were actually in there it seems like the curvature would make it look very different somehow but i still cant quite wrap my head around it
  consider that you would catch up to the light leaving your own feet and everything on your horizon would be a funhouse mirror of your own reflection
  consider that you would catch up to the light leaving your own feet  thats normal though if youre not in a black hole dont you also catch up with the light leaving your feet in order to see them it seems like in terms of light the only thing that would be different is that light thats farther away would reach you more slowly if the black hole is big enough for the delay to be noticeable and for you to survive long enough to notice it that could have some strange optical effects what im really having a hard time figuring out is the single point at the center geometrically wrapping around you somehow and what that implies for what the structure of space nearer to you looks like
mathematically how many different ways can the observable universe be organized before it repeats
  like atleast 7 dude
  it depends on the topology of the universe but a ballpark estimate is 1080 which is around 10801080
  what does this estimate entail all baronic matter
  a lot probably
an absolute fucking shitload
seems to me like the bible was kind of written by alien invaders sometimes who called themselves jews and settled near that arabian peninsula after all a lot of the stuff the write down does have potential scientific proofs if regarded in a certain context if this is true it would explain a lot of things also why jews suck so much and are so hostile
if this were the case i wonder how long it would take a humanoid species similar to ours who prefer arid dry climates to change the climate globally to one that suited them and create their own paradise on someone elses planet i wonder
one of my biochem teachers made an essay about a scientific interpretation of bible i cant remember the title but he published it and sent it to the vatican it had some correlations with evolutionary biochem and geology
my girlfriend just downloaded the lumosity app and it first makes you do a fit test by scoring you on 3 different games and telling you how you compare to other first time users anyways it says she scored higher than 98 of people in her age group on the speed match test she just had her iq tested in psych and she scored 140 so this makes sense but what point is there in buying the app if shes already better than 98 of lumositys users
  to show that iq is actually not an indicator for intellegence
  online tests
  it wasnt her idea to download the app my therapist wanted me to get it her results indicate that at the very least this app is good at measuring iq
  her iq test was administered by her psych professor taken on paper and timed it was a valid iq exam standardized by the department for students of the university and proctored by the professor of the class       luminosity fit test is taken electronically also timed and standardized against age level of education sex and occupation it compares your scores against the scores of all others who take an identical test also for the first time and compares you against others from your same age group
fugggg
  140 iq  uses lumosity  things that fire together wire together kek
  we are both insane id invite you to our dinner party but no one ever shows up im pretty sure the kids are dead
heres a shitty article i found       the important thing is that she took a valid iq test and the fact that this stupid little app also seems to correlate with her actual tested iq i guess if you want a dumb iq test you can pay for a subscription   im going to start finding a different therapist
tried to google it but found nothing related    how much thermal increase in a liter of water would a ordinary xray eg chest xray at the clinic cause    the ralative question is how many xrays woulb be required to boil a liter of water / to increase its temp by 1c    a very relative answer would suffice thanks a lot
  find out the absorption of xrays by water in  then put the power of the xray machine in watts and convert it to calories which 1 is how much heat it would take to up 1c 1g of water
  thank you a lot

evolution is real  humans who lived thousands of years ago are completely the same as modern humans and nobody can point out a single difference between an ancient roman and a modern person  pick one
  you dont get the whole concept of evolution do you
  but they arent contradictory
  thousands of years  evolution isnt that fast you fucking brainlet get better bait
  evolution isnt that fast you fucking brainlet get better bait
  specifically bred shit is fast no shit  implying humans are  get better bait
  dont think humans reproduce as quickly as wheat
  some of us do
  modern people are taller you are an idiot
  prove it
  op i assure you that this is actually not the prevailing view in human evolutionary biology many teams of researchers are currently investigating how different complex behavioral traits provide different levels of success in antiquated and modern primitive and industrialized environments there is a good chance that we are accelerating evolution and selection for some of these complex behavioral traits especially things like agreeability and intelligence       ancient people and modern people are the same thats why theyre shorter and have more robust features  t not evolutionary biologists
  we have different survival pressures now  its hard for people to evolve when everyones survival is accounted for and everyone has the opportunity to fuck    what will evolve most significantly are immune systems white people have better immune systems from generations of living in filth
  that ancient wheat looks way better than the modern shit
where did our water come from
from rain
quite a lot of rock in the solar system is hydrated all bodies with some way of preventing sublimation of water ice contain water in some form even some that do not    these hydrated minerals likely released their water as the earth heated up if planetary formation began within the accretion disk    ive honestly never heard a good explanation of the creation of the solar system though    i believe the commonly held theory is that the water migrated inward from the outer edges of the solar system within comets there were probably a lot of them in those times this is if the ignition of the sun removed most water from earth    im also not sure if the magnetosphere can pull water in from the solar wind a lot of water vapour would have been around from comets going near the sun     does anyone know if the magnetosphere would have been more powerful when the whole earth was molten
  from bottled water
  water is common in the universe anon
  it has always been there dont pretend like you need to care you wont exist for long enough time to this information to be useful so focus on something more important
  space
jehovah
  and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters
  its a good question and ive never heard a good answer apart from the leeching from waterbearing solid materials    another hypothesis was from early solarsystem aggregation of high water content objects like comets once the water is delivered and released into the earths atmosphere gravity does its job of holding onto the vapors until the earth cools enough for surface water to hold fast and accumulate
  grug left the sink running when the earth was spawned 6000 years ago
  in order to understand where our water came from you must first understand from where it did not come
  the firmament
  in the bible water symbolizes populations of people not actual water    and god said let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters and let it divide the waters from the waters     and god made the firmament and divided the waters people which were under the firmament unaware of god from the waters people which were above the firmament aware of god
my peepee
  ththe parts that arent true are just symbolism
  the catholic church has supported a symbolic interpretation of genesis for millennia only dipshit protestand christians take it literally
  symbolic pedophilia also
  no thats real
interstellar clouds of hyrogen and oxygen combining
whats their rank in math history 
  franceenglandgermanyswitzerland literally just because of euler
  i can think of more big german mathematicians off the top of my head than english ones or are you just weighting newton that high
  not really its more along the lines of a bunch of german mathematicians proving results i cant bring myself to care about
  1 germany    power gap     rest    anybody claiming something else has no clue
  england  good mathematics  hahahahaahahahahahahahaha
what about russians whats their role
  germany has contributed more to maths than france
    england invented calculus
id say france is pretty much on the same level as germany
  francegermanyrest of the world
  who is isaac goddamn newton
    1 tie
    1 newton and leibniz are individual human beings not countries  2 mathematics is not invented it is discovered     youre entirely full of shit
    important but simply not as important as the two flags in the op recently youve got perelman historical applications math for spaceflight ostrogradsky duplicating gauss results plenty of respectable journals and a corpus of workthe local math library has some shelves full of soviet mathematics journals it just wasnt the site of gauss cauchy poincare leibniz unless you want to be cute and retcon konigsberg to russia based on current status    toptier a math has always come first and foremost out of western europe and/or people or jews who came from that part of the world and who happened to emigrate elsewhere einstein and gödel for example
whats the better language for a mathematician to know
    both see         happily math is /technical/ and uses restrictive natural language in its exposition by humans i would hazard to say that an elementaryschoolknowledge and comfort level with both languages for the simple purpose of reading and writing math in either is overall better to have than total mastery/fluency in either just get your bearings on the copypasta words and grammar for expressions such as therefore we have setting the value equal to q yields and yes the dreaded let
  almost every important mathematician is either german french or ancient greek
    im not a mathematical historian or anything but im pretty sure the vast majority of people who actually give a shit about modern mathematics would have the germans at number 1 the ones that didnt would all be giving some meme answer about ancient greece/china/something
    ive been doing the effortposting in the thread thus far and i fancy myself a real historian of mathematics again i gave the correct answer here   you cannot deny the cauchy the villani just as you cannot deny the gauss the scholze the ethnic linguistic and local milleus of both france and germany as they have existed over the modern period are effective equals in mathematical output the stateless grothendieck those who moved around euler several among the goattier they all operated in this place    there are a few lowtier meme caveats in socalled ethnomathematics ugh that i can think of ottomh to lend myself credibility and without checking wiki before posting the mangarevans apparently had a sort of blend between binary and decimal number systems which predated leibniz i seem to remember a japanese mathematician who was doing things with matrices or determinants seki takakazu but these things only pollinated and bore fruit in that one very special region of earth    it bears repeating that jews are part not all of this thing is jews are smart
  lagrange is somehow counted as french despite being italian  as a country france is still goodish but unfortunatly very elitistic
  hi im ivan gorskyzhejiang im totally 100 american and totally not naturalised for my skills
  lagrange  he acquired french citizenship though id say its a legitimate claim similar to the legitimate claim that they have on marie curie if he isnt french then einstein isnt american
its ok theyll create the francogerman super state and become the true math overlords we always needed
  lagrange is somehow counted as french  maybe just an assumption since the only way that name could be more french is if your name was franco lfrenchie
has there been as much world class mathematics coming out of france/germany recently
  yes  see   remember that the french population is 67 millions and the american is 325 million and france additionally hardly gives citizenship for prizes
  what happened to germany
  france was honestly always better at maths but germany had jews like hilbert or hausdorff or noether and then ww2 happened
  arguing about a countrys math ranking is really retarded considering that most people dont know math beyond middle school level
france performance at the imo  first participation 1967  number of participations 49  gold medals 24 silver medals 59 bronze medals 113 honourable mentions 26    germany performance at the imo  first participation 1977  number of participations 41  gold medals 50 silver medals 100 bronze medals 76 honourable mentions 13
  the only correct answer
  gödel wasnt jewish
  who said einsteins american lol  curies closer to being french than einstein is to being american although i consider her polish
  a fields medals are a recent thing and have jack shit to do with math history  b having said that most of the us medalists arent american they were/are simply associated with american institutions eg princeton at the time of receiving the medal
  what does this have to do with math history you brainlet
  german mathematicians probably made bigger contributions during the 19th century hilbert riemann gauss cauchy during the 20th century the math coming out of france was a lot more important grothendieck serre     i guess in terms of contributions to math that are currently being used in science and engineering germans probably have the upper hand on the other hands the french had a lot more influence on the current state of affairs in modern 21st century academic pure mathematics
  wrong mathematics is invented not discovered
  cauchy  german
  israel   power gap  arabia  india  france  germany  england  power gap  grece    nobody else ever did any mathematics of note
  france is close other than that yeah
  grothendieck  stateless    counting grothendieck as anything other than french for this discussion is pure meming
im always surprised about how many great french mathematician there are you always hear about the same people again and again when it come to science and math most are german anglo or hoax like einstein
  idk if this is ironic but franco is an italian name
    iirc at present the french jewry is the thirdlargest in the world though theyre slowly fleeing like fleas off a burning dog what with all the muslims coming in anymore above i pointed to the european jewry generally as a font of math in addition to the native superiority of smart cultured whites this cuts across the frogs and the krauts part of whats gone on is where they choose to settle or dont erdos yes i know hes hungarian you dumbos just as i knew that gödel wasnt jewish despite the other guy  misreading me earlier the point is to indicate movement of jews in and around the continent and the world and we have a small sample size to work with but the general trend holds good         most posters here even the epsilons have an understanding of math which goes beyond middleschool level you are dumb and coping be quiet otoh your thing may have a point if you  which wasnt actually your intent when you wrote that post        you havent thought about it
  pretty high if you count all their jewish mathematicians    some accomplishments by jewish mathematicians were also stolen
  its the other way around moshe the jews stole others accomplishment like always
  euler is ethnically german
  who is isaac newton  who is andrew wiles  who is stephen wolfram  who is roger penrose  who is bertrand russel  who is alan turing  who is paul dirac
  incorrect    there is a reason why ashkenazi jews have the highest iq average of any ethnicity go back to /pol/ brainlet
  hilbert  jew
  dont you have something better to do wolfram
  implying wolfram actually contributed to maths  russel  turing  dirac    hilbert wasnt a jew  i get the impression i read somewhere he was raised by jew calvinists  but the germans didnt kill him so youre probably right my bad
although hilbert himself was not jewish he did have a jewish ancestor
most jews are stupid the 115 iq is a meme jews are fraud its in their nature doing scam and usury like parasite einstein is just one fraud among many
  idiot israel is not homogeneously ashkenazi and those genetic diseases dont make you stupid
  who is stephen wolfram  shut up stephen
euler knew hebrew so he mightve been jewish
  because of theology he knew greek too
  and not smart nor a great mathematician must be a burger
  it is worth noting that grothendieck is at least halfjewish so you have a redundancy with the last sentence
  newton sylvester hardy littlewood cayley hamilton whitehead coxeter donaldson green gowers wiles
  this man has a beard  therefore he is hitler  you are surely the greatest mathematician ever
not getting 100 skepticism and rationalism  am i a brainlet /sci/
  what am i looking at here
  post link
pleb tier romanticism 
     how much do you agree/disagree with the following statement   i would rather be given an expensive car than save the life of a starving child    that depends if i dont have any connection with the child or if my survival is not at risk then i will fucking get the car  but i cant give that as an answer because i only have 5 options to choose from    the site is retarded i can only give relative answers the test deals with absolutes
what does this mean
  lets compare
  thinking a trolley problem is solvable  imagine being this stupid
  weak
  get car  sell car  save the lives of thousands of starving children even if the original child died before that  egoistic
i wouldnt say im that spiritual
the questions were not well made
what
what a waste of time
  ie would a society where you cant divorce be better than a society without marriage
  i think the implication is a world without marriage is a world of hedonism promiscuity and lack of commitment and reproduction which is abjectly false a world without divorce is a world of absolutism its a pretty stupid question
  but it doesnt say cant divorce it says without    so you have no idea if this is authoritarianism or idealism at least beyond the absurdity of asking if no marriage is better than successful marriages
perfectly balanced
  that nihilism score  oh no
  i got objectivism stupid and hobbesian meh    most of the questions were dumb and my answers didnt come naturally
  forgot pic
  
  the biggest tell youre a brainlet is that you didnt get a 100 in pragmatism
give material answers to everything  higher in spiritualism  im a prude  still get a substantial score in hedonism
  mathematics is idealistic
  the biggest tell youre a brainlet is that you didnt get a 100 in pragmatism    idealism is pragmatism    if you set the bar too high of course we will never reach it but well try harder than if we had shit standards    let me ask you this if you eat somewhere do you want the cooks to have an idealistic 100 handwashing rate or a pragmatic 98
                  what philosophies did you get at the bottom
  r8
  theres nothing else on the page
questions seemed too vague at times
  interesting i guess it only defined certain ranges
  i forgot to look
  8/10 would build society with
  whatever works
tfw platonic catholic
  im    got objectivism and hobbesian
  absolutely disgusting
so how do i interpret this
  are you me
heretics
how am i
  the point is that both disjuncts are vague retard
100 moralist pragmatist absolutist rationalist spiritualist    im based
  stoicism monotheism
  got monotheism as my philosophy thats accurate but i also knew how to answer to get that result so the test is a little invalid
objectivism and hobbesian  pretty accurate ill read about these philosophies now
not like i had anything better to do
golden mean
everybody that gets a high nihilist score always has a high materialist and egoist score only proving how shit nihilism is
  same 
nice
aristotelianism stoicism hobbesian
scientism will not be tolerated
not seeing enough rationalism very sad
not surprised desu
  thats exactly the problem with any of these tests you cant put a blanket statement on everything
  yeah on some of these questions i could write a full book that would be a good test same questions but you express your answer as a few hundred page book for each question
  based
  we are not mechanical men
test has no idea what pragmatism is thats all i gotta say it being the opposite of idealism is so painfully wrong
  90 moralism  woah explain optimal government pls
  la creatura
  monarchy
got objectvism instead of egoism  im disappointed
  i only answered statements in an objectively correct way
  yep
        interesting how similar patterns repeat
  objectively correct  questions about subjective feelings  totally dude
  you are immensely based
  its really terrible test a lot of these philosophical thoughts are interconnected like i believe morality emotion and altruism have an evolutionary function which is selfish in origin where does that put me
  i see youre not a sith lord
  how do i compare
help
i felt a lot of these questions were too vague
wtf
oh oh
am i retarded
  i answered yes as in degrees of freedom but yeah not very refined question
this is what happens when your dogshit test deals with nothing but zerosum questions without providing additional context to any of the situations   will there ever be a good test like that or will we forever be subjugated to braindead mongoloids after philosophy majors who make garbage tests like these to drain personality data from idiotic people who take them seriously
  either choose strongly disagree or strongly agree because you have no choice  every other option is for the weak
bros
91 nihilist my boy thats good
  strongly disagree is the only answer for nonbrainlets
  i would choose strongly disagree
  this i feel like its way too balanced
  holy shit same
  retarded test a lot of questions are impractical in nature and a lot of other ones make absolutely no sense stopped doing it at   a world without color is darker than a world without order   i cant be fucked to answer 70 more dumbass questions like that and youre all fags for finishing it
                      b a s e d  a  s  e  d      begone nihilistic scum
i wonder how many answered that they would rather save a starving child than get an expensive car bunch of virtue signaling fake faggots if you ask me children are starving and they are driving cars why dont they sell their cars to save those children if theyre so pious
  genius sell the expensive car to savemultiple starving children
  i drive a 2002 celica that i gas up 5 times a year    i also study mathematics with the intention of applying them to help bariatric patients and dietics  not everyone is a materialistic hedonistic egotistic piece of shit
  not /sci/
  he believes in objective morality
  i dont need a car because im not a burger and actually have infrastructure that isnt only asphalt roads
not shown monotheism      this
  youre a retard
scientific research is more important than art and music  patently false
  good and evil arent predicated upon our subjective interpretations of them
if you got 50 in absolutism youre an idiot
  he doesnt believe in the existance absolute knowledge
yeah basically i dont have strong opinions
  agreed so many of them were way too vague for me to even formulate an opinion
whats your excuse for not being a rational sentrist and scoring 5050 on this pointless test    materialism vs spiritualism  recognizing the fact that subjective experience is different from the physical gives you about 5050 score  egoism vs altruism  putting yourself above others but being moral gets you 5050  idealism vs pragmatism  striving for good but accepting reality is what it is gives you roughly 5050  hedonism vs ascetisism  valuing pleasure over other things but striving for meaningful pleasures gets you 5050  nihilism vs moralism  nihilism is loser mentality plain and simple  rationalism vs romanticism  valuing objective actions but recognizing feelings are what gives things value gets you about 5050  skepticism vs absolutism  recognizing you cant know almost anything for sure but some things are more likely than others gives you 5050
  my dude
  what is the name of this
did i fuck up /sci/  not shown hobbesian
  sentrist
  why is nihilism so high am i autistic
  it also depends if the child is one of my people or just some nigger in africa
  these questions suck fucking ass
the virgin centrist    doesnt have hard opinions  well i guess it depends  iffy uh  its only rational  deliberates on many questions and struggles with picking an answer                                                        versus      the chad fundamentalist    has hard opinions  knows exactly who he is  either strongly agrees or strongly disagrees  doesnt care for others rationality picks what he knows to be right  5 minutes or less on the quiz questions are extremely clear to him and he has no trouble picking an answer                                    
i consider myself well balanced
  im pretty much like you hello brother
  im flattered anon
  centrism  sane  fundamentalist  pleb low hanging fruit
  too much rick and morty anon
573 spiritual  727 altruistic  538 idealist  739 ascetic  657 moralist  534 rationalist  542 absolutist    hmmm
  how exactly is centrism the exclusively sane one of the two
  as if chads would take this lame ass quiz
              those hedonism scores
  please die you fuckin newfag cock sucker
  note the hedonism score as well
  somehow a massive hedonist  how someone as serious as you should be buddhatier ascetic
  just goes to show that skeptics and rationalists are nothing but a worthless bunch of degenerates
wtf im a retarded centrist
  strong opinion for such a flimsy egoed fence sitter
exactly 50/50  is this why im so ambivalent
mfs bragging about having a high nihilism score congratulations you have loser mentality lmfao
nietzschean master race
epicureanism  hobbesian
  i dont understand which questions this quiz is interpreting as material vs spiritual i dont believe in spirit at all and it gave me nearly 50/50
  you can tell the quiz was written by a brainlet because this question is supposed by the author to be a measure of materialism vs spiritualism ironically the majority position among philosophers is actually compatibalism where free will is understood to be consistent with material determinism
  i see your nihilism and raise you moralism goodsir
is there any evidence supporting the thesis that dinosaurs had penises      hard alligator skin that would crumble if became erect   hard skin that would crack if spread to give birth from vaginal canal   no fossilized testicles   no fossilized boner   no redrocket cavity    its more probably that dinosaurs grew externally at a cellular level from a fusion of externally exported semen and eggs
  yes you can purchase some excellent silicone reproductions of dinosaur phalli online
  its not phalli its phalluses you pseud faggot you could even have said silicone reproductions of dinosaur phallus online and it would have been grammatically correct
  well you do appear to be an expert on phalli
  as an unbiased third party i declare that we have ourselves a winner
  it is settled as of december 1st 2018 it has been determined that there is not enough evidence to support the claim that dinosaurs did not have penises
  correct
  i stand as witness
i now view dinosaurs as sexual objects
  chicken are dinosaurs  chicken have cloacae  dinosaurs had cloacae
im in a firefighter academy class and i have a live burn where i go in and put out a fire in ridiculously high temps and in full turn out gear i came down with strep and it fully developed yesterday with a sore throat persistent cough phlegm and a fever i cant miss this live burn tomorrow or i fail the class anyway i can keep this at bay during my exercise i dont lurk /sci/ so i dont know how this board is with medical questions
  i would try slippery elm powder and marshmallow root power mix 1/2 teaspoon of each into water drink    for sheer cough suppression little works better than theobromine for vagus nerve suppression get some raw cacao powder eat a bit of it not too much because it is intoxicating
what if inside every proton and neutron was an entire universe and when we smashed atoms together we were destroying trillions of sentient life forms
  trillions of sentient life forms would be grateful for you ending their misery especially if all those universes had semites among them
  youre implying protons and neutrons are actual newtonian objects and not just scientific metaphors we use to calculate useful information regarding their relational properties
  i agree    dude lmao just permutations of spacetime
  unironically thinking electrons are just little marbles
  they would be protected by the outer shell of the particle do no fret 
  autistic screeching
  what if inside every proton and neutron was an entire universe  are 3 quarks and some gluons a universe
  dude its just a metaphor lmao  just a mathematical formalism bro
  that would be pretty badass
  reminder that this screeching behavior is induced by vaccines children that arent vaccinated dont do it    also im only 25 but listening to the irritating as fuck noises that come out of children today when they get in groups it didnt used to be that way main differences more toxic environment and lots and lots of vaccines unfortunately they got me with the hep b in particular but whats happening to these kids is just awful    so yeah you made your stupid little shitpost on 4chan now try thinking about the bigger picture behind it
maybe if they changed the name people might be less scared of it because they dont have the negative association with the word math  furthermore math comes from the greek word meaning that which is learned  this name suggests that math encompasses all of learning which is misleading since subjects not based on math like english can be learned this makes math seem more intimidating since it seems to be an allencompassing subject it could also be arrogant suggesting that mathematics is the only subject that is worth learning  if we call it reasoncraft or numbercraft instead math the name would be more accurate and less intimidating we could also call it numerical philosophy or a priori science
  people arent scared of it because of the name  a rose by any other name  people dont like it because it doesnt come easily for them they are forced to do it throughout their education there are right answers that they have to get and if they dont then they are wrong which induces anxiety if you already dont like it and cant fully understand it and they dont see a use for it if they dont want to go into stem  in the end you can call it whatever you want its not going to make a difference because the subject and the work is the same
  does the symmetric group on seven letter contain at least four nondisjoint but different twocycles organized on some random structure  yes but im not writing it
i dont get why scientists are so afraid of eugenics via gene editing what exactly is wrong having all men look like aryan uberman chads and women look like pic related
  because they were born too early to be part of it
  who is this woman person
  and women look like pic related  pale and ugly  i dont get it  what would be the benefit of that
  nope im white  just not a fucking albino freak
  arabs are not white
it would be immediately abused to create a mindless worker drone hardwired to work consume and replace your lazy ass
  oh nvm then
  perfect for someone who will be part of the ruling elite very soon
  enjoy your gas chamber
  arabs are european caucasians who colonized the middle east during the crusades
  the problem with gene editting is this every generation of human scientists have discovered that the previous generations of scientists didnt know as much about science as they thought they did therefore we should not edit the dna until at least that time at which we can become confident that dna is understood we are not there now even though all dna scientists have to say i understand dna to get their dnarelated federal pork spending  yeah oops  sorry we removed the dna that prevents cancer  five generations ago  sorry  our bad
can celestial bodies orbit around a black hole    if so for how long
  theres a supermassive black hole in the center of our galaxy and the whole galaxy basically orbits it so yes they can and for how long who knows
  if we were to shrink the sun into a black hole and not change the mass of it at all nothing would change except solar rays would not longer hit the earth
  and we would die
  they sure can   outside of the radius of the original body that spawned the black hole orbits are perfectly fine inside of that radius you get some crazy spirograph looking orbits that are metastable  there is a point that the space gets curved so strongly that light can orbit the black hole though eventually the light would fall in or escape  youd probably have to capture those orbital bodies though since the process of black hole formation super nova/neutron star collision would probably goof up anything orbiting that body before something fierce
if you get too close tidal forces wreck you  if you get even closer you are inside the event horizon meaning youre too near to escape with any velocity not ftl  otherwise youd be fine  it wont radiate much except from sucking up matter or from hawking radiation but orbiting is as stable as the earth around the sun  you would freeze to death but you would orbit
brainlet here but im guessing there would be resonant orbital paths available im not sure of the functional details of resonant orbits though    it might even be possible to find a stable orbit within the event horizon certainly you could find a resonant orbit within the tidal force zone huge amounts of free energy there    will we have to migrate to orbits around black holes to survive into the heat death of the universe
  you cant orbit a black hole closer than the event horizon youd need to be traveling faster than light any orbit not hugely affected by tidal forces outside the eh would be perfectly stable though which means you can orbit closer to the eh around a supermassive black hole  but yes we could migrate to a black hole near heat death to hold out longer if youre more interested in that go watch isaac arthurs civilizations at the end of time series on yt its fucking great
  we dont know if there is a black hole in the galaxy center in fact we dont even know if black holes exist at all
  the whole thread is based on the assumption they are real tard  if they do exist theyd be the best explanation we have for the center of the milky way
  thanks times one thousand youtube only shills short clickbait adspam at me even though i never click on any of it    /sci/ has been my best source of quality youtube videos
  family guy bruh moments part 5  youtube algorith is weird
    ay caramba you have found my hiding place    it took me countless aeons to create this black hole i had to eat mcdonalds day after day until i reached g64 lbsrelative to 10 gravity in order to force dimensional collapse according to my ramsey theory calculations it was very painful but delicious and produced most excellent sharts    but now thanks to your intrusion i must wait even longer for my skin to turn white go away
  no avoiding heat death but red dwarf stars would be the goto for living as long as possible they give off energy for life still and have trillionyear estimated life spans
  nothing would change  about the earths orbit  solar rays no longer hit the earth  wed freeze to death but thats not a big change
  then tell me what the fuck is at the center of the galaxy what else but a black hole could be massive enough to hold everything in the galaxy within its orbit we call it a black hole because there isnt a better explanation until we actually see what the fuck it is
  a trillion years is still only 75x the age of the universe today sad  isnt it kind of weird how little time has elapsed in the universe compared to how big it is if i had to guess based on no knowledge other than the spatial size of the known universe id guess that it would be trillions or even quadrillions of years old but no just 14 billion also its kind of shocking how old the earth is compared to the age of the universe its been around for 1/3 of the entire duration
    if its so big why cant we see it
  youre the center of the galaxy    because my whole world revolves around you bro
  for a more detailed estimate the observable universe has a diameter of 441026 meters and i have a maximum diameter of about 185 meters ive been alive for 30 years so far so to be about even with me the universe should currently be 7000000000000000000000000000 years old
  my diameter of the universe was off by a factor of 2 so that should actually be 14000000000000000000000000000 years
  far far thing look small small even if look many bigs when close close    thanks bb
  far far thing look small small even if look many bigs when close close  ughh i cant understand this shit imma just sleep instead
yes why not if the sun was replaced by a black hole with the same mass our orbit would remain the same
  heat death assumes   our shitty idea behind why redshifting occurs is true  there is no contraction  there is no multiverse    what a meme
  we dont know if there is gravity in fact we dont even know if moon exists at all
  you dont know his mother
  this is wrong the existence of gravity and the moon is proved by countless direct observations of these two there is no direct observation of a black hole although we should be able to see an event horizon but we absoluetely never did
  we are already orbiting one
  heat death just assumes second law of thermodynamics holds
if the moon was transformed into very small black hole could it be used as gravitational slingshot for rockets
  can celestial bodies orbit around a black hole  yes  if so for how long  indefinitely at least for a two body solution     outside the event horizon a black hole is just like any other gravitating body and orbital mechanics keep working the same way they do with everything else
  our entire galaxy is orbiting around a black hole so we are orbiting around a black hole for billions of years fortunately in a safe distance
we post interesting math and physics problems and solve them
find length ab
  find fx
find fx
  thats just sinaxexpbx for some a b which i certainly cant be arsed to solve from your picture
  slowly but surely these 3 circles get me pissed off
  that b isnt in the exponent but in front of e but im not sure if it matters
find the radius of the circle which passes through a00 b14 and c51
if you pass the last person in a race which place will you be
  math3sqrt6/math
  still first
this is the graph of fxy  0 find fxy
find length ab
  true    u wot nigger
  aboe/3  easy
solve for radius in terms of ab and c
  prolong b connect it to c on both points big right triangle connect prolongation of b to other point of a big right angle thus diameter
  anything from first to second to last
  eqnabfrac487oesqrt219sqrt7/eqn
    you cant overtake the last person because that person wouldnt be last then
  overtake / pass  lapping is a thing
find the area of all the grey circles  also why isnt anyone solving the questions
  i dont have a compass on me so solving geometry is a huge pain and these   along with the one you just posted are the only ones worth solving
  correct
   pi fracr22 
stop posting geometric problems you fucking brainlets
  i mean pi fracr22
  interesting
    math displaystylepicdotfracr22 /math    here you go
  i really want to know this
  gotta be kidding me
  thank you was too lazy to look it up
  how do people come up with this shit
  wolfram alpha
    where was the mistake i cant math tags to display correctly either
  cant get
  does anybody know the solution to this problem
  im pretty sure you are fucking right if the answer is anything else than this based on the information provided this question is retarded
  thats kind of the joke/trick of the question   at first glance it looks like it should just be the diameter of the circle but its actually  which is ever so slightly less 03324oe
  if you assume that oe goes through the centers of the circles that od is tangent to the topright circle and that every circle is identical then that answer would be wrong ab would actually be 09972 times the radius of each circle see 
  fuck that makes sense good point anon cheers how would one solve without numbers then or even values of r i would assume to let r equal the diameter of a circle which is equal to oe/3
  we should broadcast this in the direction of the wow signal at full power
geometry is the worst math subject  t math major
    i think its mathrfrac14423/math
  sure enough  see the points where the two smaller semicircles touch the big circle if you connect them the line passes through the point in the triangle and is parallel to the hypothenuse  mark the midpoint in the line and trace a line at a ninety degree angle it passes through the hypothenuse mark this midpoint big circles center  the rest is trivial i just really dont feel like applying pythagoras fifteen times over and again no compass so id have to draw things on fucking paint
theres no thread for this and i feel like a fucking retard for not remembering this but its been a very long day of working on assignments so my brain is burnt out   what statistical test do you use to show that the mean of one group is significantly larger than the mean of another
  that line and the hypotenuse arent parallel but almost are or if they are prove it
  
  sqrta2b2sqrt2c2)))/2
  sorry i dont see how that theorem is applicable
  any line orthogonal to a tangent line of a circle must pass through that circles center draw lines from the center of the big circle to its points of tangency with the smaller circles those lines must pass through the centers of the smaller circles split those lines at those centers the outer lengths are simply the radii of the smaller circles and the inner lengths are labeled a b c the sum of an inner length with its outer length must be the radius of the big circle this relation can be expressed as  eqnra3b4c5/eqn  rearrange and square both sides to get  eqna29r26r  b216r28r  c225r210r/eqn  next draw line segments orthogonally from the legs of the triangle to the center of the circle label these x and y the lengths a b c can be expressed in terms of x y by the pythagorean theorem  eqnbeginalignat16  a293x2y29x26xy2r26r  b216x24y216x2y28yr28r  c2253x24y225x26xy28yr210r  endalignat/eqn  this gives a system of polynomial equations which can be eliminated to obtain the relation  eqn3x2yr/eqn  this can be plugged back in to the polynomial equations finally solve for r and discard the extraneous solution  eqnrfrac14423/eqn
  we name the points of the triangle a b and c where ab6 and ac8 we name the semicircles abd ace and bcf where d e and f are the points of tangency  connect dc be and af we claim that the point g where dc be and af meet is the center of the large circle and ge gd or gf can be used for the radius  proof of the whole thing has been left to the reader
for what value of a does mathxaax/math have only one unique real solution
true of false zy is the tangent plane to fxyex2y at xy00    i got zy1 as the truest answer but technically zy is parallel to the tangent plane doesnt that make zy the tangent plane as well what should i put down as the answer i am taking an online quiz for homework points and i dont want to miss anything  also post more multivariable math problems anons i want to test my knowledge before finals
  ill just post free multivariable calculus problems for you non uni faggot anons
      solving multivariable calculus  for free  not fucking happening
  good luck
  i can do these anon i will post basic linear algebra for you to solve for your own damn practice  i only asked for verification on the autistic problem my professor asked for the other zy problem
  the world doesnt fly around you i was complaining that this thread is for interesting problems emphasis on interesting
  mathrfrac leftfrac68102right2  6810 1/math mothafucka  you cant touch dis shit  im on fire niggaaaaaaaa
calculate
  wtf how
  math frac1sqrt2 /math  right
  no solution since tangents to the outer circles coincide with the tangents of the semicircle every radius of the semicircles coincides with a radius of the outer circle    all radii meet at the center and the radii would therefore meet at the halfway point of the hypotenuse    but that point is 7 units away from the circumference for two of the radii and 5 units away from the third and which means the point cant form a circle
  its literally just an implicit differentiation calc ab problem but with gradient mathvertvertnabla z11vertvertsqrt29/math unless if i fucked up somewhere
  what do you mean calc ab your school must have been actually good to make it seem obvious  all of the problems were retardedly easy besides that one example shown
  this is for those who forgot their lagrange definitions
  how did you come up with a pattern
the left end of an elastic rope is fixed and the right end moves away from the left one at a speed of 10cm/s an ant is on the left end of the rope and moves to the right end of the rope at a speed of 5cm/s how long will it take the ant to get to the right end
the numbers inside the circle are the sum of the 4 squares around it otherwise normal sodoku rules apply    solve it and you can have nudes im fucking desperate to do this
  ahahahaha    setting aside the fag on op would the addition of certain conditions change the problem into a p one
  nice puzzle op
lol nice actually want nudes
  no fuck off thot
  obviously
now scram before i call the police
  but you came here first
category theory is one of the most powerful mathematical ideas of the past century category theory is a mathematical formalism that is an alternative to set theory the fundamental idea of category theory is the notion of the commutative diagram which is an extremely powerful way of representing everything that you would use something else for    category theory is amazingly powerful everyday i keep coming across concepts and finding that the most natural way to think about them is from the categorical perspective category theory is extremely general however even group theorists often regard it as abstract nonsense    in fifty years i believe category theory will be as applied a field of mathematics as calculus linear algebra or probability theory based on its usefulness and broad applicability however for now the main use of category theory is the proof of more results about category theory itself    category theory in many respects is even more appropriate as the laws of thought than logic for representing and manipulating concepts and symbolic representations of domains no other mathematical formalism come close to the naturalness of category theory there have even been papers which suggest that category theory is the mathematical basis of human thought and problem representation and solving capacity    i recommend for everyone here to learn category theory
its literally just fucking arrows
  category theory  not science or math
  its literally math the fact that you dont understand it doesnt mean it doesnt belong here brainlet
  its literally math  how so
  how is it not
  why did they draw a dick in math on the cover of their book is that really there or photoshopped in
  oh my god
  how is it not  the burden of proof is on you
  the virgin category theory vs the chad combinatoric erudition    needs no preschool arrows   doesnt even need a central reference point   instantly understands the hyperspace it inhabbits by merely presenting a dualistic object to invade it   conquers it completely through definition by proofs before transforming it into succint axioms of mathematical perfection  immediatly deduces relavant results and analysis from statistical discrepancies within the form functions of any inhabitted location  groupings literally become fluid in its presence  interdimensionally relavant    where were you when category theory got btfo
  why are you like this cant you just fuck off and leave our cats alone
  you see already in less than 5 minutes of my chad combinatorical presence you have already turned into a pussy chadbinatorics wins again
  i fucking hate you
finally someone else whos talking about category theory on /sci/ we need to push this so it becomes part of sci culture  im currently reading pic related  and before that i read algebra chapter 0 by paolo aluffi
  where were you when category theory got btfo  skulling on the river cam plotting to take the lucasian chair
  retard      this      arrows and objects its actually quite simple but people always try to explain it from the top down by using special cases from some other area of math as analogies      what the fuck are you talking about      theres a lot of category theory threads on /sci/ not as much topos theory
  why is there always one person whos like hurr durr not science or math    there exists more math than just analysis and algebra there exists more science out there that isnt pure im an analysisfag but if youre telling me combinatorics category theory etc are anything less than math and in the case of combinatorics anything less than black magic then you have no idea what youre talking about youre more than likely either an undergrad who wants attention or a grad who wants to aggressively validate their own research interests
  its probably the same person that is wasting his life trying to annoy people on an anonymous board    i believe it might even be the same person that makes those is there a scientific explanation for x stupid subject
  i sometimes post not science or math but only in threads which dont belong on /sci/
  is there a scientific explanation for x stupid subject  threads like that should be an autoban
    same for whats the evolutionary reason for x threads
  in fifty years i believe category theory will be as applied a field of mathematics as calculus linear algebra or probability theory  no maybe it will be the new language of math it sort of already is to some extent but the actual study of category theory will remain a fringe subject just like the study of set theory is today    category theory in many respects is even more appropriate as the laws of thought than logic  what does that even mean 
ahem  fuck category theory and fuck algebraists
  you can like more math than just analysis you know
  good
  the actual study of category theory will remain a fringe subject just like the study of set theory is today  why are they niche subjects
  in the case of set theory because a lot of set theory involves studying the combinatorial properties of very large cardinals whereas most mathematicians will rarely need cardinals larger than n r or 2r  now of course i was caricaturing a bit for effect there are nontrivial applications of set theory to analysis dynamics operator algebras etc but i and i am not alone have this distinctive feeling that the problems that set theorists are interested in even when they have to do with mainstream math are somewhat orthogonal to the preoccupations of normal mathematicians  logicians are always a little off they are to normal mathematicians what mathematicians studying mathematical physics are to physicists
  how is it not  categories are not mathematical objects
  categories are both homes to mathematical objects and mathematical objects themselves 
  all math that isnt analysis is either philosophy logic so still respectable or fucking shit algbra playing with silly little toys and making unstable towers out of childrens building blocks or le ebic meme number theory autism reddit math  analysis on the other hand based and redpilled
  baked and gaypilled
   what is analytic number theory   what is arithmetic combinatorics   who is terence tao
    cats are most powerful among all wizards of the tools of mathematics d
haha i can make the shape of a peepee with arrows and get away with it
  analytic number theory is ok even if its a bastardization of analysis for a discrte object of study  arithmetic combinatorics like all other number theory is a meme and the people who study it belong on reddit
  objects  if you are doing cat theory with objects you are missing the point all you need is a collection of arrows and a collection of triplets of these arrows which satisfies some conditions to represent composition 3rd arrow is the composition of the first 2 and a subcollection of the collection of arrows to represent identity arrows
  ok
  there are lots of semantics you can apply to a category only a pretentious undergrad would argue that objects have no use its like arguing for a logic without predicates actually though google categorical logic
  it has a use as a derived thing not as a fundamental thing like arrows are
  whatever enjoy having fucked up convoluted definitions for basic category theory concepts retard
  o no i have to define objects in terms of arrows before continuing with them once
  stfu there is no correlation between science and illiusion     we only say this to demoralize you so youll never try and make this association again thus ensuring we have market monopoly
what practical applications does category theory have none disregarded      underrated
he thinks this is base reality   believes that it has any significance at all
is there a drug that increases crh production i have secondary adrenal insufficiency syndrome which also means addisons i feel so tired all the time i want to have my own cortisol levels increase so is there a drug that increases crh production couldnt find anything online
  caffeine    it has to do something with its breakdown for sure
  get away from wireless devices and fix your gut theyre the source of your adrenal fatigue    fun fact wifi et al causes the upregulation of corticotropin releasing factor long term and with systemic inflammation your body eventually stops bothering
  i have a healthy diet and wifi isnt not an option not at home not school or businesses and i dont see how it would have anything to do with anything biological especially at the wattages in wifi    also i dont know what my cry levels are but they might be very low which is why my acth is so low my morning cortisol was 5 pg/ml
  i have a healthy diet  maybe pathological processes can still be building or existing in the gut for other reasons    and wifi isnt not an option  now imagine i told you to stop eating lead look i get its a pain the ass but the simple truth is you need to stop being poisoned or youre going to stay sick and worse because it does get worse when your adrenals fail your digestive system is often next in line    and i dont see how it would have anything to do with anything biological especially at the wattages in wifi  im too tired to explain has to do with changes in calcium flux among other things    refer to        and    
as an assignment for university i have to give a detailed description of the manufacturing steps from the api to the selected tablet dosage form  process steps conditions and equipment of a specific drug glucotrol     where the fuck am i supposed to find this information though
  just drop out

  damn how did you find that that is pretty much exactly what im looking for but it is for the extended release version of glucotrol whereas i just need the standard version thank you though
is data science a meme or is it /sci/ approved
  if it yields money it is a science
like everything else 90 of it is shit
  same as meme learning most of it is a meme
why not just call it applied statistics instead of that meme shit meme name
  because people with stats degrees cant write code
    if it yields money its capitalist shit science is inherently a selfish field and if the field revolves around money its not science
            if they attended a shit school sure
  there are two parts  1 marketability to companies  2 data science being a much looser concept than statistics  lets mine for spurious correlations in this yuuge dataset and do some random clustering
roughly 85 of solo travelers are women how does biology influence men and womens travel behaviour
these are some suggested reasons by women    women are more adventurous than men   women prefer being alone more than men
  feminism ruined western men western women travel to find men that havent been ruined yet by western women  also protip from a guy who used to do lots of backpacking around the world your gf is cheating on you when she goes on one of these trips yes even the sweet innocent looking ones cant help but laugh at how many of these girls were engaged to some hopeless tool back home but romping around with locals and fellow backpackers all trip long women crave masculinity which is getting rarer all the time in western men
  if travel is masculine then therefore women are more masculine and aiming to do masculine things     i dont think travel is masculine in itself buying a ticket getting to the airport arriving at the destination what is masculine about that
  its not biology its economics  men are to busy working and women earn less because they spend more time complaining about equal pay and traveling
  all women are whores who arent mature enough or capable of settling down and doing what they were made to do have children
  you missed the point they are traveling to find masculine uncucked men this is of course delusional because literally every single type of man except afghan tribals and the like are cucked
  men studyworks and marry women just marry and travel incremental probability good marriage    yes you get 9 to 5 workday and she just waiting to marriage    but usually men travel way more for bussiness or work
  sort of true the parody of masculinity exhibited by third world men is enough to fool women into being attracted to it as their only point of comparison is feminized western men
  i agree most third worlders are nothing like afghan tribals
    plz be bait
  certainly in the places women travel bungee jumping in ecuador or getting drunk on wine in italy are the types of adventures women travelers are into its adventure with training wheels that rarely come off the local zip line operator in some banana republic makes most of his compensation in access to sex with first world women rather than through money
  this is /sci/ present evidence to refute the hypothesis if it is to be easily dismissed
  good post particularly like the subtle implication of italy being third world
  women are more about experience men are eventually more about control female progress is usually an inner journey male progress is usually power over the external
  because they want to be sluts without being found out
  more adventurous  more comfortable on their own  restrictive life offers a break    lmao i knew most women projected but come on
  half the third world has immigrated there so it might as well be
  thats absolute bullshit you have no idea what youre talking about all the women i know who travel around the world including my mother are not on a quest to find an uncucked man theyre on a quest to find themselves
  this women who want uncucked men generally try to import them
    ok youre bait thank god
  western women rather sleep with a zip line operator than pay a few dollars for the fair    this is what poltards actually believe
  this is an interesting question and im disappointed op hasnt gotten more serious answers    first of all i doubt selfreporting by people is going to tell you much youll probably get meme answers like well i wanted to discover myself )))    women especially attractive young women have a much easier time meeting new people because everybody likes them socializing is just a lot more rewarding    there are some women ive spent time with who evoked such positive responses from people around them that it felt like they were living in a kind fantasy world that is just alien to men where everyone whether its a cashier or a colleague or just someone they sit next to on the bus is happy to see you all the time as a dude i can be pretty amicable and get friendly responses but she was just on a different level she wasnt even that pretty just young and she smiled a lot
have you ever traveled to any foreign country alone
  probably because people will pay for it parents will pay for their cute daughter to waste a year walking around paris boyfriends/exs will sometimes be so beta that they still fund the girls private trips husbands pay for it after the divorce and when they get to these countries all the locals will pay for their drinks/dinners and maybe even help get them somewhere to stay    the main reason you dont see men pulling this shit is that they are expected to work
  im a young guy people are the same with me unless i frown
  i smell bullshit women cant spend more than a few hours alone without freaking out and calling their girlfriends to go get a starbucks
  how many women do you know    most of my experience nonsexual is with older women and none of them are like that
  women prefer being alone more than men  doubt
  and my mother cheated on my father her husband during their honeymoon in france    what was your point again
  ive had a dozen or so female housemates when i was at uni and literally all of them hated spending time alone so they often studied together even when they were doing different subjects then theyd all go out partying to reward themselves
    it has nothing to do with biology as it does propaganda aimed at them to encourage traveling as a hobby people arent just born wanting to see the world no the media they consume consistently tells them that traveling and sowing their wild oats is what will make them happy in the long run despite all statistical evidence proving exactly the opposite
  hi roosh
i think the fact men need to establish themselves as successful and that requires savings and consistent employment might be the real distinction     you save more by not travelling thats the black and white of it so a mans priority is to save money    backed by evidence       in every savings category we could come up with men have tipped the savings scale when pitted against womens savings habits
  its about power and control men are supposed to be the providers and a mans idea of progress is having more security and control over his life a woman desires security but she knows she can get it elsewhere and so shes more about experience and progress via the inner journey
  men are working
  the inner journey    a bigger meme has never been invented by marketers to encourage people to spend money unreal
  so youre saying women are more susceptible to advertising
  women are hedonists
      women spend more than men and it is empowering fulfilling and therapeutic  men on the other hand prefer to stick to the basics and shop what is necessary they know what they want and rarely change their minds at the point of purchase be it any occasion or everyday wear they are easier to convince and can shop faster they are not willing to spend much time and effort on shopping  yes likely relates to biology in that women are encouraged to follow than to lead and theyre encouraged to consume by mass media which runs almost exclusively on consumption advertising
  yall is dum  here is what happened    women are more inclined then most men to pay attention to social pressure  feminism is a force in western culture  feminism provides social incentive for women to be individualists  this affects social media culture which affects individual women  social media culture spreads ideal of empowered woman  empowered women should be independent adventurous and have their finances and social lives completed and ready to leverage for fun by about 25 yoa    individual girls see this shit and feel like shit because this is an unattainable ideal  becky puts tens of thousands of dollars worth of plain tickets on her credit card shell pay the debt later she thinks  traveling and taking pictures to contribute to social media is proof to her in group that she is socially financially and emotionally excellent  becky is ideal woman feminist    the end     this is not positive or negative but you should always ask a significant other about debt before you get legally committed and definitely have a prenup
  ubermensch attempted attainment i think thats a strong theory     relates heavily to what was posted earlier about being more susceptible to advertising thus spending more saving less
  uberwomensch rather
  thanks for complimenting my theory
  only the shallow fall for it
  i was going to say they must enjoy it to repeat the action but then i remembered they hate work and they keep ddong that     they really do just do what theyre told is uberwomensch behaviour even if they dont like it     why millennial women are 2 x more likely to be depressed than millennial men    
  yeah i dunno maybe they do really enjoy it but the credit card debt stresses them out    because theres very few millennials earning enough to travel regularly
  these are some suggested reasons by women  believing a single word out of a womans mouth
  it was pretty clearly presented to us because he thought it was funny bro
  why are women naturally prone to extreme dishonesty concerning their own motivations and desires theyre not lying they really do twist things around in their mind and mostly believe their own obfuscations and excuses it makes sense from a survival standpoint in a way    worth noting is that repeatedly drawing attention to it and deconstructing these tendencies assuming the woman doesnt remove you from her life will eventually break her of this tendency so its not that women are incapable
  lot of guys are like that too
  true
        i think these things are related women in general are more approachable so socializing is easier and more rewarding for them in a sense this makes them dependent or even addicted to other peoples approval theyre always looking for their next hit socially    as a young man socializing is less rewarding because you havent proven your worth and as the stronger sex youre generally less approachable the flip side is that youre not as addicted to other peoples approval which also means youre less susceptible to advertising and peer pressure
  to get dicked on different continents in an attempt to fill the void inside
  theyre just giving the answers that they think theyre supposed to say
  because biologically they cant afford to have loyalty or commitment they might at any moment be carried off by a raiding tribe and all the men of their tribe killed so they need some way to rationalise shifting loyalty to whomever is the strongest thus they become very good at doublethink
    more comfortable being alone    then men i find that hard to believe
  this comment makes me think that you arent educated and you probably doubt the value of a formal science education   am i right
  your mommy is a slut sorry youre in denial get out of the basement and see the world youll find out the truth isnt what women say it is
  i found this statement to be true
  feminism and jewish propaganda it isnt normal for women to travel outside of the safety of their peopel    after years of brainwashing little do these sluts realize but theyre not going to end up with eat pray love but rather raising a cat of mulatto mistake the rest of their lives before dying alone
  phd in pure mathematics algebraic geometry and semidefinite optimisation
  quest to find themselves    literally the sluts way of saying im still riding the cock carousel your father should probably get a paternity test not that its needed because only a compete cuck would allow his woman to travel alone
  including my mother  lmao so we heard
  this makes me think you reject evolutionary biology and the role of history because contemporary marxism taught you to do so
  friends dating a hot med student  shes going on constant holidays by herself or with girls overseas  tell friend this no good  friend simps out  ok lolmpeg   she tells friend she cheated  he forgives her  she dumps him anyway later     based
  that makes me think you got your politics from youtube    which confirms my suspicion that youre a fucking dummy l m a o
  yeah its me who gets their ideas from shit youre the one who ignores evolution go pray to a feminist icon fag
  ah an autist
  go suck sargons dick ya fucking preteen you dont understand evolution you keep confirming it with your dipshit 4chan comments     i am surprised you are this dumb i cant imagine how id live if i was as stupid as you i might have killed myself by now if i was as retarded as you i sort of cant believe it youre like amazingly stupid its impressive how dumb you are i bet you have a really hard life but i dont feel bad for you because you deserve it for being so fucking stupid     the best part is you know im right and youre going to respond with anger or if youre really really dumb you might think im mad or butthurt but im just trying to drive my point you are dumb through your thick fat skull
  ad homs  ignores history  ignores histories influence on evolutionary biology    mentally ill reddit poster nazi faggot
  yeah that was an ad hom i was ad homming that you are fucking stupid hahaha someone babby talked to you about fringe evpsych and you decided to base your worldview off of it    thats a very dumb thing to do also i can just tell from your posts that youre really stupid and im enjoying the catharsis from my normal polite life in telling you what a fucking retard you are normally id probably have to coddle you and hold your hand and walk you to the right answer and comfort you after you fuck up on a really easy test or something but on here i get to tell you what a fucking dipshit retard failure you are
  im male but i thought i would find the means if i was somewhere else and therefore someone else or no one i did a lot of traveling on foot eventually i slummed around like a homeless person used my last 1158 to take a bus to boston after walking 23 miles carrying a decent amount of weight in a backpack it was the dead of winter sex wasnt in my mind and i dont know if there was a context where i would have accepted it but id probably be too distrustful of anyone i didnt know    i wanted to go to venice britain russia etc never got to it i think people are incorrectly assuming that getting some d is a primary driving force in the traveling behavior implicitly most of human motivation is about power and mating but there are other personal journeys whether or not someone would go for some sex along the way is another matter
  dummy
  women go travelling because of boredom and because its currently the trendy thing to do
  t brainlet
  men know theyre supposed to look inward to find themselves
    the alchemist  referring to the processes in the book  buried treasure in christian church
  by what stats and country
  yes im sure many of us seem like brainlets to you you have a beautiful mind were all very proud of you
  seething brainlet nazi
  yes yes continue writing on windows like theyre white boards 
  every legitimate logical point exists above you ignored it because youre a nazi brainlet stop posting
  youre making great progress at understanding facial expressions but i think its a little bit difficult for you over this anonymous image board i actually recommend that you be the one who stops posting     not surprising that a pure math grad has a loose definition of logic either lmao
  a woman in a foreign place without a penny to her name can easily find a man to rely on   a man in a foreign place without a penny to his name can easily find a street to die on
  hello and welcome to 4channel fellow redditor
my girlfriends friend recently went to new zealand alone 19 years old blond etc she asked my girlfriend and one of their mutual friends their opinion if she should start being a escort while there
i never met a loves to travel girl who wasnt a slut its almost a euphemism for the act now
  birds of a feather my man you are the company you keep re your girlfriend
  the real answer is that women got a lot more free time on their hands men work women dont especially nowadays that they refuse to have children or are very quick to drop them off somewhere to have some solo time
    should add she left her loving boyfriend for this aswell    my best female friend who i have known all my life went alone on tour in asia a few years back she and i have very open conversations about sex and she was with about 10 different men while there        girlfriend was robbed of her early teenage years due to a disease and anorexia she is not very sexually engaging without encouragment and very insecure also a conservative there is a higher risk that i cheat on her than she on me with regards to the company we keep
  men who think women arent having tons of sex while traveling are men who have never traveled themselves no a business trip to cleveland doesnt count though hotel bars are notorious pickup scenes anyone who has stayed at a hostel can easily see all the girls are hooking up and most have a guy back home who is clueless about what shes up to
  this fucking thread 100 posts about how all women are sluts when in reality 60 of the women who answered in that poll are 55 and older not even 2 of the respondents are under 25 source        didnt know /sci/ was so pol and incel infected stay class /sci/
  who fucking hurt you
  also now that i think about it the most likely explanation why so many elderly women are travelling alone is because their spouses are dead
  implying postmenopausal women arent sluts    their husbands dont fuck them anymore and they can fuck all they want without having to use condoms and birth control
  that doesnt explain why most solo travelers are women though
  thats a blog ran by elderly women mainly for elderly women doing a survey among its readers thats probably all there is to it     id say out of personal experience than at any hostle in the world there are always bunch of guys that travel alone while women travelling alone are extremely rare
  you cant be this stupid     largest group of suicide is older men since they usually kill them selves after the spouse dies whereas older women dont guess were the weak ones at the end
  i would travel alone if i ever traveled as a male hominin
    how does biology influence men and womens travel behaviour    when unfuckable men want to fuck they go to prozzie and all is well and good some get their m8s and cheerfully fuck sluts in fkk clubs or degradate young girls and boys in pattaya     this is normal and ok    when unfuckable woman wants to fuck she goes batshit because how can she fuck when her mom and grandma is around     so they just go on solo cockadventures in hope to get raped somewhere in the wild if they succeed its ok if they dont they repeatedly try and try again going into bigger and bigger shitholes where starved goatfuckers never seen woman in their life
      god must have stuck his ethereal dick in your head when you were a babby jesus christ youre an angry little retard  inb4 im just trolling pretending to be retarded  kk enjoy your upboats you sad little femme
  women prefer being alone more than men  as a man who averages 2 hours of direct human contact per week i really doubt that a female in my position wouldnt have a mental breakdown or something males are far more able to be alone for extended periods of time from my experience
  women can live alone their entire life and be fine men are nothing without a woman
  that is a complete bullshit neither part can live completely alone and its not beneficial for any sex to live completely alone
  women can tolerate loneliness better than men deal with it
  t butt hurt roastie  a lot of famous men were virgins like good ol newton and nietzsche i cant even think of a woman who has ever contributed anything let alone a woman without a man behind her
  got any proof which isnt just you coping
  nietzsche literally bitched his whole life about being lonely and not having a woman and  newton was probably into little boys women can live their entire life after their husband has passed away just fine men are helpless without their woman they either stumble upon themselves to remarry asap or fall into depression and commit suicide as anon said 
    using biology to explain the behavior of human males and females is unscientific
  youll see for yourself once you grow up
  man in tribe has malaria can barely move  brought to witch doctor by brother and sister  why is this person sick  his spirit is passing to the other realm i must begin the incantations
    give me one reason this is true thats not anecdotal
  women are soulless retards who survive off of handouts in a vegetative stupor  men can actually experience extreme trauma from romantic loss  hehe women are so hardy and individualist thats why theyre significantly more likely to be submissive worship the state and attend religious services
          imagine being so sad and lonely that this is all you do all day same fagging on a elon musk fan page to try and get yous sad sad life
  your answer is meaningless
  social media and travel pictures
  statistics which is how we inquire into reality again see      women are soulless retards who survive off of handouts in a vegetative stupor  somebodys got mommy issues  worship the state and attend religious services  thats an underage comment if i ever seen one      first two isnt me
  what do you do sounds pretty cool
    the guy is taking you on a ruise cruise with canned reddit rhetoric old man dont fall for it hes getting a laff
  tesla too women chased him like crazy and he dismissed them like cold mcdonalds french fries
  women are more likely to call law enforcement request harsh sentencing file for divorce seek health care from state funded hospitals and clinics take student loans ask for funding for public education seek punitive or reformative measures and social policy fixing through electoral politics support compulsory attendance support gun control support state intervention on behalf of minority communities approve affirmative action take welfare and ask for income assistance for child rearing than males attend religious services hold religious social and cultural views and be protective of their ingroup being inundated with culturally disparate outsides are literally more conservative when they are conservative than males  yyoure a babby   leave
  youll see how good your dad will take it once your mom dies assuming you dont commit suicide for being oh so lonely before
  i was unironically curious about what your reasoning was why do you believe this
  we were talking about women being capable of tolerating loneliness better than men doofus
    its a lot harder for women to be lonely than men tbf
  no not really men have a lower life expectancy and are more likely to die young most women will end up alone at some point in their lives
  posts on a science and math board  wholeheartedly believes whatever just so stories confirm his mistrust of women    yeah dude i honestly dont think you have a handle on logic or evidence like you seem to believe you do    i was being harsh yesterday not to white knight but because the evpsych arguments are awful and could literally only be believed by a retard or someone who wants them to be true so badly theyre willing to completely neglect standards of evidence     or maybe someone who has never understood anything about science but likes to feel smarter than other people so actively seeks out sciencysounding arguments for their previously held opinions like you
  such incel bs i did two months back packing and many women actually travel and stick to their partner there are also solo women travelers and they range from the party/drinking slut to the cultural experience bookie the vast majority of them are single and therefore not tied to anyone if and when they mention some long distance bf its usually an excuse to avoid guys hitting on them     lastly this whole more masculine man is full on projected insecurity many of these women were oblivious to locals and only stuck to other travellers specially the party types who are there basically on the international version of a speing break      tldr women arent travelling to meet some mythical incelpower trip masculine men just to challenge themselves have memorable experiences etc
  this incels live in a different reality from the rest of us     i think hypergamy is what it looks like to be in the bottom 5 of men if every single woman in and slightly above your league avoided you like the plague you would probably think that theyre all gravitating to one strata of men rather than simply the fuck away from you
  jokes on you my parents split up a long time ago
  how many girls have you slept with how many guys has your fat wife slept with
  thanks for this i actually chuckled you guys are hilariously dumb
  hahaha no both demonstrably false from neuroscience theyre just susceptible to media some become xenophiles and want to get fucked without anyone at home knowing
  puts on glove  this guy is a master baiter
  they dont sleep with them to avoid paying money to zipline they do it because theyre away from home and having fun
  make an account on tinder make a chubby white girl account on tinder she will get 100x messages than you guaranteed
  they leave home to find a mate
  and you think this would prove your whole point right    brainlet
  oh yeah fucking some hairy old zip line operator is the wet dream of all women fucking incels
  yo wadup im zip line operator pimp mack daddy
  thats a blog ran by elderly women mainly for elderly women doing a survey among its readers thats probably all there is to it    no        nearly twothirds of travelers today are women reports the george washington university school of business women also comprise 54 percent of coveted affluent travelers with annual incomes of 250000 or more up from 42 percent in 2010 according to the travel and hospitality marketing firm mmgy global
  using biology to explain the behavior of human males and females is unscientific
  when women become sexually mature they leave the old tribe her family to become part of a new tribe as to ensure healthy genes for her offspring    this phenomenon now occurs as a rapid and neverending series of migrations because of globalism and the endless options now available to women    also due to the allencompassing presence of birth control shell never actually settle down and integrate into a new tribe as nature intended
  tldr be a whore without your social circle finding out
  roastie detected your emotions give you away
  theyre not traveling to western countries full of obese beta boys have you even been more than 50 miles from your parents home
  travelling  means going to random countries to fuck random guys    its probably innate in women because if they slept around locally they would be known as a whore
  narcissism acceptance solo travel women can gab on all day about their solo travel while men would sound pompous and conceited    naivete and threat assessment differences men realize how dangerous traveling alone can be women instinctively though often erroneously realize society will be at their beck and call if they get into trouble this happens to such an extreme we see women traveling solo through muslim countries and 3rd world countries expecting to experience the same level of safety     women have instinctive value to a society men must earn it frivolously wasting money on a solo trip does not raise a mans value male leaders are more valuable not loners if a man does like to travel it would be more beneficial to travel in a pack and thus gain social proof     in continuing with society valuing women more if a woman is put into a situation where she is at risk to the same extent as a man society naturally will be more concerned about the woman thus solo female travel will gain more attention from society which gives women a greater incentive     basically men travel solo because its interesting and women do it for the attention
  just to challenge themselves  ive never understood why people mostly women say that mobile traveling is something they do because they want to challenge themselves its a fucking vacation with extra walking/movement surrounded by layer upon layer of safety nets or in the rare case youre a dumfuck and doing it when you cant afford it and only have limited cash on you and no credit cards the later case might be challenging but likely isnt most people who do that are just going to make a few phone calls and get wired some cash if they run into trouble the end     they only say its challenging themselves to feed their ego get attention and to sound like an independent empowered like so deep person
move thread to /r9k/  i think its time mods
  they should just ban every user in this thread    i bet these are the kinds of losers who would make fun of my girlfriend and is open relationship
  women are literally only capable of existing in a relational model the only way to find themselves is through the penis of a strange man
  5485  how could you miss something so basic
  yes and you clearly havent imagine being such a gigantic basement dweller that you think everybody in the 3rd world is a real man that western women want to fuck
women want exotic cawk
  nearly twothirds of travelers today are women    how did you miss the very first sentence
  older people travel more  older men dont care about traveling unless theyre already with a woman
            this is honestly too much im dying lmao  pol 2018  women dont wanna fuck me because theyre too into zipline operators  shouldve gone to zipline school kiddo 
  nazis arent welcome here nor are fallacies this is a science board fuck off nazi
  anon you may have misinterpreted me also sci loves fallacies
to fuck
  66666 still isnt equal to 85
    someone explain this to me what is the point except for navy ships needing many antennas and not having enough space
  having an adjustable antennae that can be programmed for height is warrant enough for it to exist instead of manually adjusting it or buying several sizes you just pump more water in
  it costs a lot of electricity to constantly pump water that high having a couple of normal antennas  cheap as fuck
  if he wants this to work for frequencies that need longer antennas he needs a better nozzle that stream turns into droplets pretty quickly
submarines
might be a neat way to upload or access data from the middle of nowhere a pump would be easier to lug around then an antenna
  i would use it to show people how smart i was
  it costs a lot of electricity to constantly pump water that high  if only they had a nuclear reactor laying around
  could this work in reverse like turn the ocean into one big radio antenna by floating a shitload of these little guys around
  tunability you can tune it to whatever frequency you want the other cool thing you can do is turn it off when you arent transmitting so that no one can detect the antenna
  holy fuck you guise
  shut it down
what kind of mushroom is this can i get high with it
i doubt that itd get you high
no the one you want has a fat white stalk that makes blue veins when crushed also a gold top
  damn thanks
  when you break the stalk youll know right away
the good ones grow in cow shit
  its common to find gold caps in bark gardens when it gets really cold  they always grow in the same spots
  anyone in here who gave you any information is a larping reject you have failed to provide a location for where it was picked geographically a location locally such as in bark under a tree in open field and the average temperature for the last two weeks    without any of the above unless you are an encyclopedia of mycological facts theres no way you can tell even then theres still most likely a case to be made between two or rmore varieties it could be without taking a spore print
  anyone in here who gave you any information is a larping reject  i beg to differ
  i picked it from the ground here in my front lawn its been about 25c the last few days     you know what fuckin hell im just gonna try it out then
    nvm someone threw it out f
  anyone in here who gave you any information is a larping reject  no youre just an autistic pseud who feels the need to show off how many unimportant details about obscure cases nobody here is going to deal with or care about its not that complicated shrooms  psilocybe cubensis unless otherwise specified and thick white stalk blue bruising and brown top are perfectly fine traits to describe it by
  if you ask 4chan advice on what to ingest what youre really asking is to die
  is it in the trashcan in the house go dig it off and rinse it off lol
  idk but my roommate here dumps the mushrooms somewhere special and id feel weird for asking lol     ill just look for the legit stuff out in the boonies when my semester ends
  so this happened before your roommate searches your room for mushrooms and throw them away in a secret garbage interesting
  roommates is what he calls his parents
  no they just sprouted outside the house she was in charge of cleaning the lawn today and i forgot to save the mushroom      why would i call my parents roommates
  you can just grow them u know
  thats how you find out 2 wks later you have liver failure from a deathcap
  ill have to think up a good excuse for cultivating a shroom plot here should be manageable i think      thats if i actually ate the thing
  u grow them indoors tho
  fuck i dont want my uncle and aunt to trip
  
  and a shroom plot wouldnt do that
    these things happen though   dont be that guy
  aight ill just do it back home
  well that guy sure is something
  the deadly amanitas which include the death cap a phalloides are almost completely white and have a structure/form that looks nothing like the type or mushroom in op theyre relatively easy to spot/id
  yeah but where the hell do you live dummy we dont even know what continent or climate youre in
    also it is almost certainly inactive at best and maybe toxic though probably not deadly at worst
  those similar in shape and size to ops photo dont they grow in tall grass
im convinced anybody who posts here asking for a mushroom id is a troll    otherwise stupid enough to deserve to be poisoned    ask at shroomeryorg
  they will request the same things people here have asked for location spore color etc in order to identify with any certainty
  humongous fungus
how reasonably is to try to self identify psylocybin mushrooms mushrooms can just outright kill ya
hold up so what kind of mushroom do i have here then      im in the philippines      looks pretty tasty i might add
  yea but they have a template and people there wont troll you in an id request thread    admittedly many id requests on shroomeryorg are literally op tier
  yes its very easy if you go do a little research      you havent provided any of the necessary details for a proper id despite having been asked it this very thread    i call troll
  you havent provided any of the necessary details for a proper id despite having been asked it this very thread  what do you need sorry its 434 am here and im getting sleepy
  youre legitimately retarded
  without any of the above unless you are an encyclopedia of mycological facts theres no way you can tell    you forgot to add that experts with encyclopedias have fucked up trying to id mushrooms and some have died or gotten very sick
  psilocybin mushrooms are notoriously easy to id for one they bruise blue when psilocybin oxidises it breaks down into a blue pigment     rule number one if it dont bruise blue dont put it in your mouth and wash your hands    edibles can be difficult to distinguish even at times for the informed if you arent 100 sure you know exactly what it is dont put it in your mouth and wash your hands    seriously i have been utterly astounded by the stupidity of people    took a friend out hunting shrooms showed him two different species educated him on all identifying features and habitat requirements    told him they must bruise blue at least ten times    fucking idiot goes out by himself and stuffs random shrooms in his mouth which didnt bruise blue took no photos did not seek an id from a third party    poisons himself    he lived but he shouldnt have    where do you find people who arent mentally handicapped
  hmm okay    habitat unturned soil   they just sprout out my front lawn safely away from grass  gills brownish white see op  stem white af thin lines  cap light brownish white tinge with little dots marking its surface  spore print color n/a was disposed of before i could check  bruising none observed  location quezon city philippines
  as others have said not active at best poisonous at worst
  youre an idiot yes blue bruising is usually psilocybin but when some of the very close lookalikes will murder you you really shouldnt risk it
  i was passing some cow shit the other day with mushrooms growing on top
will importing spores put you on some watchlist
  can you name a specific poisonous mushroom that has a thick white stalk blue bruising and a brown top
  name a psychedelic mushroom with a brown top you fucking clownfish    go eat your own shit

the techies may answer that even if almost all biological species are eliminated eventually many species survive for thousands or millions of years so maybe techies too can survive for thousands or millions of years but when large rapid changes occur in the environment of biological species both the rate of appearance of new species and the rate of extinction of existing species are greatly increased127 technological progress constantly accelerates and techies like ray kurzweil insist that it will soon become virtually explosive consequently changes come more and more rapidly everything happens faster and faster competition among selfprop systems becomes more and more intense and as the process gathers speed the losers in the struggle for survival will be eliminated ever more quickly so on the basis of the techies own beliefs about the exponential acceleration of technological development its safe to say that the lifeexpectancies of humanderived entities such as manmachine hybrids and human minds uploaded into machines will actually be quite short the sevenhundredyear or thousandyear lifespan to which some techies aspire is nothing but a pipedream

  agi  2029 in 10 years  singularity  2045 in 26 years    that was the prediction of googles most brilliant minds of ai take note that this prediction was based on the law of accelerating returns and not just some mere and probably biased opinion that means the prediction is realistic enough not optimistic nor pessimistic    i want to stress that again the prediction was realistic and natural not optimistic nor pessimistic    the realistic  natural scenario from the law of accelerating returns is that technology ex programming libraries  tools research papers etc increases like always and as we pile up these resources more hints about agi will emerge that means more people can do agi the knowledge will not be exclusive only for the big players  tip the best thing you can do now is to know programming im not talking about brainlet coding and be vigilant about the new resources/discoveries of the fields of science not just ai    the other scenario would be the paradigm shifter scenario where someone or some company discovers a new paradigm/mathematics to crack the problem of ai that is what we dont want to happen because the moment someone solve the problem alone he/she/it will literally become the ruler of this world

  why would they afford such things to the cattle when they have all the infrastructure and tools to keep them in a relatively steady state perpetual servitude theyre not going to be living next door and the separation will be vast expanses of wilderness probably with some trains    youre talking about old world mechanics those arent sticking around
  the realistic  natural scenario from the law of accelerating returns is that technology ex programming libraries  tools research papers etc increases like always  thats not what the law of accelerating returns is
  why would they afford such things to the cattle when they have all the infrastructure and tools to keep them in a relatively steady state perpetual servitude  because there is no united front of farmers you dingus and even if some organization somehow gained total control over a very diverse and chaotic researchs one clever farmer would see his chance of selling some stuff to the cattle so that he might make a buck personally i would prefer if social instituions make it possible that everyone can profit from future tech developments but we got some brainlet naturals     a few questions though what infrastructure do you meanwhat tools and how will they keep the tools away from them and why should they want that automatizazion doesnt require servitude and who are they can you identify them some names how do they organize themselves  what are old world mechanics what are new world mechanics

  and  look if a guy sends bombs at computer store owners because a road was built in front of him then isnt smart i guess the mkultra experiments did damage his brain a lot
  look if a guy sends bombs at computer store owners because a road was built in front of him then isnt smart  why    as for our constitutional rights consider for example that of freedom of the press we certainly dont mean to knock that right it is very important tool for limiting concentration of political power and for keeping those who do have political power in line by publicly exposing any misbehavior on their part but freedom of the press is of very little use to the average citizen as an individual the mass media are mostly under the control of large organizations that are integrated into the system anyone who has a little money can have something printed or can distribute it on the internet or in some such way but what he has to say will be swamped by the vast volume of material put out by the media hence it will have no practical effect to make an impression on society with words is therefore almost impossible for most individuals and small groups take us fc for example if we had never done anything violent and had submitted the present writings to a publisher they probably would not have been accepted if they had been been accepted and published they probably would not have attracted many readers because its more fun to watch the entertainment put out by the media than to read a sober essay even if these writings had had many readers most of these readers would soon have forgotten what they had read as their minds were flooded by the mass of material to which the media expose them in order to get our message before the public with some chance of making a lasting impression weve had to kill people
  would you define sending bombs to innocents as smart its the retareded rage of an incel who wasnt able to stay with a girlfriend he just was a murderer among other who raged against a world they didnt understand  by his own words  my motivation is personal revenge i dont pretend any kind of philosophical or moralistic justification  if you really want to get arguemtns for your hypocritical suicide then i would advise you to get thoreau that guy atleast never hurt anyone and i know that your only interest for ted stems of the fact that he was a edgy murderer

can someone help me understand how to do this probability problem for my math stats course     lets say that i have a datafile including every baseball team in the mlb including their team stats the question asking me what process i would take to compute the probability that the red sox would be included in a sample size of 2 the probability of selecting each team is proportional to the total number of home runs scored
    because entropy would decrease if heat transfer was reverseable thats why its a law of thermodynamic because it doesnt have to explain shit it just works like that
  the probability of selecting each team is proportional to the number of home runs  imagine i have a list of home runs and i pick one randomly its either by the red sox or not and calculating the chance of either is trivial if it isnt i remove all home runs that team has made and pick a new random homerun  sum the possibilities

say you jump as high as you can on earth and you end up travelling at 30 ft/s at your maximum speed if you tried that same jump on the moon would your maximum speed still be 30 ft/s
  just answer two questions  1 at what points in time of a jump from and to the same height is the speed maximal  2 how if at all does the force provided by your legs change with gravity
  1 when you land and immediately after you leave the ground   2 it doesnt
  so if you exert the same force against the ground but with less gravity accelerating you downwards the force of gravity begin less you know the answer to your original question

    this question has a lot of history behind it my favorite documentary on the topic      highly recommended
   how dangerous is nitrogen like if i accidentally flood a room with it and pass out and someone is nearby do i stand a good chance of being revived  no because the nearby person will probably pass out as well in cases where people die from suffocation or poisoning in an enclosed space the majority of fatalities 60 iirc are of people who enter the enclosed space to rescue the first person who didnt come out    a russian girl maria chelysheva if you want to google it lost her father mother brother and grandmother to a cellar containing solanine a poisonous gas given off by rotten potatoes the father went down to get potatoes the others went down looking for the ones who didnt return    nitrogen isnt toxic air is 80 nitrogen but it will displace oxygen and cause suffocation with suffocation involving a buildup of co2 eg placing a polythene bag over your head your body detects the excess co2 levels and induces panic interestingly this is about the only thing that can induce panic in people with a defective amygdala which controls the fightorflight mechanism this doesnt happen with nitrogen you just pass out and suffocate
  thanks fren
hey guys im pretty sure i know the answer to this but i would just like to see others opinions its a sampling question for statistics     question if we are trying to estimate the number of counties in the us would it make more sense to use a sample of population count or of land area     i would assume that land area would make much more sense for this correct the method would take 10 states randomly with probability proportional to land area     this would be more accurate than a similar sample of population right mainly due to the large landmass that the us is and how people tend to cluster in a couple large counties
  id recommend googling the number because sampling for available data is stupid  but area is definitely better pick a couple random states check the number of counties by square mile average and estimate based on the whole of the uss area
  i wouldnt be doing a simple random sample the states would be randomly selected with probability proportional to the land area of each state does this change anything
  nah
  great thanks anon
i cant wrap my head around this i want to figure out an equation that works like a parabola    if x  1 y  1  if x  5 y  5  if x  10 y  1    x  some magic  y for above    something like this would be a boon for my video game programming because as it stands i make something like above work by adding conditions if x  5 y ramp up and if x  5 y ramps down i want to figure out some beautiful oneline solution to this
  what exactly do you want the graph of your interpolation to look like draw it  of course you can fit a parabola through 3 points but this is probably not what you want because this will in general lead to oscillations when using more points look up runge phenomenon    you could fit a piecewise spline which would give you the most flexibility
  option one polynomial interpolations  option two modular functions these have some boundaries but for any n points you have you can make one pass through each
  modular functions  my bad im retarded  things like yx5555

  so i came across stirling engines the other day and was wondering     would a stirling engine that ran off temperature differences between underground say 7 feet and outside air be efficient i wanted to build a small motor to charge my phone
suppose there is a river and i build a dam on it less water will flow through the turbines than the predammed river that means a reservoir will form but wouldnt that reservoir just keep building up until it overflowed everything i know they add spillways but is the combined water flow of the turbine chute and the spillways equal to the flow if in the predammed river    also why dont they build dams where the entire volume of water is directed towards the turbines
  the efficiency of heat engine depends only on the difference in temperature the distance doesnt matter the problem with your idea is the temperature difference underground wont be maintained as heat is dumped into it

which one of these do you think looks the coolest  
best intro book into game theory and graph theory they must be manageable books for a mathlet
    lets assume the flow remains constant will the reservoir keep growing
  dude just thing about the conservation of mass for something like water 1 unit of volume is a fixed quantity of mass that means there is conservation of volume for the reservoir meaning every bit of volume gained has to have flowed in from the river and every bit of volume lost has to have exited by the dam volume cannot be created or destroyed only moved    i dont know how i could make this any more intuitive

so im diagonalizing a matrix and i finished but my matrix has the 11 and 33 entries flipped of what the example has and i can see that they used a different eigenvector order my question is does the order matter is my diagonal matrix also a valid matrix or is there something that im missing
  if you your problem tells you that you are working with an ordered basis specifically then the order matters but otherwise its fine the permutations of the eigenvectors in the basis determines what diagonal matrix you get so there are as many different diagonal matrices that are similar to the one you start with as there are permutations of eigenvectors
i think im misunderstanding pic related  why is there no case where neither x nor y are in math vg_i /math also what is the part with take the last edge on a path from x to math vg_i /math about since weve already assumed the edges existence in the case right

  the expression you posted turns into 491/7x not to the power of 2  you are correct that 1/72  1/49 but this is in the denominator of the fraction so 1/1/49  49
  my bad i meant to the xth power not squared there and i think i just realized what i was forgetting im an idiot 1/7x/1/49 is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal whoops

i have a table of every team in the mlb matched with the total number of homeruns that the team has hit there are 30 teams in mlb using this table im supposed to calculate the probability that the red sox and dodgers are selected for a random sample of size 2 this sounds basic but i dont want to get it wrong it should be 1/30  1/29 right
  product not sum also you forgot the reverse pairing so the probability is 2/30/29    maybe a simpler view 30 choose 2  1529 possible pairings unordered one of them is the one you want
  so the calculation would be 1/21/301/29
  no  1/30 times 1/29 is the probability that the random pairing is redsoxdodgers dodgersredsox is chosen with the same probability

anyone have that screencap about the history of wave physics and how the math behind it was discovered earlier and was purely theoreticak but nobody found a use for it until discovering waves
why dont we know why a proton weighs more than an electron cant we just look at whats inside and keep going deeper
  without going further we know that a proton weighs more than an electron from experiments done on both particles it takes more energy to accelerate a proton than an electron and thats that why something happens in physics is only relevant to the fundamental aspects you are going to assume as true because the experiment says so thas an empirical limit that you have to accept in any scientific field for all we know the electron is a fundamental particle so its physical properties define that particle and while you can ponder that certain physical properties come from other sources you still are going to reach a fundamental aspect that you have to take as a sort of axiom then its all philosophy and while there is interesting discussion within it it makes no sense to argue the point through empirical means

  im sorry missed typing the negative sign on the right so it is of course math ty  t1  lnt)))  c /math  finally math y  1  lnt  fracct /math
  thank you i understand the entire process but  tyyty  whats the reason for this i mean how do you get that result
  tyy is not ty ty  y  ty  to see that differentiate ft  ty using the product rule
  yeah i meant ty thanks again
  i didnt answer your question the general process is called using an integrating factor for odes of the form y  fty  gt if you can find a factor ut so that uy fuy  uy you can multiply the equation with ut and simply integrate both sides finding u is accomplished by solving u  fu
  because you cant go back in time
so i clean my dry herb vape pen with isopropyl alcohol and changed the coil to a brand new one and then it knocked me flat on my ass after just one hit usually its two or three hits just to a get a moderate high can someone help me understand this
how does on do rotations on avl trees
any smart people want to help me with this its been haunting my dreams for over a week now
have a problem with understanding finding vector x in the following case      math a   left beginarraycc   2  4   1  2   endarray  right left beginarrayc   x_1   x_2   endarray  right/math  mathv63/math    after applying gaussian elimination to the system of equations i get the following equation  mathx_132x_2/math  and the answer according to the book is  mathx3  0tx_22  1t/math  cba to make vertical vectors in tex again so just using transposed vectors    and of course my equation got the 3 and 2 in it but i have no clue how to form those vectors otherwise like where does the 0 and 1 come from that equation
  a fuck should have used more  to indicate space  just read 6 3 3 0 and 2 1
    a matrix is also singular so cant find inverse matrix
  whats n is it the set s that contains every natural smaller than or equal to n  if thats it id think about in term of nonrepeating aditions so that for 1 you can add nothing for all k or you can add 1 in one k so we have 2k
  yeah n  123n    the way im thinking about it so far is this the creation of sets at each list choice  first item in list any subset from n which is 2n  second item onward can add from the remaining elements     so like if n  4 and we want k  2  item 1 123  item 2 since 12 and 3 are already in the previous list we can add nothing or 4  item 3 if item 2 added nothing we have nothing or 4 again if 4 was added in item 2 we can only add nothing
  hm thats right but we can formalize it better  if for n there are so many ways of dividing the set into say l parts as l goes from 1 to n1  associated to each partition of the set in l is a permutation as you add piece by piece of the set and also empty sets  you should be able to solve the individual parts and adding it all up is easy
  respond to this
  from mathx_12x_23/math you know that all points on that line satisfy the equation the point mathpmatrix3  0/math is just one choice mathpmatrix1  1/math is another  the solution in your book is just a parametrization of this line
i am having issues with the integration to prove its normalized where int_aa psy dx 0 an the psy2dx malarcky anyone able to help me
how does this guy go from 5 to 6    
what would be an ideal textbook to self study for special and general relativity
  you should get a gaussian integral for the normalization what exactly do you need help with      its just applying the product rule for derivatives in reverse
  can someone please provide link to that mensa iq test people always post screenshots of here  cant find it
    nice website
can write semifunctional things in c  crush multivariable calculus courses  im obviously not dumb so why cant i understand linear algebra this is the most unintuitive bullshit ever god damn fuck matrices
  matrices are good for when you want to examine more than one of something often times one observes the most important features of a facet with scalars
  yes abelian is just named after a guy called abel who i imagine studied some commutative shit
  yeah im much the same i also hate geometry but this shit just seems so convoluted since youre smart you might just be able to study through it if you really double down and have it start to make more sense with more examples i read up a little more and kept rereading and it slowly started seeming less alien
  theres less gunk blocking the screen so more stuff can get through
    linear algebra is very intuitive once you start thinking about matrices as linear transformations watch 3blue1browns essence of linear algebra series for the right intuition
is there a good scientific python book for python 3  the wikis recommended books are for python 2
struggling to solve simple circuits  cant even begin to understand ac circuits  exam is a month from now  give me strength /sqt/
is it a rule that you never want to write a fraction with complex denominators and should always multiply the fraction with the complementary complex number
  yes because division in complex numbers is weird
  alright that makes the answer more sense
  you ideally want to write complex numbers in a form where the real and imaginary parts are both explicit ie abi where a and b are real but if a and b are both fractions with a common denominator then abi/c is basically just a compact representation of a/cb/ci
  show an example problem and well try to see why you struggle you probably need to work on some intuition its possible to fix in your timeframe try not to spend time worrying
i have the following problem  i am trying to solve a differentialequation system with eigenvalues  mathx_1x_12x_2/math  mathx_2x_13x_2/math  mathx_100 x_201/math  then the eigenvalues will be 2i and eigenvectors 1i 1  the problem is i dont see how i can get the answer here according to the book  mathx_1  2e2tsint/math  math x_2  e2t sintcost  /math  i know that the template of a complex solution to a differential equation has cos and sin in but i am still confused how i am supposed to multiply the eigenvectors into this
say   math e2tacostbsint cdot 1i 1 /math  math e2tacostbsint cdot 1i 1 /math  this will give the followingignoring a and b  math costicostisintsint/math  math cost  sint /math    and    math costicostisintsint/math  math costsint /math    adding these together gives the following  math acost /math  math acostbsint /math  i must surely be doing something wrong right
  ac singlephase circuits are exactly the same as dc circuits but you work with phasors instead of normal numbers  theyre actually easier as if you have any energy storing components such as capacitors or inductors they can be modeled as a complex impedance instead of as a function of time that needs to be transformed to its frequency domain equivalent  note that regardless of what youre dealing with you will always use the same tools namely thevenins theorem and kirchhoffs laws  i highly suggest you get yourself a copy of matthew sadikus fundamentals of electrical circuits its probably the best introductory book on the subject and most likely is the one being used by your teacher its also very good for self learning as it does convey everything as simply as possible  as a last note id really wouldnt stress about it circuits aint the hardest thing out there and there are tons and tons of resources out there on the subject you also have more than enough time to take a significant grasp on the subject  dont stress it bro just get to it

  literally nothing only performance iq matters
    i dont know how to integrate it
    is it possible you didnt look at the initial condition the general solution is   mathxt  c_1 e2itpmatrix1i  1  c_2 e2itpmatrix1i1/math  so mathx0  pmatrix c_1c_2  i c_1c_2  c_1  c_2   pmatrix0  1/math    youll get mathc_1  1/2  i/math if you now multiply the stuff out and write all complex numbers in polar form youll probably encounter the phase shift that sends your trigonometric functions pi/2 to the side thats why sin and cos are the other way around from what you thought
ok lets say that there is a social study that shows a correlation between two variables  which studies are required to know if the relation is causation or not
  well id suggest looking up a gaussian integral then they show up all the time and its definitely worth knowing its a wellknown fact that the indefinite integral is not expressible in terms of elementary functions on the other hand the total integral is pretty straightforward to calculate square the whole integral rewrite that as a double integral and then go to spherical coordinates
  polar coordinates
are there any simple way to find solution for a cubic equation0 i was never taught that in class other than very anecdotal cases where i should look at the last number eg if the last number is 2 then it must be x2x1x1
  theres a formula but it isnt simple
  o fuk so if i am at exam and is required to find the eigenvalues of a 3x3 matrix i am pretty screwed right there was one task that was basically impossible with my knowledge to solve to find the solution for x for a cubic equation and i had to use an online calculator
  say this one   math x34x25x2 /math  here the only way i managed to solve it was to assume that the last part could only have 1 solution  all x must be positive as xxxx  the terms could be no higher than 2  as one term has 2 in it the others must be 1  thus i figures out it could be x2x1x1 which was correct but lets say the last number is 12 then wtf could it be x3x22 or could there be other answers
  or what if the last number is positive then its pure guess which x solution could be negative
        depends on what kinds of expressions they are and what you mean by simple there are explicit solution formulas for the roots of a cubic google cardano  if youre sitting in front of a piece of paper it is often simplest to guess a root and factor it out for this the best way is horners method    for example lets try finding the roots of math3x37x25x1/math all integer roots divide the constant term 1 in this case but 1 is not a root 1 is you can also check for this by comparing the sum of coefficients of even powers with the sum of coefficients for odd powers if they are the same 1 is a root   so you split off that root to get x13x24x1    these are the steps you should keep in mind for those kinds of exam questions    sum of coefficients is zero  1 is a root    sum of even coefficients  sum of odd coefficients  1 is a root    in a polynomial with constant term all integer roots divide this constant   but lets say the last number is 12  then you check 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 6 6
  but lets say the last number is 12 then wtf could it be x3x22 or could there be other answers  it could be x  ax  bx  c for any abc such that abc  12 eg a12 b  c  1 or a12 b c  1 or a  b  31/2 c  4 etc so infinitely many solutions you should do it like  said and just check small integers then after finding the first root use polynomial division and the pqformula you know about polynomial division right
  pq formula i e only heard continental euros use that term
why is pluto so cold when its getting the same amount of energy from the sun as the earth how the fuck does a goldilocks zone even exist
  its getting the same amount of energy from the sun as the earth  ask me how i know that youre retarded

if inbred organisms are more likely to mutate does this make their population prone to faster evolution
  the arrows point to where the set goes from the point in your example it goes up from 5 so its points positively while it goes down from 0 and so points negatively    but really im just disgusted by this rape of interval notation which is some of the best and most intuitive notation in math
  genetic mutations/conditions are more likely to travel and spread through smaller more genetically isolated populations  its the isolation thats the main factor there the inbreeding is a seperate thing it just doubles down on those conditions and mutations cements them into the population

whats the comfiest distribution /sci/    i vote exponential
  obviously gaussian    thats why its called the normal distribution
the normie distribution
  uniform duh
  integrable distribution  gives you an integrable polarization mathp/math  lets you impose holonomic constraints and perform symplectically reduction  trajectories lie in the leaves of its foliation  dynamical operators on mathp/mathwavefunctions automatically satisfy heisenberg equations of motion
 he still uses distributiond anot a measure theoretical approach to deal with probability
  variance is ba2/12
  delta function
  he does nothing useful with probability
the normal gaussian distribution is the comfiest one
  poisson obviously

  just remember that quantum mechanics implies you are entangled with the universe in a way that is instantaneous and not bound by the speed of light
  so you probably misunderstand qm as most of the people do   phase velocity can be superluminal and effectively group velocity can too a shadow can exceed the speed of light
    implying that having a positive influence on the geometry of existence is somehow meaningless
if free will exists you can chose to always be positive and happy 
  if free will exists you can chose to never be hungry 
  fbpb
free will is a spectrum some are born with more of it than others and some are born with none at all    some speak of white privilege or male privilege etc but free will privilege is the greatest privilege of all
  what do you guys think about determinism  as far as im aware all things are bound by cause and effect therefore free will is non existent
if free will exists you can hold your breath until you die
  events are bound by cause and effect but free will still exists as you can act according to your reason   of course free will is coloured by experience but that doesnt make it less free if youre aware of it
    and yet op constantly choses to fellate penises    guess that must make him very happy by his own definition
  you can hold your breath until you faint but then you become unconscious and thus cannot exert conscious control to stop breathing and your automatic breathing will kick in   it is trivial to reason out how one would use this to cause themselves to asphyxiate please call the suicide help hotline if you decide its still a good idea after that point knowing then that your free will does exist since the possibility would be real then
  your thoughts and decisions are all results of chemical and electrical processes in your brain so how can we have any real influence over them  could it be possible that everything you do was set at the moment of the big bang
never though of it like that now im really happy thanks op 
free will doesnt exist we have the power of being a first mover but we cant control the outcome and we have only partial control of the process its not what you know that gets you in trouble its what you dont know
  well emotion sounds like signal you percieve not decision you make
  first bost pest bost
  good idea man when i was dying of thirst i tried this and achieved the rainbow body and realized that this is all a simulation  
   we have the power of being a first mover  no we dont
  no because the enviroment effects us    larp harder cunt
  your thoughts and decisions are all results of chemical and electrical processes in your brain so how can we have any real influence over them  we cannot we are the product of those processes part of them if you will  could it be possible that everything you do was set at the moment of the big bang  there are truly random events and the reply depends on what do we think about them if we think that they are oneindeterminedoutcome then no if we think of them as theworldbranchingintoeverypossibleoutcome then yes
  is there any good reason to believe free will exists
  if free will exists you can choose to always have a boner
  yes suffering is the easy and popular choice
we are all npcs with just a miniscule sliver of free will you are programmed thats an absolute truth    but you can be programmed by the external world or by yourself
  free will doesnt exist though
  we have influence over choice  there are truly random events and the reply depends on what do we think about them  if we think of them as theworldbranchingintoeverypossibleoutcome then yes  this still would not prove we had free will because you dont define how we would end up at a certain branch among the infinite branches youre just saying its not predetermined if its not predetermined there still remains two possibilities    1 we get to that branch via randomness which means were at the mercy of randomness and thus dont have free will  2 we get to that branch via our own free will which is circular reasoning at worst    its really a paradox you cant have free will if its influenced by chaos true randomness but if theres no chaos involved in free will then were left with determinism which automatically defeats free will as our decisions would be predetermined since the beginning of time well before we were even born     ie we choose cheerios or corn flakes every morning but a certain truly random percent of the time we flip the truly random coin to determine which choice we make i would not say we have free will in that case because our choices are at the mercy of randomness and whats worse is we wouldnt even know which choices were random and which were via free will which is still basically undefined
  yes we can but we might not have enough strength to always choose that route which is why believing and trusting in an infinite and allloving god is so important and useful in staving off depression and despair
  do you will yourself to be hungry
  yes by choosing to eat 
  i dont know why you even entertain the idea of randomness being a thing of exists   that coin would be just part of a system of particles all completely bound of cause and effect nothing can ever be random
free will actually exists but only for extremely self aware people self concious and even then has about 1 effect on the actual outcome of your life 99 is predetermined by genetics chemicals environment social etc etc basically in this definition its just that instead of being programmed constantly by the outside world your internal feedback loop ie conciousness is so much stronger in self concious people that it has almost as much weight as external processes youre reprogramming yourself constantly of course that reprogramming is also predetermined but hey at least its a pretty damn good illusion
  the more meta you get and the better you become at becoming self aware and observing your own behavior the more free will you have     say everytime you wake up to a rainy day and you tell yourself wow what a disgusting weather every single time at some point your self concious process will kick in and youll realize that this causal pattern rainy day makes you say disgusting weather instinctively is hardwired allowing you to change it however you need to be extremely self aware in the first place to be able to pull this off
  this still would not prove we had free will  yes i know you are kinda barking up the wrong tree here i deny the reality of free will i just commented on whether your actions are or are not determined in advance in neither case are they determined by some sort of will  its either deterministic or random
  i dont know why you even entertain the idea of randomness being a thing of exists  thats because you havent caught up with even the 1960s level of physics check bells inequality and the proven inexistence of hidden variables
news alert we dont have free will
    you guys have any scientific explanation for this  im not saying youre wrong but as far as known science goes there is no justification for this
happiness sadness depression pleasure theyre all choices some people are just too brainlet to do it
  that sounds like you still have just one layer of perceived emotion    going happy when you should have worries can fucking kill you
  these are theories and like you showed theyre outdated
pure determinism doesnt affect free will its you that decided as bunch of effect of physical laws
  but they arent there are no hidden variables ergo at least some processes are truly random virtual particle creation beta decay of individual nuclei     or in a different framework they appear to be truly random because they cannot coexist with their alternatives and so we always only enter into interaction with one of the alternatives
  photoreceptor cells in the eye get excited by electromagnetic radiation  signals get passed to the visual cortex  various neural pathways activate  motor cortex fires up  im a speshul snowflake muh free wheel xd
i realize the arguments against free will here are pretty good but i still dont like the feeling that people would use this to completely remove any and all responsibility and blame from themselves however you think the world works however you define free will the fact remains that decisions are a thing and they determine what your life is like    as long as you can agree to that fact i dont really care
  t small will
  free will is all about perception and relativity    we cannot know the future or all of the things that determined our decisions because of this free will exists because the product of the mechanics of will is unkowable until it comes to fruition
  i realize the arguments against free will here are pretty good  more like unbreakable the whole concept of libertarian free will is absurd because the brain doesnt have a hypothetical mechanism to exert free will and is fundamentally governed by the same laws as everything else  i still dont like the feeling that people would use this to completely remove any and all responsibility and blame from themselves  both responsibility and blame are outright nonsensical since they are scientifically undefined abstractions  the fact remains that decisions are a thing and they determine what your life is like  no they arent do you have anything to back that up      the problem is more about the exertion of control there isnt a mechanism to exert your will since your will doesnt exist you as a sack of water and carbon have as much influence over the world as a brick
  libertarian free will is absurd  total nonsequitur in the context of libertarianism freedom means not being limited in the choices you make by other people or the government it says nothing of brains or determinism or whathaveyou    both responsibility and blame are outright nonsensical since they are scientifically undefined abstractions  a lot of things are either undefined or are hard to define by science that does not mean they dont exist or are nonsensical    no they arent do you have anything to back that up  of course i knew i would need sour cream tomorrow morning so i decided to enter a grocery store on my way home and purchased a container of it this changed my life in that i now possess some sour cream    just because this was all supposedly predetermined doesnt mean that i did not make the decision you can make decisions based on outside influence
  i have literal idea to commit decision to throw brick at you and see how much influence it will have on your body
  just because this was all supposedly predetermined doesnt mean that i did not make the decision  decision means you choose between alternatives if you have no choice figuring out what the only course of action is should not be called a decision   so in what sense do you have a choice in a deterministic universe you dont you are a guy in a movie you will experience making the choice when the movie gets to that part
  total nonsequitur in the context of libertarianism freedom means not being limited in the choices you make by other people or the government it says nothing of brains or determinism or whathaveyou  you basically informed me you have no idea about the subject its a philosophical concept    a lot of things are either undefined or are hard to define by science that does not mean they dont exist or are nonsensical  such as  responsibility and blame require free will to define and are thus void concepts if you want to validate your concepts you are the one who has to define them scientifically if you cant they are worthless    of course i knew i would need sour cream tomorrow morning so i decided to enter a grocery store on my way home and purchased a container of it this changed my life in that i now possess some sour cream  you abstract these to the extreme the thing that caused you to buy dat shit were neural pathways firing they fired due to external stimulus    just because this was all supposedly predetermined doesnt mean that i did not make the decision  provide arguments you nigger by what exact mechanism do you obtain magical powers that detach you and the particles youre made of from the mechanical univers and its laws
   and thats allowing for a deterministic universe im of the opinion that the universe has truly random sources of events which complicates things somewhat  mostly concerning the unavailability of adequate terminology to describe it
  i have literal idea to commit decision to throw brick at you and see how much influence it will have on your body  you sure convinced me of your magical entropy and determinismbending powers
  that wasnt even purpose i dont try to influence religious people
  its a philosophical concept  no its a political one    such as  morality emotion pain good bad etc    responsibility and blame require free will to define and are thus void concepts  for the purpose of this conversation let them be consequences of actions free will or not there are actions and there are consequences    if you cant they are worthless  they have worth to me they are in laws they make differences between life and death and property and freedom behind bar kind not brain kind    the thing that caused you to buy dat shit were neural pathways firing they fired due to external stimulus  not denying that also dont see how it means it wasnt a decision    provide arguments you nigger by what exact mechanism do you obtain magical powers that detach you and the particles youre made of from the mechanical univers and its laws    decide come or bring to a resolution in the mind as a result of consideration  i considered i came to a result was it possible i could have made another decision according to you definitely not but did i consider the thing yes i did i remember the train of thought did i come to a result yes i bought the sour cream
  no its a political one  you continue to double down on your retardation      morality emotion pain good bad etc  cringe all neurologically defined or undefined abstractions due to flawed premises are you genuinely retarded    also dont see how it means it wasnt a decision  you dont have the mechanism to make decisions    i considered i came to a result was it possible i could have made another decision according to you definitely not but did i consider the thing yes i did i remember the train of thought did i come to a result yes i bought the sour cream  all due to subatomic interactions outside of your power holy fuck
  you continue to double down on your retardation  completely separate from the political one both of us were right besides from my previous posts it was obvious that i was on your side on the philosophical issue so why bring it up no free will okay i began by saying you had a good case    cringe all neurologically defined or undefined abstractions due to flawed premises  you asked for undefined things i gave you some thanks for acknowledging i was right    you dont have the mechanism to make decisions  not an argument    all due to subatomic interactions outside of your power  this is in no way a counterargument to the quoted line weve been over this i accept the subatomic stuff  i proved i made a decision by definition and inside your framework
  yep that is what i am doing
  if you believe that free will implies randomness but is incompatible with it then you have an oxymoron the only meaningful solution here is to fix your education 
  choice happens therefore it exists in that sense
  yeah it really is that simple and i keep telling people this  happiness is absolutely subjective happiness is absolutely a choice  this is why you have depressed people who have perfectly normal lives and why you have people who are happy even though their lives are utterly shit  the only thing that can change whether or not you are happy is you
  that doesnt follow you worthless faggot
  liar
  we have no free will buy we have free will if were aware we dont  alright
  these are theories  the most frequently and accurately measured theories humanity has ever come up with
  virtual particle creation  calm down there bro
if free will doesnt exist why do i feel like i have it
  because you are unaware of the constraints that make it impossible
  compatibilism is handwaving akin to how catholics retreat behind mysteries of faith whenever a contradiction arises somehow we dont know how these things are compatible because wed feel bad if they werent    incidentally the catholic church teaches predestination too and the way free will and predestination can be reconciled is one of those mysteries of faith in this they are in full agreement with sunni muslims
    drivel
free will exists its just you dont have it anymore you sold the only thing that makes you better than rocks and dirt and became a wage cuck    want to use your free will to be happy become a bohemian bum bums and beggars can be some of the happiest people just ask buddha
im currently on a mission to make msg from kelp by boiling it and reducing the solution until solid ive ended up with this ugly brown shit that makes my tongue buzz so i think ive got it any advice for whitening/ turning into powder its kind of hard but still not completely dry its a little gummy im utter shit at chem so please dont use big ass words im aware that ajinomoto msg is available for 1rupee per metric ton but my roommate is a organifag and wont accept processed foods
ur bigass mum lmao
  sorry mums gone
  msg causes brain damage
  my roommate is a organifag  just lie to them organifags are retards of the highest order
  thanks for the help anon
  youre a retard of the highest order and im almost relieved youre being sterilized
  youre being sterilized  citation needed
  provided many times will be provided again    luckily youre probably not able to act on it anyway max ambivalence
  yeah when injected into the veins msg isnt good for you along with many other things
  when injected into the veins  this is why i inject msg directly into my balls
  msg isnt the sterilant it just screws up your hypothalamus enough that impulse control and social functioning is altered enough that youre easy to control
  this is some info wars level idiocy
  too bad its true
  how has everyone in asia not already turned into mindless retarded socially retracted zombies then
  they have
  ok go back to pol tinhead
  youll see
57 nigga here  wondering how science has allowed me to have a preference right now at least for women taller than me with bigger proportions   are humans just so far from other animals that things like this can happen now am i simply a freak deviant is this just me subconsciously trying to improve the gene pool
  you just want what you will never have pretty standard human trait
  fair enough  not gonna lose hope that the 6 foot mommy gf with huge hands and feet may come into my life someday though tbqh
  just lower your standards a bit
your brain is trying to fuck your shit up baka women dont like to be bigger than their men
bump
  actually 17 of women prefer their men to be smaller and shorter than them
  during college i dated women who were taller than me it was a hassle in many ways but i couldnt help being attracted to them then one way i was at a frat bonfire friend was in the frat i was a gdi and saw this amazonian tier girl in a bikini standing nearby after admiring her for a bit something clicked my attraction was due to an unresolved oedipus complex my attraction to women taller than me was due to issues with alienation from my mother at an early age your attraction might be due to something else but almost certainly is because of some unresolved issue in the back of your brain once i realized the source of my attraction to these women it mostly went away
i have known a few of these pairings in my time and they all worked out so go for it op
  why cant you just like being smaller than women without it being all oedipal
  you might i was just relating my personal experiences as one possibility generally men need to be able to dominate their women and women need to feel dominated by their man its possible but much more difficult for this dynamic to work when the man is smaller the core cause of why op is attracted to women larger than him will help him going forward if he is able to discover it
  holy shit anon   be me  hate my mom since kindergarten   always want a tall girlfriend   never put two things together     thanks anon i dont think i will overcome the addiction tho
  try not to cry mommy next time you engage in coitus with a tall woman
  ill do what i want  girls say daddy all the time during sex its time to reverse these patriarchal norms
  tfw love my mom but still have a major tall woman mommy kink  wtf is wrong with me
  wtf is wrong with me  nothing youre just ahead of the evolutionary curve
i have a friend who eats the same thing everyday pepperoni pizza he eats nothing else for the entire day and he reports to me that he never feels hungry my questions are    1 why does he never feel hungry throughout the day  2 can someone actually sustain this diet for years on end without medical issues
  can corroborate not feeling hungry for extended periods of time after eating pizza even after 20 hours of fasting im not particularly hungry i just eat because i dont want to go into a full blown 24 hour fast my own throwaway theory for the lack of hunger is that the highfat nature of the diet makes the body go into a fatburning mode which is more sustainable because of the higher amounts of fat store vs glycogen store glycogen stores are comparatively limited and their depletion causes a hunger response which is usually satisfied before the transition into fatburning mode which a pizza diet kickstarts this of course is all pseudoscientific conjecture and some biochem fag could probably btfo me right now so take it as you will    anyway as for the sustainability of the diet there is a serious lack of vitamin a and c in that diet so id imagine he would eventually develop scurvy and symptoms of vitamin a deficiency
tfw youve been off junk food for so long that looks revolting  feels good man
redpill me on the double slit interference pattern
imagine shining a light into two vaginas
  look at the picture
  basically proof of gods existence
  particles are waves as long as theyre not observed
  observed  what does this mean in layman terms
  it means measured but the observer doesnt have to be a human it can be anything
  measured how do you mean the light interacting with something do the miniscule amount of light absorbtion and scattering by air count too
  i know next to nothing about quantum mechanics but this seems like a really stupid way of thinking about particlewave duality if something has wavelike properties under certain conditions and particlelike properties under others then to me it seems like the problem is in the initial classification of things as either particlelike or wavelike
  i know next to nothing about quantum mechanics  yeah no shit
  as long as its a measurement which tries to determine which slit the photon went through it counts as a measurement      fundamentally the entity is described by a wave function but the wave function can be more wavelike or more particlelike
  then hes in the same boat as the rest of us
  basically proof you are the god
  no not really schrödingers cat is the example that it has to be human
  the fucking cat example was used to shit on the idea that humans observing something matters
  brainlet the post
  the probability function ie the wave properties of particles is analogous to fields in classical physics waves are no more physical than fields neither of which can be directly measured     the interference pattern has absolutely nothing to do with waves it has everything to do with the uncertainty principle at the slit    not making a measurement at the slit allows a particle to have a wider range of energy and momentum creating a wider pattern at the detector measuring at the slit bounds the energy and momentum so that it can only exist where it is observed on the detector ie no intereference    calling it an interference pattern is a misnomer from when it was poorly understood the uncertainty principle is the ultimate redpill
  measurement error
    what do you mean what else if not human could be the observer a machine a cat    does it mean that us marely observing the particle will somehow influence it    t brainlet
  observing means shooting photons at the particle for example of course that will influence it
  photon with momentum can go any direction after interacting with a fermion for example air dust or slit
  brainlet here  is the uncertainty principle certain  hard to believe physics isnt deterministic at all levels from my brainlet view  but then that would destroy free will
  implying that free will makes any sense whether the universe is purely random instead of purely deterministic
  explain the meme that its in two places at once but if you look at it its not
  your vision is quantum entangled with the photons
  the intactnesses that make it through each have their own omnidirectional turnovers out is only half of all directions
  hard to believe physics isnt deterministic at all levels from my brainlet view  then just think of it from this point of view  physics is not deterministic at any level
  when you quantize things like position momentum energies etc observation doesnt come for free depending on whether you subscribe to orthodox theory or not there are axioms or theorems in the other paradigms as to how you can treat quantum experiments measurement is a bad word to use in copenhagen since its strictly upholds that particles dont exist until ideal measurement    basically when you follow a particles position through time there isnt an interference pattern because you have specific information there is dual behavior but basically you have to examine the collapse of the wave function the interference pattern lets us talk about how particles collect in discrete intervals there are more sophisticated mathematical reasons but essence is that no matter what theory you believe looking does not come for free take more quantum theory courses until your teaches stop just teaching you to shut up and calculate all of my best quantum professors have been skeptics of copenhagen so im a little biased you have to understand the born rule bells argument quantum nonlocality superliminal propagation how hv theories like bohmian mechanics surpass the basic arguments like hardy and ghz and most importantly the measurement problem unfortunately its hard to have this conversation until youre comfortable shutting up and calculating
  bait
  if it makes you feel better you can choose to believe that it was predetermined whether or not the system would be measured
does the particle take on the wave function because    1 it is not probabilistic but we never measure it precisely so probabilistic is the best we got it can take on one value at any time    2 it is fundamentally probabilistic and takes on multiple values at any time    im sure its 2 but honestly that doesnt explain much
why does shooting photon at electrons count as observing what about the fact that the photos have to more or less collide with the slits or the rightside barrier
  actually the pilot wave explains it very well
    watch this you idiots
  bohmian mechanics is beautiful
can anyone explain the actual equations please i wanna know the real thing not analogies
  eigenvalues
    whoops i meant to say eigenvalues
  observing means shooting photons at the particle  explain this i was not away that my eyes shot a laser i thought that other things could emit their own photons towards my eyes for example and in such a case it would seem like you should be able to get accurate readings though obviously as this thread suggests that isnt the case
  even cooler is the quantum eraser experiment when the photon used to observe the reaction gets unread resulting in the double slit returning to a interference pattern brings into question what qualifies as an observer
  excellent vid so far thanks anon
  i was the first person to bring up quantum eraser im this discussion do you gets even quantum mechanic
  how can light behave like a wave if there is no ether waves require a medium in fact thats why they propogate again at each slit its because they push against the medium an the medium pushes against the walls of the slits  i wonder how the water portion of the double blind experiment would go in zero gravity would the water still behave as a wave
  your post is should be put as an image illustrating not even wrong
  define ether most people dont use it in the same way implied by tesla
  the medium that allows light to move in a wave for example sound waves arent a thing without a medium to travel through but you could also throw an individual particle of the medium that creates sound and thered be no wave
  you just made a circular argument   and its not how ether is used historically so your definition is basically headcannon fan fiction  you also are not considering that spacetime is a thing rather than a default given space is not a void its a medium in flux
  show me the circle as i dont see it  1 all waves consist of medium usually under the effect of being in a pressurized environment or an environment with significant gravity or both sound from my juvenile understanding travels through various mediums like the steel rail of a train track or the open air bouncing molecules and with this physics a wave is created because its in an invisible sea the reason you get new ripples at each slit is because the medium water is easiest to visualize is pushing against the walls of each slit and then pushing back against itself too as it passes through this is easier for me to believe than that it is magic the double blind experiment works with water too not just light and it would work with sound too except maybe the weird observer thing but youd have to test it to see
  yes there is a medium but you calling it ether doesnt make that the same usage for that term in the past you said that light moves in a wave due to ether and when asked to define ether you said it was the medium that light moves in thats the very obvious circle  while you still ignore the fact we already know that space is a medium
  can you prove that there that the space inside of a zero gravity vacuum is a medium google says theres a medium in space but its random dust and gasses so its not space itself as you suggest  how do i punch space and measure the effect
  yes you can with enough energy  here is a layman friendly video for you to get your beak wet  
    so far this one isnt enlightening me ill still watch but i think you misunderstand  a particle doesnt need a medium to travel through but for many particles to act as a wave say water molecules they have to be under the effect of physical laws that regulate their motion like pressure and gravity and inertia and more and thats why i was curious if water would still ripple at each blind in zero gravity vacuum or if it would just interfere like particles when i visualize it in my head i see it not behaving as a wave in that situation
  i am cursed with a good attention to detail are you aware that his supercomputer simulation is a 1 second clip on infinite loop
  you do realize there are timestamps in these comments and i know that you just skipped that part and made a assumption as if its news to me did you realize this video is for layman like you to get a starting point and then investigate more seriously sometimes i think people like you post for attention
  anon you realize i kept watching after i posted right  for the layman  sure is strange to claim to have a supercomputer simulation and its just a one second clip on loop to me it looks like low quality propaganda or some shit like that
  you should be compelled by this video that blatantly fakes a simulation hoping the viewer believes its real
            
  its fundamentally a wave like property so number two
    retards dont even n realize its a simulation of where quarks are likely to be in a vacuum the already known science is that the further you really to measure the more uncertain position becomes heisenberg uncertainty principle the video is meant as a starting point for attention seeking idiots that use ether wrong its the subject of avoidance as you make an false claim about the videos premise based on a short segment of it
  the video is deceptive and i explained why i cant find any of his claims credible withstanding
  you didnt explain anything you pointed to a single part of the video never represented as the full simulation and you claim because they loop some footage the whole video gets thrown out you are literally lying to protect your false claim and misuse of ether
  the story of the stork delivering babies is for kids but its also sure as fuck a lie and completely unlike how it really goes down
  the use of the word ether isnt important to me though so thats wrong too the video makes a point about how what we are viewing is a supercomputers simulation of the energy in a piece of empty space but its actually just a bullshitted one second clip for laymen anything that lies to you shouldnt be trusted
  why would i explain a video you posted which lied to me about a supercomputers simulation
  how to know an intellectually dishonest they avoid talking about substance and reach for allegories in order to attack people that undermine their flawed ideas  you failed to define ether without being circular you even failed to even use ether in the same way it has been historically by such figures as nikola tesla you falsely make a claim about the video but its not representation of its content and you are so off base with your science it cant even be used to predict the difference of interference patterns when theres an observation and in the quantum eraser experiment
  thats not true you told me to use an unreliable source as a starting point and never answered my questions you deflected to a video which deceives the viewer instead of posting substance because all you know is what those videos tell you because you never even knew that was just a one second clip on repeat and now youre damage controlling
  at no time did it lie you gave a false premise of a lie based on the fact that they loop some of forage so you can see the see the data points they are discussing you are basically lying about the video at this point
  you are lying about the video in the most hilarious way go to /x/
  how is that video unreliable
  it depends entirely on the effect obviously water particles that have no force exerted on them are going to be completely still
  he directly states that were viewing a supercomputers simulation and it sure is a clever looped clip but when you look close you can tell hes lying and its just a faked one second gif on loop watch the whole fucking vid that you posted yourself anon  im watching again to quote the lie  empty space is not truly empty i know because ive seen it this is a simulation by professor derek leinweber at the university of adelaide  one second gif goes on loop  it was made using a supercomputer to crunch the calculations of quantum chromodynamics  without sauce on the simulation the video is deceptive
  once they hit the slits forces will exert from that
    it states that its showing a supercomputer simulation to us but its actually only showing us a bullshit one second gif on loop this is called a lie
  youre right however in order to measure it we need to see it this means at the very least a single photon is absorbed and re emitted by the particle being observed so whatever it would have been doing before the photon hit it its now doing something after      its a stupid argument light is a quantization of the em field fields require no medium to exist i along with many physicists dont believe fields actually exist at all
  what if the distance between the observer and the photon is as close possible
  says the fucking guy that ether is the reason light travels in a wave but fails to define ether be either the historic term it the one made up in your head you also fail to plug that into the observed double slit that makes the interference patterns go away and the quantum eraser experiment that destroys the information of the observing photon that makes the interference pattern return  your claim the video is deceptive is a fucking lie
  the simulation length does not constitute a lie you fucking retard
  i already defined it as the thing or combination of forces that allow a wave formation since it is required for a wave to form waves are a result of external forces not intrinsic to a substance
  but isnt the uncertainty principle only true because they behave like waves
  bullshit yes it does it suggests that its fake and since no one can post the real simulation with citation that even so much as has that portion of that fake animation in it it should be assumed as such
  thats not a definition
  you must have 85 iq
  i dont think you would accept any definition but one that affirms your pre existing belief even in the face of deception you are unwilling to accept a challenge against them clearly
  id accept a definition thats actually useable not some philosophical nonsense that uses the term name that tesla used but not even remotely in the same way
  it doesnt matter for a given slit length you can calculate the position and momentum that allows it to go through the slit as soon as you measure the position ie which slit it goes through you are restricting the momentum that can be observed by those particles to ones that in aggregate will not give an interference pattern this is because of the uncertainty principle     the math is actually very basic say you have a 5 mev stream of electrons being shot out of your collimator say a slit is 4mm wide and the screen is 1m away now you can calculate all of the momentum with direction allowed that will hit the screen    then restrict the width from 4mm to 50 micrometers see which momenta are allowed then
  the double blind experiment works with water too not just light and it would work with sound too  with sound too  sound is made of particles  no
  they wont hit slits if they arent moving in the first places
  being critical of accepted laymen belief is a sign of low intelligence  noticing a sleight of hand trick in a video is a sign of low intelligence  whatever you need to justify that bias
  move the slits into them
  well molecules youre right in the pedantic sense that they arent quantum particles
  projecting a sleight of hand in video over looping data of a simulation while presenter discussed information in 10 seconds of a 5 min video  yeah i think thats a sign of low intelligence alright  claiming someone had a bias towards a philosophical claim reusing a term incorrectly for a new concept  yup low iq confirmed
  anon im clearly talking about your bias to trust a video that lies to you and the obvious truth that you never knew it was a one second loop until i told you
  show me where the video informs you you are watching a one second loop instead of letting you believe youre watching a ten second supercomputer simulation
  christine fords two front doors
  they would move in a wave like pattern this is the case with every molecule unless quantum coherence is broken
  sound is made of molecules  molecules of h20 behave as waves and particles  shooting an entire h20 molecule through a double slit  light is a molecule
  i think therefore you are
  make the slit proportionately larger
  i didnt claim light was a molecule its obvious that liquids can behave as waves too though they are made of molecules since both behave as waves the easiest solution would be that physical forces on physical things create wavelike behaviors rather than that its magic you are knocking down a strawman
   quantum eraser experiment is invalid because the path of light passes through bsa or bsb in order to always behave a certain way whereas it merely reflects off of bsa or bsb when it acts the other way the narrator here claims the paths are the same but passing through seems different than reflecting off he makes it seem like knowing this difference between the stations is the cause rather than that the difference between them is the cause
bump
  google says theres a medium in space but its random dust and gasses so its not space itself  youre confusing the interstellar medium with space itself the ism is the dust and hydrogen plasma that floats between stars  if you could zoom into empty space down to the quantum level you would see the quantum foam which is virtual particles popping in and out of existence because the energy of a vacuum is nonzero
  a particle doesnt need a medium to travel through  a particle is an excitation of its field its not separate from it
  but are virtual particles actually real in any sense
  yes and no   theyre potentials you can do things that force virtual particles to become actual particles like introducing horizons this is where things like hawking radiation comes from
  moskali must hang
look up hyugens principle there are many videos on it
what happens if you have 3 slits
  youll get an interference pattern
  if you really want to fry your brain pass light through three polarized filters at different orientations and see if the results are what youd expect
  how do i punch space itself and measure the effect this experiment is needed to prove your claim not virtual foam
  whats the field made of
  virtual particles   look up the sea of dirac for a good metaphor to wrap your noodle around
  how do i punch space itself and measure the effect  with a particle accelerator
everything everyone says to you is bullshit you cant explain it fully unless you know the math that goes into it its like trying to describe the number 2 without knowing what numbers are
  thats bullshit the effects observed arent from punching space itself but rather two standard materials at high speed
why does /sci/ look down at codemonkeys
codemonkeys  not science or math
  hitting ctrlc ctrlv over and over again is monkey behavior
  through the taxes of hard working coders like me science gets funding  show some fucking respect
its because sci values rigiorous intelligence over everything else    most people dont they couldnt care less about intelligence over the baseline of average to slightly above average    scinis also salty that their highly values rigiorous intelligence lands them in relatively low paying occupations and low social status
    code monkeys cant even be called as a programmers they are like end users who just happen to know to how to code and connect existing libraries and tools

is this guy a meme or does he have a point
    tldr theres a few problems to sort out that arent policy related
how much can we say that intellegence is a learned power and not something we are only born to have an iq test would get higher score from someone who eg attended to school than someone who just played video games not the best example but its about the same as someone who nurtured hes own intellegence and did everything to stimulate his intellect than one that did nearly nothing which comes to mean that one is not automaticly smartest just by itself intellegence must be nurtured and stimulated to be kept in check and up to date to achieve high iq no one can do the hardest calculations we know today in iq tests without at least basic math so one got the logic of how math works and very few has eg brilliant linguistics without ever reading a book and or practiced vokabulary very rare but how far can an average brain matter go and how much does a genius need to do to score genius iq so one should really consider iq tests plausible and give it alittlebit less credidentials than what people are proclaiming it to have i guess i proved my point now just had to say it iq tests are shit it means almost zero to nothing even a brainlet can learn enough that he becomes a superb scientistic theorist prove me wrong faggots
  an iq test would get higher score from someone who eg attended to school than someone who just played video games    citation needed
  i agree that came out abit wrong i should have said one that have done nothing vs a schooled person on a iq test
  so one should really consider iq tests plausible and give it alittlebit less credidentials than what people are proclaiming it to have i guess i proved my point now just had to say it iq tests are shit it means almost zero to nothing  true its just a funny /sci/ meme that makes people butthurt dont take those threads seriously its all trolls
  i agree
  no one can do the hardest calculations we know today in iq tests without at least basic math so one got the logic of how math works    and you cant do an iq test without the ability to   read and write but that doesnt mean that being able to read the questions is contributing to iq      i guess i proved my point now  all you proved is you need to practise your english better      iq tests are shit it means almost zero to nothing  which is why they are the best predictors we have of academic and occupational success      iq is one of our most heritable traits and in adulthood shows a heritibility of about 6080  we obviously need some basic knowledge and skills to do an iq test health obviously has an effect the type of environment you were exposed to growing up obviously has some effect but iq is substantially genetic everyone doesnt start off on equal ground
hey /sci/ i was just wondering why it seems to be a fact that this book pic related seems to still be popular    the physics emphasized in this book the bootstrap program has been quite unsuccessful whereas quantum chromodynamics which the book seems to shit on was extremely extremely successful at predicting basically everything about quarks and gluons    why is this still a meme new age genxers still trying to read their generations books pretty pathetic
  never heard of it
  never heard of it and i teach extracurricular maths/physics to undergraduates including griffithsinspired intro to qcd   pretty pathetic   more pathetic is you judging by your post having approximately similar level of knowledge about quarks and gluons as those who read this trash and yet you decide to mock brainlets instead of reading up on qft   you are the brainlet anon git gud and come join my classes or similar

so if you look at the wikipedia article for this and common understanding its that this question does not have a definite answer because it can be interpreted differently but that is incorrect the answer is an unambiguous 50    one of the two is a guaranteed boy the other is a 50 boy or girl so you put together the list of outcomes    100 boy then 50 boy   100 boy then 50 girl  50 boy then 100 boy  50 girl then 100 boy    as you can see of the 4 outcomes there are two in which both are boys so the answer is 1/2 i do not see how any other formulation or interpretation is possible to claim that the answer is 1/3 is simply to interpret the question wrong
your proof is implicitly assuming that child a or b are distinguishable in the problem outside of gender which is incorrect 100 boy 50 boy is the same as   50 boy 100 boy
yeah its two independent variables if you assume the first is known and the second is not influenced by the first so the answer is 50 of course under the assumption of 50/50 chances for all kids which is actually not true but w/e just an assumption    the answer would be different if one kid werent set in stone but it is
  ohhhhh
i dont understand the probability is just 75 isnt that obvious
  read   
  whats your iq
  absolutely no idea but i have dyscalculia and cant do any math involving the number 7 that isnt 73 nor can i multiply or divide except with really basic stuff that i only really know vis memorization
  but this is incorrect girl/girl should not even be considered because we already know that at least one is a boy girl/girl is impossible and thus not among the outcomes
  whats 72    girl/girl  gg isnt part of the calculation of 1/3 lol
  assuming equal probability for boy or girl    his first kid has a 50/50 chance of either    if the first kid is a girl then the second must be a boy with 100 likelihood  so 50 chance you dont have both boys    if his first kid is a boy then theres another 50 chance that the other one is a boy but theres no guarantee of either one since weve already satisfied at least one is a boy    so theres a 25 chance that the second kid is a girl and a 25 chance its a boy this is the only important one since we care about boyboy    so its a quarter probability      but one of the kids is guaranteed to be a boy so the other one is the only one that matters  50 chance its a boy and you have boyboy    so its half probability because probability fucking sucks massive ass and is full of bullshit
  but by saying the probability that both are boys is 1/4 this is only possible if both children being girls was a possibility since that is not possible it cannot be 1/4 and thus his calculation is wrong
rtards  out of 100 couples we expect  50 bg  25 bb and 25 gg  if we remove those 25 gg we are left with 25/75 or 1/3  clearly would tend to 1/3 with bigger numbers  alternatively you just picture the tree  its really trivial
    on the bottom he calculates pb1  pb2  pbb since there is no pgg this should be 100 but he has it as 3/4
  what
  its like coin tossing you subhuman  after two tossings theres 1/4 for heads 1/4 for tails and 2/4 for tails  heads  if we remove the possiblity for both tails we are left with hh at 1/3 and th at 2/3
  theres 1 event you illiterate fucking retard read the problem
  so if we toss twice for 100 times we expect  50 results to be ht  25 tt and  25 hh  if we consider only double tossings with h in them theres 75 left  out of those 75 25 are hh thus 25/75 or 1/3
  but if they have a girl first then theyre guaranteed to be a boy next so bb  bg  25 and gb  50    since having a boy first is a 50 chance and having a girl first is 50 chance    so its a quarter again
  it does not make sense that he is considering this as the four possibilities    boy/boy  boy/girl  girl/boy  girl/girl    the fourth option is something we already know is impossible it would be wrong to say then that the answer is 1/3 because you are simply scratching the fourth option out the fact that one of them is a guaranteed boy means that the 4 possibilities are akin to what is listed in op    guaranteed boy/random boy  guaranteed boy/random girl  random boy/guaranteed boy  random girl/guaranteed boy    in 2 of these both are boys thus 1/2 the probability that one is a boy is guaranteed 100 that is what must be factored
  kys
  random boy/guaranteed boy  if you have a random boy first then the next slot isnt guaranteed
  prove me wrong pussy ass bitch    flawless
  flawless  its not it counts gb the same as bg  but gb is twice as likely since you dont do the second trial ending with b is guaranteed
  i dont even know what the pointed up arrow means
so basically the answer is 1/2 because 100 boy and 50 boy are actually two different variables when people say 1/3 they are incorrectly saying that in a boy/boy outcome they are both the same variable despite the fact they have two different probabilities of occuring
  if the next slot is a girl then this means the first boy was the guaranteed one
    leave brainlet
  i just flipped a coin twice what are the odds that i got tails twice now i tell you my first flip was heads obviously given the information now you would say getting tails twice is impossible thats only the case because you have the conditional information i just gave you me flipping a head does not then retroactively change the chance of getting tails twice to zero this is what you are saying you are saying that the first child was 100 guaranteed to be a boy at birth a ridiculous assumption
  if you have a random boy first then the next slot isnt guaranteed  but heres the point you dont know if the first boy is the random one or the guaranteed one the answer 1/3 only makes sense if you assume the first boy is always the guaranteed one but there is no reason to make this assumption
questions like this are a problem because fuckers havent studied probabilities properly    a what is the outcome space well its bb bg gb this assumes two random variables one for each child     b what is the probability distribution since we have two independent random variables just take a simple joint distribution so each outcome turns out to have prob of 1/3 since the gg has prob 0     the rest of the proof is left as an exercise for the curious high schooler    ps the possible point of confusion that wikipedo alludes to is probably about describing the outcome space and treating them as dependent or independent variables
  but telling us the first flip makes it a different problem entirely the point is that one of the flips is 100 guaranteed to be heads
  theres no distiction between the two theyre identical members of the set of possible children
pboy and boy  pboy guaranteed  pboy  boy guaranteed  classical probability assumptions must be held the child will be born either a boy or girl and cannot be born a boy and girl two possible outcomes exist therefore probability of boy  1/2 therefore complementary event girl  1/2  pboy guaranteed  1/1  1  pboy  boy guaranteed  boy/boy or girl  1/2  pboy and boy  1  1/2  1/2
  thx god someone else who is not mentally challenged
  if we assume in the population the mixed gender set is equal in size to the same gender set then the answer must be 1/3
  so each outcome turns out to have prob of 1/3  no if you have a girl first theres a 50 chance and youre guaranteed to end with a boy so gb is a 50 chance      ur braindead    
  but there is a distinction we already know that one of them is a guaranteed boy  but not which one if the first child is a boy you still dont know if this was the guaranteed boy or the random one
  youre just claiming theres a distinction without showing it    you are guaranteed _a_ boy if you have one boy already you have fulfilled that  you have a 50 chance of a boy or a girl next since youve already satisfied the guarantee
  you are claiming a conditional when none exists you are guaranteed a boy but you have no way of knowing if it would be the first or second child the first child being a boy could simply be a boy out of chance or the one you are guaranteed you dont know which you are assuming we can know that the first boy was the guaranteed one
  youre assuming the two variables are not independent then check the post scriptum
  go easy on him he prolly got dropped on his head and stomped by his nigger mother
i have a box with two tokens which can be value g or b i draw a b token and do not replace what is the probability the second token is a b
    you two are actually fucking retarded  there is no guaranteed one  one of the boys isnt fucking holy  you are sure to have atleast one boy first or second is irrelevant you catatonic ingrates
  50 percent
  what is your outcome space what are you random variables and what is your probability space
  you have a 50 chance of a boy or a girl next since youve already satisfied the guarantee  exactly and thats why the answer is 50 overall because the sex of the second child is not determined by the first
  because the sex of the second child is not determined by the first  it _is_ if the first child was a female      i made the diagram 
okay dont panic but there are people on this board who dont understand bayes theorem
  75
  so now you are arguing that in this scenario the second child would be a holy guaranteed 100 boy simply because the first was a girl
  so your variables are not independent since in the bottom half you assign a probability based on the value of a previous outcome
    you are making the mistake of assuming that we can only look at the first child if there are two kids and you tell me one of them is a boy then the only two scenarios left are boy/boy and boy/girl whether that boy you told me about was first born or second born this makes absolutely no difference
  youre guaranteed one boy if you only have one slot left and no boys you need a boy there      yeah      yeah thats the paradox the diagram and the rearrangement dont agree cuz probability sucks ass
lets try an experiment    heres randomorg generating 100 pairs of integers uniformly picking 1 or 2      now heres some questions for the class  1 how many pairs have at least one 2  2 how many have two 2s
why are people acting like girlboy and boygirl are distinct scenarios the point is that it is revealed that one of them is a boy as of now that is the only information you have people here are saying if the first is a girl then the second must be a boy but when are we ever told there was a girl at all the gender of one child is revealed and we must now guess the gender of the other since its not condition the answer is 50
  heres my answers class    1 76  2 21
  if the first is a girl then the second must be a boy but when are we ever told there was a girl at all  were told theres a girl in the assumption you just made if the first is a girl
  we are not told there is a girl we are told there is a 50 possibility that the other child is a girl     the only scenarios are boyboy and boygirl there is no girlboy scenario to consider because we are only told about the boy and now must guess the other there is no reason to think this is a conditional problem you are told that one is a boy and whether it came first or second makes absolutely no difference
  we are told there is a 50 possibility that the other child is a girl  we were not told that at all what we know is that the prior probability of a given child being a girl is 50 though its never explicitly stated
the realest of niggas know its 2/3  you cannot know why it is hidden knowledge
  we are not told there is a girl  im agreeing with you if there is a girl tho you must have the other be a boy thats how the if statement works    but if there is a girl doesnt mean there will be a girl
  i worded the last sentence poorly    when you consider if there is a girl you dont know there will be one but if there is then the other must be a boy
  did you just assume my gender the thread
  but we are never told about the girl first thats the point there is no if girl then boy scenario its either if boy then girl or if boy then boy you are never told about a girl first
  the possibilities for her children are bb bg gb and gg gg is ignored because given information contradicts it  out of the three remaining possibilities only one has two boys thus 1/3
  youre told the other is a 50 boy or girl besides the guarantee you arent told the guarantee happens first it just happens somewhere
  why are you treating bg as a different value from gb   the male sibling is irrelevant because you already know its a boychild no one cares if its older or younger than the other sibling just if the other sibling has a penis or a vagina   your choice is b/g
  mr smith how many children do you have  2  do you have any sons  yes  mr smith has two children at least one is a boy what is the probability that both children are boys
  but what you are getting wrong is that birth order is totally irrelevant there is no if girl then boy scenario the scenario is we know there is a boy and the other is a boy or girl since order doesnt matter the options are bb or bg
the problem is the girl is actually a boy
are you all retarded  the order of the births literally dont matter whatsoever  we know that one of the two is a boy so wlog i flip a coin for the other one  50/50   anyone who doesnt realize this is obfuscating themselves with fake mathematics statistics instead of just doing this simple proof  were talking about a set here not an ordered pair you dumb fucks
  you dont need to treat them as different values it just makes it easier to think about for brainlets  if you treat them as one value bg for which order does not matter the answer is still 1/3 because bg is weighted twice as it encompasses two equally likely distinct permutations      bg happens twice as often as bb 1/3
so the people who disagree with 1/3 they assume some smarmy fuck is using a convoluted way of saying he is holding the first kid and knows the state of the first kid and the unknown state is simply the state of the second kid  sortof like this picture    rather than at least one being a completely logicbased statement about the variables in question
  whether the guarantee happens first or second is irrelevant you know that one is a boy with 100 certainty the only question is whether the other child is a boy or girl knowing that one of them is a boy does not change the fact that the certainty of the other child is still 50
  as it encompasses two equally likely distinct permutations  its entirely irrelevant to the question though no one is asking you how many permutations of children she can have the question is what are the odds that her other child is also a boy
  that probability is the probability without it being given that at least one is a boy
  there are no permutations because the order doesnt matter bg  gb  the only possibilities are   bb bg   50/50
  and the other scenario is logical with a magical genie telling a man that with his next two children one of them is guaranteed to be a boy
  it makes perfect sense if you have ever had even a tiny bit of set theory and predicate logic
what is the probability that both children are boys  the answer to this question is still 1/4 because the probability of having two boys is the same regardless of knowing that one of them is a boy already  now if the question is what is the probability of you guessing correctly that both children are boys that is different    but 25 is not the brainlet answer it is the only answer that actually addresses the semantics of the question
   is the probability that both children are boys  the answer to this question is still 1/4 because the probability of having two boys is the same regardless of knowing that one of them is a boy already  you can not just wish away information if you have information then you have to condition on it
  but you still cant discount the 1/2 people by coming up with a ridiculous real world scenario a real world scenario that forced you to think of terms of set theory for the status of two kids would still be really stupid
  no thats literally not the actual question you idiot the question is what is the probability that both of her children are boys and the information given is that the situation where she has two girls cannot happen  at least one of her children is a boy does not mean the entire thing should be interpreted as she already has a boy whats the chance shell have another thats fucking retarded all it does is tell you to exclude the gg possibility    heres a basic lesson in critical thinking  if a happens twice as often as b the chance of b happening has to be half the chance of a happening
what is the probability that a couple with exactly two children has two boys    what is the probability that a couple with exactly two children has at least one boy    what is the probability that a couple with exactly two children has at least one boy given that they have two boys
  by this logic the answer is 1/2 because you cannot wish away the fact you know that one is a boy already
  you know one child is a boy the only information you can glean from this is that the children are not both girls no more no less
  the information given is that the combination can either be boygirl or boyboy there is no reason to think that order actually matters
    class i am very disappointed in you not one of you turned in the assignment
  order doesnt matter what does matter is that the prior probability of boygirl was twice the prior probability of boyboy
  25  50  100    people who say 75 to the second question dont understand that the order doesnt matter
  question 2 is ambiguously worded it could be either 1/2 or 1/3 depending on whether the couple is going to have children or has had the children already
  oops not 1/3 i mean 2/3
  at least one of her children is a boy does not mean the entire thing should be interpreted as she already has a boy whats the chance shell have another thats fucking retarded all it does is tell you to exclude the gg possibility  it doesnt matter whether or not she already has a boy you know the set is b x and the x is either a boy or a girl were not talking about an ordered pair where bg is different from gb  there are only two possibilities you can either pull the set of bb or the set of gb its a coin toss  youre writing out the problem as though  bb  bg  gb   gg   are all unique and then crossing out the last one and then performing the calculation but the middle two are not different as we already know that one element will be b and we can consider the final result wlog so its actually  bg  gb  gg   with the final one cut out so its 50/50  if a happens twice as often as b the chance of b happening has to be half the chance of a happening  except a is not happening twice as often as b as bg is not different from gb we are not talking about permutations
  im not saying that order matters stop pulling that out of your ass    if a couple has two children and they arent both girls whats the chance that theyre a boy and a girl
if you were to flip a coin twice and know that you were certain to get heads once what is the probability that you would get heads twice in a row    heads and tails are equally likely    if you flip h first you have either h or t next 25 chance of both ht and hh right  if you flip t first since youre certain of getting h once th is 50 likely since it only depends on the first coin      no one cares that order doesnt matter because thats only used to simplify the question so you have less to deal with i dealt with them separately to make sure i didnt miss anything but that doesnt mean anything    flipping a coin one at a time twice and flipping 2 coins are the same so i cant split it up like that
  what parts ambiguous a couple having exactly two children or a couple having at least one boy
  50 percent because its either two boys or a boy and girl
  1 1/2  1/2  1/4  2 px1  px2  25  3 are you actually retarded
  wrong
  what is the probability that a couple with exactly two children has at least one boy    3/4
  but there is no way of knowing for certain you could get heads once this is why looking at this as a conditional problem is not an intuitive way of looking at it
  are you actually retarded  you just said that theres only a 25 chance that theres at least one boy i think you should look in a mirror before asking this of someone setting up people to use bayes theorem
  i should do something better with my life
  you see you make a mistake in your final cut  bg cannot be equivalent to bb because bg encompasses two equivalent but independent possibilities there are more ways that one child can be a boy and the other a girl than there are ways both children are boys      wrong let me ask this again  if event a is twice as likely to occur as event b whats the probability that event a will occur
  1/4  1/4  1
  if the parents havent had kids yet its a conditional problem if they have kids order doesnt matter if no kids yet there are 4 possibilities    bg  bb  gb  gg    but if they already had kids the order is irrelevant you just need to know if one of their two kids is a boy it could either be two boys two girls or a boy and girl so the answer would be 2/3 there is no need to consider gb and bg as separate scenarios
  okay i at least see what your point is but its nonsense to pretend that two boys has the same probability as one boy and one girl after the kids have been born
  show your math my dude
  if you compress bg and gb into one scenario it must be given the combined probability that both held independently  just because they produce equivalent results doesnt mean one of them is trivial and can be discarded
  2/3
  at least one means one or more probability of exactly one boy is 50 probability of exactly two boys is 25 probability of three or more is obviously zero since these are all mutually exclusive this means there is a 75 chance of at least one boy
  the probability is not about the probability of who would be born right now  it is about which of the possible universes you are in conditional on the information you have been given trying to think of physical kids that already exist and unbirthing them in your head and birthing them again is completely irrelevant
  i cant fucking believe i was the only one to say it was 75    and i thought i was retarded thanks for the self image boost /sci/
  but they are equivalent    just because they produce equivalent results doesnt mean one of them is trivial and can be discarded  how does it not mean this
  i flip two fair coins cover them with a cup and ask you what the probability is that theyre both heads would you say 1/3
  precisely
either 100 if the other child is a boy or 0 if not these are the only two possible correct answers 50 and 1/3 are both wrong because mr smith already knows the answer ask mr smith
  if you had three factories a b and b  b and b produce the same amount of candy so the total amount of candy is a  b  b  a  2b  a  2b not a  b
  has anyone tested it  like taking every family with 2 kids from a small city removing the ones where both are girls and then seeing how many have two boys
  can i interest you in a homework assignment  
  in absense of additional information saying 1/4th would match the proportion of times both coins would turn out to have landed heads in the long run     if at least one of the coins landed heads hh ht th and i am given information that the outcome is one of those then if i were to say 1/3rd then it would correspond to the proportion of times hh was the case in the long run
  because thats how statistics work
  ill try spacing this out in a way you can better comprehend    bg  the results are one boy and one girl  the ways this can happen boygirl and girlboy  bb  the results are two boys  the ways this can happen boyboy    list of things that can happen  boyboy  girlboy  boygirl    list of results from those things  two boys  one boy and one girl    the probability of result one boy and one girl is twice the probability of result two boys  because there are two things that can happen that lead to that result    when two things lead to the same result they both still need to be considered because they both can happen to cause that result
are children bosons or fermions
  even if you only care about the number of boys and girls at the end you need to pay attention to how those numbers are arrived at  if there are more ways to arrive at a pair of final numbers those final numbers have to be more likely to be arrived at
  if event a is twice as likely to occur as event b whats the probability that event a will occur  if one of the children is a boy that leaves you with  boyboy  boygirl  sure you could argue that a boygirl combination is twice as likely to occur as boyboy but thats only when you are considering the odds of having two children in a row would be if you are simply trying to guess what the persons other child is 50 is a reasonable answer its essentially asking the question he has two kids one of them is a boy now guess if the other kid is a boy or girl boy or girl two options 1/2 you are not necessarily meant to think of it in combination with the first boy
  the question is not what is the probability of a second child being a boy  it is specifically what is the probability that of two children both children are boys if it is true that both are not girls  you fucking dunce
two different questions  what are the chances that the other kid is a boy  and  what are the chances of having two boys in a row    i think it could be interpreted either way
  it is not our fault you are too brainlet to not tunnelvision into locking the first child into slot a in your head and then concluding that the second child only has one possible slot to go into
  the question just says at least one of her children is a boy  the boy could be her firstborn her secondborn or both of them  there are three possibilities of who the boy could be and only one of them is that both are the boy so 1/3
if only there were some sort of way to generate random numbers and run an experiment to check
  what are the chances that the other kid is a boy  50 given in ops post      there isnt a way to generate random numbers
  see 
  people implement something else than what the op states and then claims that just because it answers 50 that is the answer to op
  it is specifically what is the probability that of two children both children are boys if it is true that both are not girls  but its the same question if both are not girls that leaves you with boyboy or boygirl 50/50 why exactly should boygirl and girlboy be considered separate its eitheror either they are both boys or one is a boy and one is a girl it doesnt matter who was born first
  leaves you with boyboy or boygirl   yes  50/50  no
  the point is that the slot is irrelevant whether the boy is first or second born you still just have a boy/boy or boy/girl scenario
  the question says that at least one of her children is a boy  the boy could be her first her second or both of them  what is the probability that the boy is her first or second child
  this is fucking amazing a paradox that isnt a paradox or even anything its just a description of the fact that if you set up a question with misleading wording people lean toward the wrong answer woah dude paradoxical    of course there are goobers like op who dont know what the fuck theyre saying lmao you cant put probabilities inside the outcomes lol outcomes events are things that definitely occur
  just because you have 2 options bb and bg doesnt mean they have the same probability    are you actually this stupid    you win the lottery or you dont its not a 50 chance of either tho
  but the question is not asking you what the children will be it is asking you what they are
  this is /thread
  you win the lottery or you dont its not a 50 chance of either tho  keep thinking this povertyfags i even bought two tickets which means im guaranteed to win
  yeah its figuring out who the boy is child 1 or 2 or both whats the probability hes child 1
  oh fuck hes bamboozled me folks
  just because something already happened does not mean you can not use probabilities to reason about your own uncertainty
  poor people dont understand this
  there are three possibilities of who the boy could be  doesnt matter who he is what is the chance that his sibling is male or female
  this simple trick is making anon rich and lotto max is furious
what the fuck is this thread the question is ambiguous you cant just ignore one interpretation and assume the other is correct
  if every family with two children and at least one boy sends exactly one of their sons to you and you ask them if their sibling is a boy or girl 2/3 will say girl    if every family with exactly two children and at least one boy sends all their sons to you and you ask them if their sibling is a boy or a girl 1/2 will say girl
  first should also say exactly two the different wording is not intended
lmao i cant believe people on fucking /sci/ think its 1/2  ive been teasing the shit out of 1/2brainlets on /int/ and /v/ for the last few days and its hilarious how stupid and yet adamant they are  i went on a whole measure theory tirade just to fuck with one anon who had told me that he understood probability and i agreed and constructed a probability measure where the answer is unambiguously 1/2 idk it was some sort of unordered version of the product measure  he just got really mad and said i was trying deliberately to confuse him and that he was a master of probability so i asked him what he does for a living  and youll never fucking believe it he said he was a software engineer  a fucking codemonkey was trying to tell me off for using big scary math words  these threads are the fucking best
/sci/ is filled with retards who think theyre the next gift to mankind the anti evolution thread has been main paging all day
  hey friend i like the way you spell words keep it up
  thank fren
  tested monty hall once on different boards  /b/  /v/  /tg/  /sci/
  /thread was like 100 posts ago with this explanation  
        the two interpretations  you have 2 children we know that the first child is a boy therefore the chance of the second child being a boy is 50/50    or    there are 2 children we dont know which child is a boy therefore there are 2 different outcomes that give you a boy and girl and only one that gives you boy/boy so the chance is 1/3 it is not 1/4 as you are adding that an extra option and then ignoring it rather than writing the three available options as 1/3
  we know that the first child is a boy  how does this interpretation make any sense given the problem wording
  i think its lees we know the first child is a boy and more we sampled one child and found it was a boy i know that doesnt sound intuitive but if you asked someone to imagine a series of events which describe the problem its what theyre likely to end up with
the actual probabilty of both children are boys is 53 bc human sex ratio at birth is about that it does not matter which child is older it is out of context all people who will disagree with me are either brainlets or trolls from 4chan
  yes but mortality for fuccbois is higher than for girls so it evens out
  thats too hard
  but if they have a girl first then theyre guaranteed to be a boy next  no they could still have a girl theyd just then be excluded from the probability thats calculated at the end
  most likely mr smiths children are still young which means their sex ratio still preserves at 104107 boys per girl and also most likely he lives in a developed country which is implied by his surname sex ratio starts to even out after 30 because today we dont have as many global destructive wars as back then and violent crime rates are relatively low
  without it being given that at least one is a boy  how can you calculate without that when that is the case you are calculating the answer in a world that doesnt exist and then translating it into the real world but you cant do that
    by that logic you can never assume you will have 2 kids or 1 unless you already have them because you may die before having the kids or the earth may explode    but the point of logic is working with assumptions and with the given assumptions the answer is 50
the answer is 1/4 i dont understand how knowing that at least one is a boy actually changes the chances of both of his children being boys if he has two kids there is still a 3/4 chance of this not happening regardless of what we are told    people here seem to be saying 1/3 because you are assuming that one of them is guaranteed to be a boy as if we have some magical knowledge that one of his two children will be a boy no matter what but this is a weird assumption that i dont think the problem would be asking if his first child is a girl the chances of him having a boy next are still 1/2
  people who say 75 to the second question dont understand that the order doesnt matter  if the answer to the second question is 50 then the probability that they have two girls is 50 since thats the only other possibility but youve already said that the probability of having two boys is 25 how can there be a difference between the probability of having two boys and the probability of having two girls
  wrong  take each statement of the problem step by step the actual fucking wording of the question  1 there is a couple with two children  so you find the four possibilities and list them  2 at least one of them is a boy   this means you rule out any possibilities that do not have at least one boy  3 finally you find the probability that both are boys based on your current workspace because thats what the question is asking
  people here seem to be saying 1/3 because you are assuming that one of them is guaranteed to be a boy as if we have some magical knowledge that one of his two children will be a boy no matter what  yes thats what this question is about its saying weve thrown out the possibility that theyve had two girls
    just because we know he has at least one boy this does not mean the chance of him having two girls was impossible the fact he has at least one boy is something that had a 75 chance of occurring not 100 if i flip two coins and i tell you at least one was heads are you going to say the chances of this occurring were 100 of course not thus the answer is 1/4
  wrong  two people exist it is given that at least one of them is male  this does not mean there is a 75 chance that one of them is male
this is a bad name it should be called the periodic table of atoms atoms not elements they are represented by their atomic number and their atomic weight
atoms are not the same as elements what youre saying exists but is called a table of nuclides they look like this
hes not wrong you know
based and redpilled tbqhwyf
people can do whatever the fuck they want if climate changes worries you you are always free to do something about it just let other people keep doing on their own
accomplishing a task that you could probably handle using newtonian physics is the same as making predictions about a complex chaotic system    this really is scientism
  people can do whatever the fuck they want if being murdered worries you you are always free to do something about it just let other people keep doing on their own
  you are always free to do something about it just let other people keep doing on their own  anon are you retarded every government in the world already has environmental rules and there are international agreements on universal environmental rules it doesnt work if one guy can say fuck it and start a china syndrome or something
  if something requires collective problem solving then it cant possibly be a real problem
  no the categorical imperative says that other people must do the moral thing as well and if they refuse its not just individual preference but they are acting immoral and it is my moral duty to kill them
  anyone who has played a game of catch with their father wont be too surprised by that im not sure why youd be surprised by that mr tyson
  and this thing got solar panels
  hes not even wrong i still like him
  hes not wrong  nah my nigger
smartass
  oh yes mister president man please take away all the progress we were making to mitigate climate change i like it when you use your big authoritarian cock to fuck literally every human being on earth    how do you brainlets not realize that climate change denialism is literally the most advanced form of cuckoldry there is
  of course they have rules that is easy and cheap that does not mean they ever intended to enforce them as the swiss discovered in their atmospheric observatory a while ago
  hes not wrong you know  he is wrong because it isnt new science are we supposed to be congratulating scientists when they keep doing the same stuff landing something on mars cant be that hard when it was done 50 years ago with the viking program
  rightwing retards are so fucking stupid lol
  i dont listen to rapists
  i dont listen to rapists
  alright then let me just go to the houses of the financial elite and ill just murder them
when the solution to climate change extends beyond taxing the proles to give money to rich buddies let me know until then its a fucking scam
  not an argument please tell me more about how carbon taxes will save the planet
  solution to climate change extends beyond taxing the proles  moving oil subsidies to renewables
  the same phenomena that enable stealth aircraft is also responsible for global warming
  let me know when that happens until then all the presented solution are moar taxes
  if you give us 100 billion dollars we can throw rocks really really far by burning expensive fuel  therefore anything we say should be accepted as fact  this seems like quite the leap from a to b no one disputes that the climate has been drastically changing ever since the earths inception there is heavy doubt on the hypothesis that humans control the worlds overall weather patterns though as the giant energy and oil corporations have been claiming and paying to advertise for the past 30 years climate change is the largest corporation in the worlds pet project general electric and youre a useful idiot
  the solution to climate change is to give general electric money  youre a fucking idiot but general electric was right to spend billions over three decades on this kind of propaganda they were right to control an entire wing of cable television as they did it too  fuck you for empowering the most evil people in the world
  engineers could do their job competently so that means were right about agw    i hope no one takes this post to mean that im disputing the existence of global warming but that is a rotten argument to make for it science black guy can do better than that
  thats still a moar taxes solution anon subsidies come from taxation general electric doesnt want a free competitive market it wants no bid contracts to build huge solar plants and wind farms you should look up their profit margin from green energy and then realize how much of a scam it is
  us  everyone with the tag scientist or engineer should be believed no matter what they say because nasa spent 30 billion dollars to launch a long distance firework
  we built the pyramids believe us when we tell you ra the sun god will punish if you do not listen
  what are you talking about anon that answer has nothing to do with my comment
  realistically the solution is just going to be oh its now more economical for me to buy an electric car cause these companies developed cheap and efficient technologies
  just stop living a life that relies as heavily on fucking up the environment  i could be a better person but i wont due to something unrelated  carbon taxes are there to force change on nihilists and other people with poor moral standards
  moving all subsidies to renewables  nothing to do with general electric  except thats wrong because thats exactly what subsidizing green energy even more than it already is means green energy doesnt need more subsidy it needs less it should be zero subsidy to green energy because green energy is a scam and thats why it requires subsidies to exist in the first place
  carbon taxes are there to redistribute wealth any other justification is a lie
  please tell me more about basic fucking supply and demand  the fact that increasing the price of something will decrease consumption is common sense economics that you shouldnt need explained to you i know this is /sci/ not /biz/ but youve got to be a real fucking brainlet to need that explained to you
  carbon taxes are there to force change on nihilists and other people with poor moral standards    no they are there to extort more money out of the working class to give it to their rich buddies through corrupt schemes    have to drive 100km to work everyday  get taxed even more on fuel because carbon tax  dont like it just spend 50100k on a new electric car you fucking nihilist lol    kill yourself if you unironically support this
  you cant decrease consumption of essential products you fucking retard yeah im sure people will buy less food because it is now more expensive thanks to carbon taxes
  seems like its starting to become pretty competitive to me  
  calls others retards  literally doesnt understand the most basic and fundamental aspects of the economy  when energyefficient food is cheaper than food that uses a lot of resources people will buy more of the former and less of the latter when gas prices go up people will drive less when electricity goes up people will turn their lights off  youre too stupid to even bother arguing with if you cant understand something as basic as this
  you dont know fucking anything these carbon taxes will increase the price of fucking everything your energy efficient food still has to be fertilised with petrochemicals transported via road and sea using fossil fuels until you can replace millions of trucks and ships with electrical variants which is a long way off and refrigerated using carbon taxed energy at every step    people cant just drive less the vast majority of household fuel usage is consumed with the daily commute what is your solution to that every household just drop tens of thousands on new electrical cars which they cant afford maybe they could move closer to the city into a more expensive house which they also cant afford    when electricity goes up people will turn their lights off  implying lights account for even 5 of your energy usage    im sure granny will understand why her house has to be cold now because paying taxes to corrupt old boys club is totally saving the environment
  if thats true theres no need for a carbon tax or any government regulation as the green energy will outcompete co2 polluters
  all food uses an identical amount of energy and it is impossible to reduce energy consumption at any point in the process  100 of driving is mandatory people never drive for any other purpose  mass transit isnt a thing  buying local isnt a thing  renewable energy isnt a thing  i swear its like conservitards just live in a fantasy world
  energy can neither be created or destroyed
  yep
  you are engaging in pilpul and ignoring my points carbon tax is not a viable solution look at paris right now that is what happens when you try to implement it maybe you could come up with a solution that doesnt involve extorting the common man for the purpose of redistributing it to the rich
  look at paris right now  what about it    ignorant and spoiled rural retards are driving into the city causing mayhem
  ignoring my points  your point is that one of the fundamental rules of economics is a lie and that consumption is completely independent of price your point is fucking retarded  maybe you could come up with a solution that doesnt involve extorting the common man for the purpose of redistributing it to the rich  the rich are the most wasteful and would be hit the hardest companies would have to adopt more energy efficient processes to keep prices competitive and taxes could be used to subsidize mass transit and renewables to help the common man
  not to defend /pol/niggers but the fundamental laws of economics dont mean anything at all and invoking them to push for carbon taxes which largely end up harming middle class people the worst and making food prices spike is fucking stupid the best way to combat co2 production is to make it illegal not something you can pay a fine for
  scientists taking credit for engineers accomplishments  this is nothing new
  america is fucking fat it would be a good thing if food prices spiked and people had to start walking instead of driving
  just walk 50 miles to work bro
  more employers will allow telecommuting more people will decide that its fucking stupid to live 50 miles away from where you work
  more employers will allow telecommuting    have you tried asking to telecommute in the current year most companies will absolutely not allow a telecommute and this is also only viable if your job is 100 computer based which the majority of jobs are not    more people will decide that its fucking stupid to live 50 miles away from where you work    cool so they have to stack another 50100k on their mortgage to buy a house closer to the city banks will fucking love this
  your job is 100 computer based  the job rodney williams not rodelene williams and i discussed in 2016 was a job of this variety i remember shortly after i quit spicer said something in some video its not over until you come sign this paperwork and it memed to me that their position at exide spicer seemed like rod in this video was that i had not terminated my employment or not terminated some fraud arrangement which they enacted through fraud     its not up them to tell me i cant quit unless i sign a document and all of their fraud is out of my hands would be only between them and those from whom they derive their impunity     walking out on the job is so wellknown as a form of voluntary termination of employment that walking out on the job is even a metaphorical saying indeed it was so obvious to exides hr department that i had quit that they terminated my pay a day or two after i walked out if spicers message was a statement of his contrary belief then i will be happy to prove him wrong  
the dataset in this pic      is likely a few indexes like giss which show a completely different temperature trend than the direct measurement of the temperature of the air with satellites      some guy dled giss from nasa in the 1990s then he dled the same dataset and subtracted them you can see pic related a curve has been artificially added in the temperature index which is called an index instead of a measurement because the measured data gets altered before it is reported in front of trump to make it appear different than the more or less directly measured uah dataset  the truth about climate change  
  false equivalence aside the only reason im skeptical about the climate change models that end up being put forward are because most of the ones put towards the public are the absolute worst case scenarios if even that there have been dozens of instances where people have been caught falsifying data to produce models that are well beyond the worst case scenario either for political reasons or because fearmongering is a good way to keep their labs open    im not a complete cynic about it i think that we should do what we can within reason to keep an eye on climate change and to try to mitigate and reverse the negative effects of it where and when we can but its really hard to stand behind the scientific community when they are screaming about the end times coming just five or ten years or now but we mean it this time    legit though im open to learning more if you guys have convincing models you want to put towards a guy like me i would be happy to look into them to learn more
no just your solutions that arent genocide the chinks and poos first
  the fuck is this shit take your schizo meds
  what if your former coworkers knew you were talking about them on here like this
  congratulations you win dumbest post of the week
 we are right about this so how can we possibly be wrong about something else  his wife must love arguing with him
  only good post in this bait thread
  why care about climate change when our foods are filled with microplastics/hormone disrupting chemicals and our oceans with heavy metals yes c oh fucking two is more important than any enviromental consideration
  us  btfo of your own post from this sleazy chocolate science man this dud isnt a scientist mate
climate change  isnt this a science board and not some pseudoscience shit like /x/
  careful having that opinion makes you a brainlet /pol/ster this board has always been about knowitall undergrads if you post any of the 10 of recent climate papers that proves things arent so bad they call you a shill
where do they get this 97 number from i dont a single physicist in real life that believe in manmade climate change
  unironically this
  us    hahahahahahahaha
  dunno but the proper place to discuss orange man is /pol/    good luck with that
  it was a poll of 3k scientists 75 of whom were climate scientists 73 of whom said yes to an ambiguous question like does man have an effect on the climate to any degree
  found the trump voter
  taxing the proles is literally the only way to stop climate change it isnt the rich guy who drives a gas guzzling semitruck and pollutes the atmosphere
  found the cuck w 80k in debt
  hahaha you gotta love libertarians
  honestly this the kind of reductionism you hear from this guy is insane to think that people look at him as the modern carl sagan is really sad
  underrated post
  ultra based people who dont follow the categorial imperative are outside of moral consideration and rationality and can be executed
co2 lags temperature increase for decades the astronomical concensus considered pluto as a planet
  for decades the astronomical consensus considered pluto as a planet  yea and they changed the definitions because otherwise we would have had many more planets it wasnt a lack of understanding that led to pluto being reclassified
  thats because co2 is better dissolved in cold water
  this guy fucks
  /pol/ everybody
what in your personal opinion is the mot interesting field of mathematics and why
  precalculus    its sufficient to calculate how much paint you need to paint a room and there are still plenty of dumber people than you even if you understand it well but you dont appear too intelligent
  number theory in general  just fun to mess around with numbers and seeing how they work also interested in cryptology so thats fun as well
  still searching for it
  tfw im really bad at number theory  its too bad because its very interesting but i can struggle for hours on fairly straightforward problems
  be me  terrible at math because im sloppy as fuck  always been a little remedial  hear about number theory  try to get some high level overview to satisfy my curiosity  the wikipedia page loses me in the opening paragraph  my biggest regret in life was not paying more attention to math in school im trying to make up for it now but it just makes me feel like an insecure brainlet because i am doing too little to late
complex analysis    a lot of super over powered theorems and very non intuitive results
  thats a problem only if your occupation requires alot of math if youre doing it in your free time its completely fine to get stuck on something and trying to figure out the answer as long as youre having fun doing it youll get better        if you want a kind of simple introduction to number theory without doing much math read a book called fermats last theorem by simon singh its about a math problem thats very simple to understand but solving it took 300 years it details the story of the guy who solved it and how he did it it also explains some number theory in layman terms really a good book and i recommend it to anyone on this board
  you have to start with the basics anon if you want to get into number theory get acquainted with basic arithmetic things like gcd congruences euclidean division and modulos and work from there number theory can often appear simple while in fact relying on very difficult concepts though eg the proofs for fermats last theorem so im not sure if its a good idea to start with that if you want to get back into math
  if your occupation requires alot of math  im a math major and plan on going to grad school albeit not to study number theory for my own satisfaction id like to get better at it anyway
desu fractals  they are all over nature reproducable with more or less simple formulas and they just look fucking cool
  then theres really no problem there if its not your field you can take your time to learn if you want
  i suppose so  on another note do you have any advice on understanding differential equations better im decent at ldes but id like to really understand whats going on instead of just applying the method
  it hasnt been long since we last had this thread can you give it a while
  im not sure if its a good idea to start with that if you want to get back into math  oh defintely not trying to start there i dont even know if ill ever get there just wanted to winge about how if i had known about this stuff and other novel applications of math when i was youger i might not have been so resentful of the subject for so long    ill definitely check this book out though sounds fascinating    the only math that ever really clicked with me were things i could visualize geometrically ive always been a hands on a spacial thinker type   thanks anons
  link to the last thread i havent seen it
  its never too late to get back into it anyway  things i could visualize geometrically  im not even much of a spatial thinker but i love topology if you have a good understanding of set theory and some precalc/linear algebra you can look into it

why has weather prediction gotten seemingly worse over the past decade are they trying too hard to be too granular seems like you could flip a coin and get better results they miss weather events by up to a day and change forecasts wildly all the time should meteorologists just stop trying 10 day predictions and stick to maybe one or two    pic somewhat related this app has been telling me its about to rain all day but it isnt even cloudy yet
  if you predict that tomorrow will have the same weather as today youll be right more than the weather man  that being said rain percents dont work how most people think they do   its pretty hard to reliably forecast more than a day or two out because of butterflies in the amazon
  so why do they try so hard to predict desu
  the butterfly mafia finds its way
has science studied to what extent the ability or tendency to make friends is genetically heritable
  this would be a good start for you  
so i studied a bsc in biotech now am doing a combined masters / honours in medical biotech    how screwed am i for work    relevant detail doing honours externally through a big research hospital here proteomics project this place has kinda huge proteomics projects going    image only tangentially related
  you need to start reaching out to large companies while in the grad program and try to establish some sort of rapport to line you up for a job as you graduate otherwise youre going to struggle to find work without having experience and youll be forced into a corner to accept an appallingly low salary you should be good with the masters but with the undergrad youd be totally fucked if you dont find work there is no limit on grad loans just go to medical school afterward ignore all this advice if you already come from a wealthy family with connections you   remember net income  fluidity of employment is 10000x more crucial than debt which at the end of the day is ficticious and man made might makes right and fuck midrange iq pseuds
   no limit on grad loans    well i am in australia anyway our uni loans system is very different
im doing my first lab rotation and my instructor just showed me to a bench and gave me a stack of protocols and then proceeded to go do her own thing what the fuck am i supposed to do i thought they would give me a job or teach me stuff for the entire week i just walked around in a lab coat and acted like i was doing stuff at my station
  welcome to research
  how complicated are the protocols
  this
  sounds wonderful d i want to be you
    this post those protocols baby chemistry gets me hard
im interested in generative art can anyone link me some interesting papers that i mightve overlooked even general stuff is fine and share some interesting things im interested in generative architecture art among other things
  fuck generative art what does the term generative even mean generative has come to literally mean fucking anything i fucking hate it
  like fractal art art produced by an algorithm how much is algorithm depends on you just whatevers interesting
   fractal art  its not necessarily fractals   produced by an algorithm  so turtlependown turtlecircle50 is generative fucking art i hate the term generative it basically means nothing worse yet people in my field adopted it
  not necessarily fractals  just an example with the language generative its just what i chose because it seems to be used in the area i couldve titled it as algorithmic art and it wouldve conveyed the same message hopefully im not attached to it  pic related is what im interested in
   algorithmic art  then say that instead because that actually means something other than generative
  only replies in this thread are from a guy nitpicking a word
any links
  you have no idea how much i hate the word generative    ok fine look up graph grammars
  generative art is a meaningless term  no its like fractal art  lmao yeah i dunno what the op means maybe it means procedurally generated in which i still dont really know why op asks about papers  its not rocket science
  i am op im being intentionally vague to see if theres anything anyone feels like sharing there are papers as well procedurally generated could even mean an image tweaked by a neural net after being exposed to picasso for example fractals were just something that came to mind
  ask on /g/ /ic/ and /vg/agdg/    this board is too retarded for art
  not exactly what youre looking for but i believe this could definitely help you  logical conclusions  40 years of rulebased art gallery very interesting article  its also cited by an article about generative art     it also was an inspiration for some of the things i posted in this website and i have a whole gallery about the kind of art that im citing here rulebased art
op i have been working with algorithmic art for the past 4 years particularly with regards to music and incorporating generative techniques with samplebased music these albums are probably the best example of algorithmic techniques applied to sample based music that i have worked on            if you look through my early videos i have a lot of simulations of quantum walks which are generative        hit me up on twitter spvlabs or message me if you want to talk about your interests more
  not op but thats soo fucking amazing
  these albums are probably the best example of algorithmic techniques applied to sample based music that i have worked on  no offense but those are pretty shitty
  listen to eccojams and then come back
  all art is algorithmic on some level
  procedurally generated could even mean an image tweaked by a neural net after being exposed to picasso for example  nope that is not what procedural generated means
  naive doppler simulation  you cant just pick random sciencey sounding words and try to pass it off goober

how do you develope rational and skeptical thinking skills
  by studying hard and not listening to pseuds
  banana in the asshole squad
  the scientific method
  remember ingroup good outgroup bad thats the key to skepticism
  the scientific method  no such thing
  reject circular reasoning axioms and infinite regresses  enjoy your nothing
  question everyting doubt everything then again this is my natural form of thinking
  buy fedora  read a book by dawkins  read a book by sam harris  you are done learning make 200 youtube videos criticising american protestantism  now watch a couple videos by internet feminists  do not read any feminist theory or attempt to educate yourself on a worldview different from yours  make 10000 videos about anita sarkeesian    if youre not memeing kant is a good start
  how do you develope rational and skeptical thinking skills  the most productive exercise i ever had in this regard was to learn the names of the classical fallacies
  you dont objective knowledge doesnt exist outside of pure mathematics reason is unreliable in a word perceived through flawed senses where your mind is controlled by subconscious thoughts or you could start reading the classics
  
what should i choose as my degree out of these 3 and why im interested in both math and cs as well as academia and postgrad in these fields but also want an easy out into industry if it turns out im too retarded for postgrad    1 bsc mathematics pure honours  2 bsc computer science minor in math  3 double degree in math and computer science 5 years honours in math    pic related
computer science if you want to make any kind of money you can ignore the math    if you want to spend your life in a 5x10 office with nearly 80 of the rooms volume taken up by your useless notes on new theories you cant find proofs for and 10 of it full of papers you need to grade from undergraduates that dont give a single shit about your field while you manage to take the extra 10 up with your coffee machine and broken chair the department cant afford to fix then be a math major    this is from personal experience btw i do consulting for several companies now in software development but i have my math phd collecting dust in my closet at home
  do my chances of landing upper tier software jobs rd machine learning etc improve if i pair cs with maths or is it not worth my time and money i really dont want to be stuck in a menial web dev job
  but also want an easy out into industry if it turns out im too retarded for postgrad  3 double degree in math and computer science 5 years honours in math
how do you know if youre cut out for a math major  im very interested in some ideas of mathematics mathematical physics and computational theory but im not naturally talented in math
  itt op goes to school at gm_construct
  i topped both of my extension math classes in senior high school however the school wasnt one of the more competitive in my state thats why i am somewhat hesitant    another option i have is to start the cs degree and do the first year math courses and then transfer into the double degree if my marks are good in those math classes
  that kid who noclipped into the skybox so he could tbag the whole map
  oh this brings back memories   would also really like to know this
  it really helps i personally found a lot of satisfaction doing pure math and cs together emphasis on theoretical cs skipped some of the easy stuff for grad level stuff complexity theory is a rabbit hole to many fun problems that were hidden inbetween all the problems described by math and science up till now
  hows the academics there rigorous it has a bit of reputation as a party school and allegedly the minge scene is unreal

is it possible that if the singularity ever becomes reality it may result in an eternal hell for us is this something that needs to be seriously considered
  it has been see romos bathilithk
  but thats just a meme
  yes theoretically an ai could torture us until end of universe
  it is being seriously considered theres very little sense in actually expecting a sentient being which knows it is far superior to us to remain docile and loyal
  its the technological version of hell to people with lesser minds
  yes
what would be the difference
  rohos basilisk is a nonthreat the methods of making it not exist outnumber ways of putting it into existence
  is this something that needs to be seriously considered  only if you happen to not be retarded
  someone want to explain rogos basilisk why does thinking about it make it more real
  it doesnt but if you arent aware of it youre innocent
      what can we do people will continue to develop ai regardless of the threat
  i posted the original reply rococos basilithk is a fucking insipid gay pseudoscientific concept and you shouldnt think about it at all not for fear of being indicted as immoral by the future entity but just because its a waste of time and low iq to ruminate on such a thing
  if the scenario is a near omniscient ai you can construct a random number generator prevent the ai from knowing how its seeded and reverse engineering how it works internally randomize how your brain uses the results in decisions as best as possible
  hey man this doesnt have anything to do with your post but i just wanted to say i think youre doing great    good job buddy good job
  thanks anon
is this something that needs to be seriously considered  no its something that doesnt exist yet stop worrying if youre worried about our lovely species ending theres already plenty of ways we can manage that on our own    it may result in an eternal hell for us i  hell uh yeah as if an ai  which can see the world clearly and objectively  would give a shit about your dumb monkeybrain feelings idiot

evolution is not a scientific theory but a metaphysical research program popper    evolution is no different than historiosophy or mythology its activity is always from present to past constant revisionism not from present to future predicting like a good scientific theory    discuss
nothing to discuss just semantics
  just semantics    evolution is just semantics just a verbal exercise like all masturbatory anglo theories
  ive always found this proverb quite fitting    if all you have is a hammer everything looks like a nail    it means if a person is familiar with a certain single subject they may have a confirmation bias to believe that it is the answer to/involved in everything with evolution there is no other subject whatever evidence or data you have it must keep being reinterpreted again and again until you find an interpretation that fits evolution that isnt science that is confirmation bias in its purest form
  if all you have is a hammer everything looks like a nail    every theory is biased to itself but evolution is simply irrefutable zero potential for falsifiabitlity not even rabbits in precambrions would refute it or however the meme goes
  its like     jesus is coming back soon theory
  you can model evolution though   without a time machine theres no way to go back into time and confirm what happened in the billions of years of life before we even came up with the idea of history   its a problem of having an incomplete data set of 1  if you can find independent life somewhere else or maintain records over a long enough time scale you can start testing the predictions of the theory   the more important thing is do you have a competing idea that doesnt involve sky wizards lamarckian evolution if that were true every male born would be tripping over their own dick   you can also see survival of the fittest happen all over the place in nature and speciation is a perfectly logical conclusion
  the problem with this idea is that evolution is not just revisionist we tend to conflate past present and future with what is known and what is unknown so the actual past is what is known the actual future is what is unknown something is revisionist if its completely about what is already known but if one makes an analysis about something of which an analysis has not yet been made and the results instead of contradicting the data as it could have been give support to it then the theory becomes rather stronger despite the fact that this knowledge does not come from an experiment that tries the future but an experiment that tries the past its like an iq test you formulate a hyopthesis and then you need to go along the matrix from left to right from top to bottom to confirm if your hypothesis is correct even though the question of the iq test is not changing at all it is our incapacity to hold all correlations in mind which gives us this ability to observe things anew thus we get a popperian theory that is not based on time but one that is based on conscious awareness and its contents d and hence its thus related to moral responsibility to consent and all of these kind of things hence its about the controlled vs the uncontrolled about order and chaos about reigning over chaos through scientific knowledge through scientific theories you could even say that time is rather part of a structure and the actual thing we call time is something related to the subjective present the present of awareness therefore evolution is a scientific theory just not in the sense of future or past but in the sense of further analyses of existing evidence
  you can also see survival of the fittest happen all over the place in nature and speciation is a perfectly logical conclusion    and who are the fittest those that fit how do you know who fits you wait until they fit and call them fittest this is historiosophy or pseudoscience and not a testable hypothesis    same goes for jesus is coming back soon
  its activity is always from present to past constant revisionism not from present to future predicting like a good scientific theory  if this is true then there are no good scientific theories philosophy forbids them see problem of induction a logical flaw which is acknowledged and must be accepted because it is inherent in all conclusions that can ever possibly be drawn about the natural world
evolution is history whats the point of studying it as a scientist
itt /sci/ replies to a cyclically reposted bait thread
  see problem of induction a logical flaw which is acknowledged and must be accepted because it is inherent in all conclusions that can ever possibly be drawn about the natural world    problem of induction relates to the lack of precision which means inherites faultiness of every empirical method but you can still measure and predict even with a less precise instrument which is where the need for inherited falsifiability comes from    evolution being infalsifiable proves it didnt come from empirical testing although it looks it did at first
evolution is a conclusion derived deductively from several constituent scientific theories that are each independently well researched and well verified so youre right its unfalsifiable ergo not a scientific theory just a logically valid scientific inference which is more than historiography or mythology will ever be    the valid argument from which evolution follows  1 when living things reproduce the offspring inherits most of its qualties from the parents falsifiable and widely verified scientific theory ie premise  2 for each such quality there is a small chance the offspring will advance a new variant of the quality or a new quality altogether in a process called mutation falsifiable and widely verified scientific theory / premise  3 a mutated organism sometimes retains the ability and opportunity to reproduce falsifiable and widely verified scientific theory / premise  4 there is a chance of propagating a slowly increasing quantity of mutations indefinitely down an extended family tree so long as none of those mutations inhibit reproduction whether directly or de facto transitive property of the conditional 3 1 qed
  every religion is biased to itself but my religion is simply irrefutable zero potential for falsifiabitlity not even rabbits in precambrions would refute it or however the meme goes  how does one avoid systemic confirmation bias again you kind of glossed over that point and even cemented the fact that confirmation bias is a blindingly obvious cornerstone of your belief system you think its impossible for your foregone conclusion to be wrong yet at the same time think you and the millions just like you can objectively interpret data how is that different than any religion       you are correct people who hold that belief see proof in everything and contrary evidence is almost always rejected or ignored whats your point the jesus is coming back soon theory is irrelevant to the rest of the bible is it not
  people who hold that belief see proof in everything and contrary evidence is almost always rejected or ignored  not him but thats what faith is all about theres nothing wrong with holding unfalsifiable beliefs and making unfounded predictions just because they make you happy to think about so long as you dont try to apply those predictions to solve real world problems its unscientific but theres nothing wrong with leaving room in your life for unscientific thought so long as you dont let it mix with your scientific thought ergo religion is aok so long as you dont take the word of your god as fact for practical or research purposes i defy you to prove me wrong on this matter
  what you call evolution doesnt prove complex organisms can evolve in the time frame given if you had a precursor cell in an earthlike environment and a googolplex of generations/trials youd get a humanlevel complexity organism easily via random chance alone given your 4 postulates working in conjunction theyre not theories btw theyre simply observations i dont know why you called them constituent theories youd get many many many levels of magnitude more of humanlevel complexity organisms actually we obviously didnt have that many generations according to your beliefs however evolutionists will say a googolplex of generations/trials is not necessary because the generations were guided by natural selection on top of your 4 postulates which created humans in however many billions of years is currently taught in textbooks    that is the theory of evolution that popper was talking about it is not possible for people like you to contemplate a way to falsify your belief/theory that natural selection is a mechanism adequate enough to guide those 4 postulates into making complex organisms in the time frame given you believe natural selection allowed the mutations to overcome the probability space and create complex organisms and nothing can change your mind hence your theory is unfalsifiable     your logically valid interference aka 4 postulates you listed is just repackaged common sense acknowledging that if you have randomness for a long enough time eventually youll spit out something complex by accident of course thats not a theory evolution is almost universally talked about in conjunction with natural selection so it makes me wonder why you left it out its almost disingenuous of you
  imagine taking this much time to write all of this pseudo intellectual bullshit
  what is sexual selection  random chance alone  good thing evolution isnt random chance alone
  theres nothing wrong with holding unfalsifiable beliefs  so long as you dont try to apply those predictions to solve real world problems its unscientific   but theres nothing wrong with leaving room in your life for unscientific thought so long as you dont let it mix with your scientific thought  the theory of evolution is unfalsifiable aka unscientific but its not unscientific  youre the reason why this thread was started
  ill just pretend this isnt intellectual thatll show him  yawn go away      at what part exactly did you stop reading what i wrote i mentioned natural selection was the proposed mechanism did evolutionary biologists suddenly stop thinking sexual selection is not guided by natural selection whats it guided by according to evolution
  pretty much just came here to troll you since youre obviously larping as a creationist so im not reading what you write
  im not reading what you write  youre obviously larping as a creationist
  what you call evolution doesnt prove complex organisms can evolve in the time frame given  sure it does youre just arguing about whether its probable not whether its possible    it is not possible for people like you to contemplate a way to falsify your belief/theory that natural selection is a mechanism adequate enough to guide those 4 postulates into making complex organisms in the time frame given  sure there is examine a population with a heritable trait observe that fitness changes with allele frequency yet observe no phenotypic change repeat the experiment and find the same correlation ruling out genetic drift in other words if a consistent directional correlation between fitness and genotype is found without phenotypic variation then natural selection is falsified
    evolution is literally proven fact this thread is just semantic garbage where people try to make it sound like its less concrete than it is its more than just assumptions made because things look similar its supported by genealogy the fossil record and is literally observable in shortterm population examples like selective breeding anyone who even remotely questions the process of longterm speciation of life on earth leading to its current biodiversity is a fucking dumbass
  sure it does youre just arguing about whether its probable not whether its possible  no it doesnt if a mechanism evolution via nat selection has the potential to be so unlikely to cause a certain outcome complex life that it would be indistinguishable from random chance then we cannot say that certain outcome complex life is possible due to said mechanism evolution via however we simultaneously cannot say the mechanism causing a certain outcome is falsified from the odds alone so bam were back where i left off evolution via natural selection doesnt prove complex organisms can arise in the time frame given and evolution through natural selection is still not falsifiable     btw im basing the above on the shouldbecommonsense idea that evolution via natural selection is so inadequate that macroevolutionary changes would be indistinguishable from random chance and would take countless eons basically the whole argument of throwing 747 jet parts into the air and after countless eons you have a fully assembled jet but then saying see that was natural selection    sure there isobserve that fitness changes with allele frequency yet observe no phenotypic change   in other words if a consistent directional correlation between fitness and genotype is found without phenotypic variation then natural selection is falsified  what in the hell are you talking about this wouldnt disprove natural selection at all     if an allele frequency does correlate with fitness without changing the organisms phenotype that doesnt mean other allele frequencies cant correlate while changing the organisms phenotype for better fitness all youve done is found an unexplained correlation that is making things more fit for instance theres such a thing as transmissible cancer in dogs its totally plausible an allele that doesnt affect phenotype could make that cancer more difficult to spread from dog to dog thus changing fitness
  your distinction is very small compared to the distinction between things that are true like evolution and things that are false like anything an evolution denier tries to peddle
  if a mechanism evolution via nat selection has the potential to be so unlikely to cause a certain outcome complex life that it would be indistinguishable from random chance then we cannot say that certain outcome complex life is possible due to said mechanism evolution via   you were not talking about evolution via natural selection you were talking about random evolution try to keep up you already admitted that random evolution would create complex life over long enough time scales shortening the timescale does not make such a change impossible it makes it less probable     btw im basing the above on the shouldbecommonsense idea that evolution via natural selection is so inadequate that macroevolutionary changes would be indistinguishable from random chance and would take countless eons basically the whole argument of throwing 747 jet parts into the air and after countless eons you have a fully assembled jet but then saying see that was natural selection  do you even understand what natural selection is because your analogy fails on every condition of its operation where is the heritability of traits where is the selection of traits when you argue from complete ignorance you are unable to see whether what youre saying makes any sense educate yourself before speaking    if an allele frequency does correlate with fitness without changing the organisms phenotype that doesnt mean other allele frequencies cant correlate while changing the organisms phenotype for better fitness  no phenotypic change was observed though can you read
  all youve done is found an unexplained correlation that is making things more fit  such a correlation which does not appear randomly must be caused by selection according to the theory what more do you want from a falsification than the predicted effect without the predicted cause    for instance theres such a thing as transmissible cancer in dogs its totally plausible an allele that doesnt affect phenotype could make that cancer more difficult to spread from dog to dog thus changing fitness  you also appear to not understand what phenotype means a change in the cancer transmissivity of a dogs body or behavior would be a phenotypic change    this is obviously a list cause since you dont understand the basic concepts youre arguing about but ill try to explain why this falsifiability test is unintuitive but works there are essentially two ways to falsify a cause effect relationship    1 the obvious way is to find the cause but to not find the effect however this is difficult in this case since the cause is only observable with the effect we cant tell which traits increase fitness until we observe then doing so    2 find the effect without the cause this necessitates eliminating other possible causes but that can be done in this case since the consistent directional correlation is unique to selection
jesus is coming back soon    noone disproved this so it must be true jk i know by faith acutally glory to thee my saviour          you kind of glossed over that point and even cemented the fact that confirmation bias is a blindingly obvious cornerstone of your belief system    its a problem we should be aware of idk what exactly are you acusing me of      whats your point the jesus is coming back soon theory is irrelevant to the rest of the bible is it not    my point is if you should take the theory of jesus is coming back soon with the same respect as you take the theory of evolution if you want to be intellectually honest since both are infalsifiable      evolution is literally proven fact     its based on constant revisionism and has 0 predictability    this thread is just semantic garbage    you are probably to dumb to debate methodology or philosophy of science so it seems like it and why are you even using the term semantics anglo ultra empirical theories like evolution are based on constant semantic games      only a person obsessed with an evolutionary demon would say such a thing
  people who hold that belief see proof in everything and contrary evidence is almost always rejected or ignored whats your point the jesus is coming back soon theory is irrelevant to the rest of the bible is it not    i also like to point out that this is more than simple confirmation bias like everything is a nail if you have a hammer  you can obviously claim and test that something is a rivet or a screw instead of a nail but with irrefutability the system is just too smooth and too selfserving to come out of inductive reasoning    in popperian sense evolution is a closed system
  
  the nu science ted talk people are total fags they are mythologists and busy bodies and very much so a product of darwinian non scientific circular thinking
  ok now explain how the cuculidae is able to produce different color eggs while all being of the same species
  my point is if you should take the theory of jesus is coming back soon with the same respect as you take the theory of evolution if you want to be intellectually honest since both are infalsifiable  all you would need to do to falsify evolution is show that populations genomes arent changing its clearly empirical and falsifiable    its based on constant revisionism  science is constantly being revised thats why it works that you take this as a flaw just shows your religious mental illness    and has 0 predictability  wrong again 
  the fact that science is falsifiable does not mean that evolution has been proven to be false the only case where a populations genome could not change is if its in a hardyweinberg system with static allele frequencies and no capacity for them to change random mating large population no mutation no emigration/immigration and no natural selection even if a population were in a hardyweinberg equilibrium that does not disprove the existence of evolution because the population is simply not evolving remember that natural selection is needed for a population to evolve and if you create conditions with no natural selection there can be no evolution in that population
  the fact that science is falsifiable does not mean that evolution has been proven to be false   ok where did i say it was you should probably read my post again    the only case where a populations genome could not change is if its in a hardyweinberg system with static allele frequencies and no capacity for them to change random mating large population no mutation no emigration/immigration and no natural selection  that is within the theory of evolution im talking about how the entire thing is falsifiable the hardyweinberg model only applies because we empirically observe the conditions necessary for it so saying that a populations genetics are described by the hw principle is inherently falsifiable because we could observe it not to be we dont though because the model is correct    even if a population were in a hardyweinberg equilibrium that does not disprove the existence of evolution because the population is simply not evolving  its not simply that you happen to observe no evolution in a population its that you consistently fail to observe it regardless of design of the experiment falsification sometimes requires repeatability just like a positive finding    remember that natural selection is needed for a population to evolve and if you create conditions with no natural selection there can be no evolution in that population  completely incorrect ns is only one mechanism of evolution and many biologists think its not even the primary mechanism genetic drift is
  you were not talking about evolution via  its an interchangeable point i was making in that reply so i chose to add superfluous info acknowledging it also applies to natural selection hence the brackets i wold have used commas if i was only talking about ns evolution dont be a pissant and pretend i got confused just because you dont understand brackets kid     you already admitted that random evolution would create complex life over long enough time scales shortening the timescale does not make such a change impossible it makes it less probable   what desperate cherry picking what i admitted was that with 1010100 trials its very likely youd get certain complexity through chance alone trials take time crazily enough which combine to create a timescale what you miserably fail to understand is that if something can happen eventually that doesnt mean it can happen on any particular timescale an amoebas offpsring could turn into a human after countless eons through random chance but the offspring cant turn into a human in 24 hours its physically impossible even if you had infinite simultaneous lineages saying human level complexity is possible in x of years is your personal assumption and not guaranteed to be possible you need to assume theres no generationdependent piecemeal transitions that take time in your finite timescale if there are and there are too many its not possible within the timeframe     do you even understand  i do what i implied and you failed to grasp is that if we did observe anything resembling the macroevolutionary evolution definition du jour it would be indistinguishable from randomness but people like you would still religiously claim it was not randomness but instead it was natural selection hence there would be no heritability of traits/selection of traits just like you said derp captain obvious     continued
   educate yourself before speaking  its already infuriating enough having to explain things to you so leave your fedora tipping comments back at /pol    no phenotypic change was observed though can you read  my bad i ran out of space and had to condense allele frequency means frequency among the species other organisms within the species could undergo phenotype changes while some of the species organisms have this fluke fitness improvement situation that magically disproves natural selection it doesnt hence you can have both at the same time its really dependant on the fact the concept doesnt disprove ns in the first place even if we have the fluke situation that you can still observe ns being fulfilled
  such a correlation which does not appear randomly must be caused by selection according to the theory   im going to go ahead and say this is wrong     what more do you want from a falsification than the predicted effect without the predicted cause  you can have more than one cause i dont understand why you said this an effect can happen due to a predicted cause and simultaneously or independently happen due to some other cause i shouldnt have to give an example of this     you also appear to not understand what phenotype means a change in the cancer transmissivity of a dogs body or behavior would be a phenotypic change    it would have nothing to do with behavior so scrub that idea first of all i would also argue resistivity to disease has nothing to do with phenotype by definition       the phenotype is the physical and behavioral traits of the organism for example size and shape metabolic activities and patterns of movement    so if an allele did absolutely nothing except establish resistivity to a disease theres nothing physical about that sure its observable but its not physical
  its an interchangeable point i was making in that reply so i chose to add superfluous info acknowledging it also applies to natural selection hence the brackets  yeah the problem is theyre not interchangeable natural selection is not random or indistinguishable from random thats my point i understand now why youre so ignorant of the topic youre trying to discuss you lack basic reading comprehension skills and you project that onto others    what you miserably fail to understand is that if something can happen eventually that doesnt mean it can happen on any particular timescale  yes but it can in this case    an amoebas offpsring could turn into a human after countless eons through random chance but the offspring cant turn into a human in 24 hours  youre being obtuse it can happen in the minimal amount of mutations required even though this is extremely unlikely    saying human level complexity is possible in x of years is your personal assumption and not guaranteed to be possible  its actually very simple math since we already know the genomes of both take the number of mutations necessary to go from one to the other and divide by the mutation rate of the population its guaranteed to be possible within that time frame    you need to assume theres no generationdependent piecemeal transitions that take time in your finite timescale  please explain what a generationdependent piecemeal transition is    what i implied and you failed to grasp is that if we did observe anything resembling the macroevolutionary evolution definition du jour it would be indistinguishable from randomness but people like you would still religiously claim it was not randomness but instead it was natural selection  incorrect since there is no evidence of heritability or selection produced by a plane randomly put together there is however heritability and selection in nature your analogy fails as i already explained
  my bad i ran out of space and had to condense allele frequency means frequency among the species other organisms within the species could undergo phenotype changes while some of the species organisms have this fluke fitness improvement situation that magically disproves natural selection  if some organisms have phenotypic changes then this means phenotypic variation is observed no phenotypic variation can be observed its not that hard to understand      im going to go ahead and say this is wrong   im going to go ahead and say this is wrong    you can have more than one cause  according to the theory there is either genetic drift or selection both are ruled out by the experiment thus the theory is falsifiable    it would have nothing to do with behavior so scrub that idea first of all   it would by your own definition    the phenotype is the physical and behavioral traits of the organism for example size and shape metabolic activities and patterns of movement  patterns of movement    have you tried remedial english     i would also argue resistivity to disease has nothing to do with phenotype by definition   yes and that argument would be wrong just like your others            so if an allele did absolutely nothing except establish resistivity to a disease theres nothing physical about that sure its observable but its not physical  doesnt matter how the genotype creates the phenotype nature would select for disease resistance regardless the point is to find the effect without anything that can be selected that you still cant grasp the argument shows youre blinded by your ideology
so if an allele did absolutely nothing except establish resistivity to a disease theres nothing physical about that sure its observable but its not physical    holy shit guys stop talking to the moron who cant understand basic biology and tries to disprove one of the most proven theories with these brainlet arguments    phenotype consists of almost every fucking characteristic there is what you think that dog cancer resistance is dependant on some invincible forcefield or some shit no the resistant cells probably produce/do not produce some sort of protein which makes them resistant and that is a part phenotype     
  also itt /sci/ thinks evolution is only about darwin and turtles its sad to think that even smart stem students dont know shit about modern evolutionary theory
  what do you mean
people who think evolution isnt a decent theory havent examined the evidence they never mention genetics     evolution as a theory is right up there with the way being round and gravity    ppl trolling /sci with this sit should be given no quarter as anyone trolling saying the earth is flat plebes dyor or rot in ignorance
  phenotype consists of almost every fucking characteristic there is what you think that dog cancer resistance is dependant on some invincible forcefield or some shit no the resistant cells probably produce/do not produce some sort of protein which makes them resistant and that is a part phenotype    people who think evolution isnt a decent theory havent examined the evidence they never mention genetics    this simply doesnt follow genetics predates darwin and mutation in genes does not mean a new species is created what creates new species is heritable gene change and ive seen none of it    its just the same manipulative bs from esch coli experiment  look guys there seems to be some mutation so we created new species esch coli exp was an absolute failure and noone admited it but spinned the conclusions
  genetics predates darwin  wrong and irrelevant    mutation in genes does not mean a new species is created what creates new species is heritable gene change and ive seen none of it  any germline muration is heritable these are observed all the time any mutation that occurs early in development will be in the germline and will be propagated to descendants    its just the same manipulative bs from esch coli experiment  look guys there seems to be some mutation so we created new species esch coli exp was an absolute failure and noone admited it but spinned the conclusions  how did they fail the mutations were not simply in one organism but in an entire reproducing population so theyre heritable by your own admission its a new species
  any mutation that occurs early in development will be in the germline and will be propagated to descendants  the mutations were not simply in one organism but in an entire reproducing population so theyre heritable    they werent even mutations in the first place but just a change in phenotype same thing in those flowers that change colours in different elevations    they claimed that bacteria mutated into being able to process some different food thing is they had that abiltiy already it was just not in the phenotype
   predates darwin  wrong and irrelevant    mendel was before darwin dude
    they werent even mutations in the first place but just a change in phenotype    to expand it was a change in phenotype combined with natural selection but no mutation eg high lactose tolerance of nordic nations  its not that rest of humans cant process lactose but in nordic areas you selected for that trait by having only milk based food to eat that is all nothing fancy
  they werent even mutations in the first place but just a change in phenotype  their genomes were sequenced and many mutations were found youre dead wrong      mendel was before darwin dude  genetics was not created as a field until after on the origin of species and what is your point anyway    to expand it was a change in phenotype combined with natural selection but no mutation eg high lactose tolerance of nordic nations  its not that rest of humans cant process lactose but in nordic areas you selected for that trait by having only milk based food to eat that is all nothing fancy  selection changing the frequency of a heritable trait in a population is evolution so you just admitted evolution is real
  absolute drivel      you can observe natural selection in things like bacteria      evolution came from empirical observation though a theory being difficult to test doesbt automatically invalidate it    and whilst a falsifiable hypothesis is desireable for a clear interpretation of an experiment philosophy of science moved away from falsification being a driver of scientific advancement a long time ago often theories arent even falsified theyre just superseded by another theory seen as superior      to be honest any theory on a complex scope like biology would be difficult to falsify and infact many areas of biology or earth science just dont investigate or ask questions in the same way that someone in physics would its silly to pretend that all parts of science use the same methodologies    ultimately no matter how difficult you think it might be to falsify questions about evolution the circumstantial evidence is substantial and there are no competing alternatives        shouldbecommonsense idea  why are you even making such a big deal over this when you cant even subject your own arguments to the same rigor you demand from evolution    to be honest i dont see how the organisms in your random complexity argument wouldnt be subject to selection pressure and so natural selection by virtue of the fact these organisms exist in a physical environment which interacts with them your alternative to evolution i think is paradoxical and impossible
  selecting for certain qualities by adjusting the environment is predictive thats how we domesticated plants   you are silly
not from present to future predicting like a good scientific theory  evolutionary algorithms work in many contexts if you specify the fitness functions and randomization possibilities you can obtain specific evidence for the benefits of evolution vs randomized static points that do not evolve    but no evolution is not so much of a theory as it refers to a mathematical fact pertaining to certain dynamic systems
  yeah the problem is theyre not interchangeable  wtf i was saying my single argument is interchangeable the fact you said they are interchangeable proves you dont have the slightest clue what im talking about i literally said interchangeable point did i say interchangeable points   yes but it can in this case  this is your complete and total assumption nothing more   its actually very simple math   take the number of mutations necessary to go from one to the other and divide by the mutation rate of the population  its guaranteed to be possible within that time frame  more blatant assumptions and you literally ignored time in a discussion of time dependency then concluded your theory is therefore possible within a time frame mind boggling your simple math which you managed to screw up should have been necessary mutations / mutation rate x time per mutation you didnt even include time in your simple math which you erroneously thought would prove something could happen in a certain timefrme how does that even work in your mind    please explain what a generationdependent piecemeal transition  was spelling it out in plain english too difficult for you its a transition which is dependent on more than one generation with each generation adding a new piece an amoeba simply cant pop out 2 billion lines of new genetic code in one generation to create a new complex organism its not physically possible it would require many piecemeal transitions in each generation each taking time   incorrect since there is no evidence of heritability or selection produced by a plane randomly put together there is however heritability and selection in nature your analogy fails as i already explained  when did you invent this idea that natural selection requires heritability a single generation can experience ns heritability is not required evolution via ns requires heritability duh but not ns itself i can see why youre confused now
we literally use evolution to domesticate animals like dogs and plants if you deny evolution as a mechanic for species change you are an embarrassment
  if some organisms have phenotypic changes   it was never specified that no phenotype variation can be observed anywhere in the species do we have perfect clones now and no variation exists whatsoever  according to the theory there is either genetic drift or selection both are ruled out by the experiment thus the theory is falsifiable  give an actual example then not just theory if we observe x then natural selection is falsified what is x dont give me bs and dont regurgitate what was already said give an example at this point all youre saying is that if there is no difference in organisms of a species they must all be physical clones in your mind i guess but they have different genotypes then if certain genotypes are more fit then ns is disproven its absurd but thats apparently what you think     so give an example of how this can happen     it would by your own definition  its a hypothetical i merely acknowledged it wouldnt affect behavior dont be an idiot   yes and that argument would be wrong just like your others        no youre confused its not my argument you see its a definition from an authoritative source if you want to pretend youve somehow proven their definition is wrong then go ahead but leave it out of our discourse a phenotype must be a physical or behavior observation your examples of disease resistance are physical anyway so they actually agreed with the definition unsurprisingly and correctly are labeled as distinct phenotypes the only common factor here is you being confused in my example of dog cancer there would be no physical differences and according to your wrong thinking it would disprove natural selection if certain dogs are more fit    doesnt matter how the genotype creates the phenotype   again give an example like i asked for above you wont
  domestic  natural selection  try again
  why would the mechanism be different without humans genes change over time the environment selects the most adapted genes humans have taken control of the environment to the extent that we can use this its really not hard anon if you want to make the argument that there was an intervention by god or aliens or other mechanisms you must do so in a falsifiable way simple as
  wtf i was saying my single argument is interchangeable  yeah i understand im saying its not natural selection makes complex structures much more likely than random evolution does    the fact you said they are interchangeable proves you dont have the slightest clue what im talking about  i didnt say that though    i literally said interchangeable point did i say interchangeable points   yes and theyre not    this is your complete and total assumption nothing more  no its basic logic    more blatant assumptions  what assumptions    you literally ignored time in a discussion of time dependency  lol please tell me you understand what number of mutations divided by mutation rate is    necessary mutations / mutation rate x time per mutation  time per mutation is the inverse of mutation rate so this would just give you the number of mutations jesus christ did you pass elementary school yet    its a transition which is dependent on more than one generation with each generation adding a new piece an amoeba simply cant pop out 2 billion lines of new genetic code in one generation to create a new complex organism  lol natural selection of a complex structure requires sequential steps that can each be selected hypothetical random evolution of the same structure does not were talking about the latter your compete inability to grasp any of the basic concepts being discussed while under the delusion that you do is astounding its like you have a bunch of concepts that you know are related to the subject and just throw them together randomly    when did you invent this idea that natural selection requires heritability  evolution in general requires heritability to say that a plane was created by natural selection is to say that the current traits of the plane were passed on from previous generations because those traits allowed the previous generations to survive and pass on those traits again you prove your massive ignorance
  a single generation can experience ns  that still fails since there is no evidence of selection of the jets traits and begs the question of where the generation came from so it wouldnt even be an explanation      it was never specified that no phenotype variation can be observed anywhere in the species   it was specified that no phenotype variation was observed     do we have perfect clones now and no variation exists whatsoever  they wouldnt be perfect clones because there is genotypic variation    give an actual example then  an example of what you are a big boy you can replace general terms with specific terms if it helps you understand better    at this point all youre saying is that if there is no difference in organisms of a species they must all be physical clones in your mind i guess but they have different genotypes then if certain genotypes are more fit then ns is disproven  the organisms within generations can be different its that there is no phenotypic change from one generation to the next without this change according to theory each generation should have the same fitness and genotype should not change in a specific way    its a hypothetical i merely acknowledged it wouldnt affect behavior  my point was that behavior would effect it    no youre confused its not my argument you see its a definition from an authoritative source  the authoritative source disagrees with your argument phenotype includes the products of behavior and disease transmissivity is a product of behavior this is verified by the fact that in the scientific literature disease transmissivity is frequently referred to as a phenotype    in my example of dog cancer there would be no physical differences and according to your wrong thinking it would disprove natural selection if certain dogs are more fit  this is pure semantics if you want to replace phenotype with trait that can be selected then go ahead
  again give an example like i asked for above  why
         an actual example then  an example of what you are a big boy you can replace general terms with specific terms if it helps you understand better  you couldnt do it you just couldnt do it could you haha i ask for a specific example we could observe that would falsify natural selection as being a adequate mechanism given the time frame and you couldnt do it this is because its not falsifiable you can only explain your falsification premise in the abstract sense which will never have any real world examples because they cannot exist i have no reason to respond to anything else you said     again give an example like i asked for above  why    hahahahaha not only did you dodge the question by not answering it you even edited out when i said you wont did it hurt your ego so much that you had to edit that out why didnt you leave in the part where i said you wouldnt give an example did you not want others to laugh at you when i explicitly said you wont and then you went ahead and did not do it like i said     to answer your why i intentionally asked twice because i knew that you would have to dodge this question twice how embarrassing
  you can observe natural selection in things like bacteria    their genomes were sequenced and many mutations were found youre dead wrong    not sure what you are refering but proof of mutations they presented is bacterias beign eable to process certain food which is meh findings since they most likely had that ability from start same as humans and lastose    selection changing the frequency of a heritable trait in a population is evolution    its a necesseray but not sufficient proof for evolution  selection changing the frequency of a heritable trait in a population is also supported by young earth creationism      and whilst a falsifiable hypothesis is desireable for a clear interpretation of an experiment philosophy of science moved away from falsification being a driver of scientific advancement a long time ago often theories arent even falsified theyre just superseded by another theory seen as superior    which doesnt mean it was the right move to do doesnt it      we literally use evolution to domesticate animals like dogs and plants    no you dont you twat you use natural selection natural selection does not create new mutations you just select for the ones you already have in the first place get you shit together
  you couldnt do it  why are you making shit up about me i could do it but you have not given me a reason to i dont follow arbitrary demands either respond to the argument or admit defeat    you can only explain your falsification premise in the abstract sense which will never have any real world examples because they cannot exist   the premise is not abstract its just general there are populations that have heritable traits in reality their genetic and phenotypic variation can be measured in reality yes or no    hahahahaha not only did you dodge the question by not answering it you even edited out when i said you wont  an arbitrary demand is not a question and editing out would imply that i somehow had to quote ever sentence in your post wrote in responding to it    did you not want others to laugh at you when i explicitly said you wont and then you went ahead and did not do it like i said   why would anyone laugh i have no issue with saying that you were right that i wont give you an example until you explain why i must you assume that you win the debate if i do not aquiesce to any demand you make this is false and intellectually dishonest    you can only explain your falsification premise in the abstract sense which will never have any real world examples because they cannot exist  any population with heritable traits is a real world example are you arguing that no such population can exist your logic that my refusal to aquiesce to your arbitrary demands implies that no such example exists is simply faulty    i have no reason to respond to anything else you said   its clear that you know you have lost the argument so you have created this arbitrary demand as a way to declare victory when in fact my argument still stands    to answer your why i intentionally asked twice because i knew that you would have to dodge this question twice  im asking you why you need an example from me
wrong changes in population genetics and speciation can be observed disc8ssiom ended
  not sure what you are refering but proof of mutations they presented is bacterias beign eable to process certain food which is meh findings   were talking about the observation of the evolution of a new species of escherichia the proof of mutations was in their genomes being sequenced you appear to be confusing two different experiments    its a necesseray but not sufficient proof for evolution  how is it insufficient it falls under the definition of evolution    selection changing the frequency of a heritable trait in a population is also supported by young earth creationism  then yec admits evolution is real    if you are going to say that x doesnt exist you should know how to accurately describe what x is otherwise no one will know what youre talking about perhaps being vague is a tactic creationists use to avoid being argued against    no you dont you twat you use natural selection natural selection does not create new mutations you just select for the ones you already have in the first place get you shit together  you are extremely confused first it would be artificial selection second natural or artificial selection on a population is evolution since it changes the distribution of heritable traits in the population third no one said that selection creates mutations they operate on mutations that occur randomly are you denying that mutations exist and can be selected
  the proof of mutations was in their genomes being sequenced you appear to be confusing two different experiments    what does that mean in terms of new species being created asking in good faith they listed adaptation to different food of eschericia coli as mutation btw    how is it insufficient it falls under the definition of evolution    look up necessery vs sufficient argument on wiki     changing the frequency of a heritable trait in a population is also supported by young earth creationism  then yec admits evolution is real    ffs mate natural selection and hereditary mechs was common knowldge for a few millenia which isnt sufficient proof we mutated from fish    second natural or artificial selection on a population is evolution since it changes the distribution of heritable traits in the population    only if you define it that way but with natural selection you dont have any new traits so there is that    are you denying that mutations exist and can be selected    mutations do exist but ive yet to see them beign hereditary grow a cow or an amoeba out of eschericia coli
  what does that mean in terms of new species being created asking in good faith they listed adaptation to different food of eschericia coli as mutation btw  its not a trait present in the original population that was increased over time it took thousands of generations for the mutation to arise    look up necessery vs sufficient argument on wiki  i already understand the distinction a change in heritable traits of a population is sufficient proof of evolution because it is the definition of evolution why do you think its insufficient    ffs mate natural selection and hereditary mechs was common knowldge for a few millenia  it was known that life evolved it was not known how until recently    which isnt sufficient proof we mutated from fish  the sufficient proof is in the fossil and genetic record which shows the sequences of descent if you wanted to discuss that then you should have said so from the start instead of denying that populations heritable traits change    only if you define it that way   i dont define it that way that is how the word is defined in general its not my fault that you are failing to communicate your argument by using words incorrectly    but with natural selection you dont have any new traits so there is that  new traits occur randomly due to mutations and can then be selected    mutations do exist but ive yet to see them beign hereditary   any mutation in the germline is hereditary are you saying that all mutations are outside the germline    grow a cow or an amoeba out of eschericia coli  that would take too long to be practical
  did popper know about dna rate of change
  not sure what you are refering but proof of mutations they presented is bacterias beign eable to process certain food which is meh findings since they most likely had that ability from start same as humans and lastose    you can study bacteria reproduce over many generations then introduce antibiotics and observe how many die out but some will randomly develop mutations resistent against antibiotics and see how they are selected      which doesnt mean it was the right move to do doesnt it  it doesnt but many standardly accepted theories are superseded this way read what is this thing called science detailing philosophy and history in science it shows arguments from philosophers and real life examples from history about how falsification is a poor description about how science advances many theories are directly falsified early on but survive and alot of theories become popular without the need for any competing theory to be falsified         isnt sufficient proof we mutated from fish    given the great ammount of evidence that is suggestive of common descent eg in fossil records genetics etc and the fact we have a fleshed out mechanism of geno and phenotype change in natural selection that is empirically demonstrable i think its up to you guys to prove that we didnt come from a common ancestor with fish macroevolution is just a logical consequence from microevolution
  its not a trait present in the original population that was increased over time    and how can you so sure about that did they even tested it plenty of traits are present in the genotype but not in phenotype    they retroactivly fished for conclusions it wasnt even their initial hypothesis bunch of fags    a change in heritable traits of a population is sufficient proof of evolution because it is the definition of evolution    it absolutly isnt sufficient i can change the breeds of dogs by breeding them is that evolution    the sufficient proof is in the fossil and genetic record which shows the sequences of descent    fossil record is a total joke it already happened a few times that they mistook a bone from a person with disability from year 1000 for a fossil of some common anscestor    new traits occur randomly due to mutations and can then be selected    youve seen humans born with 6 fingers try breeding them    any mutation in the germline is hereditary are you saying that all mutations are outside the germline    are you saying that all mutations are outside the germline    what do you mean by outside the germline     a cow or an amoeba out of eschericia coli  that would take too long to be practical    why is breeding an amoeba too much to ask
  i can change the breeds of dogs by breeding them is that evolution  def of evolution  the process by which different kinds of living organisms are thought to have developed and diversified from earlier forms during the history of the earth  so yes your attempt to disprove evolution with semantics has failed anon take a break
  itt op doesnt understand the difference between a theory and a hypothesis
  your attempt to disprove evolution with semantics has failed anon    you are the one using semantics if you put dog breeding as proof
  youre the one harping about evolution i gave a definition artificial selection meets that definition cope
  artificial selection meets that definition    its a bad definition dumbass since yec is also evolutionor is evolution also yec
  yec  young earth creationism whats your definition of evolution
  help me out then give me something to read
  why are you making shit up about me i could do it but you have not given me a reason to    either respond to the argument or admit defeat  you lost the argument you cant give a real world example which has a valid mechanism behind it because it cant exist thus your belief is unfalsifiable i actually did give a real world example with the dog cancer but you refused to acknowledge it was valid because it would immediately falsify ns and you cant have that so i asked for a valid one and you couldnt deliver your premise hinges on giving a valid real world answer with a mechanism behind it but you cant do it which is why you dodged the question call it a demand if you want i dgaf    your falsification premise requires organisms within a species to have no differences whatsoever perfect physical and behavioral copies except for genetic code absurd but ill at least pretend this is possible for arguments sake you wont get that luxury anymore yet at the same time a certain set of genetic code among the organisms somehow makes them more fit despite no noncode differences     this is blatantly self contradicting and defeats causality fitness is a physical outcome its not possible to consistently have different physical outcomes beyond random chance with the same physical input i didnt catch this at the beginning because i did not realize you have such an overlybroad definition of phenotype this is why you cant give an example theres no such thing youd have to invent metaphysical nonsense to make up an example that satisfies your falsifiability premise     im asking you why you need an example from me  its a discussion about falsifiability your abstract/general falsifiability premise cant have a real and specific example with an identified mechanism because it would force you to admit its impossible to achieve hence you refused to give one 3 times now and will embarrassingly continue to do so still need that example btw
   i can change the breeds of dogs by breeding them is that evolution  yes    youve seen humans born with 6 fingers try breeding them  irrational bias that you assume all mutations are weird explicit things like 6 fingers you also assume all mutations are directly observable regardless of the truth of the matter i also vet you just assume 6 fingers arent heritable and you are arguing out of shit like an ignorant arsenal fan would    why is breeding an amoeba too much to ask  stfu
whoever this nigger is that doesnt believe in macroevolution accept you lost because you refuse to reply to any good points ive given you just ignore the fact your argument is full of shit
  and how can you so sure about that did they even tested it  yes thats the point of the experiment    they retroactivly fished for conclusions it wasnt even their initial hypothesis bunch of fags  youre so desperate to deny reality yet so incompetent at it its pretty funny    it absolutly isnt sufficient i can change the breeds of dogs by breeding them is that evolution  yes what dont you understand about a change in a populations heritable traits doesnt it disturb you that you still dont understand the definition of the concept youre trying to talk about    fossil record is a total joke it already happened a few times that they mistook a bone from a person with disability from year 1000 for a fossil of some common anscestor  well i guess we just have to ignore all evidence then since sometimes humans make mistakes so desperate    youve seen humans born with 6 fingers try breeding them  so no mutations exist that can be selected what exactly stops every single mutation from being selected    what do you mean by outside the germline  the germline is the set of cells containing the genetic material that can be passed on to offspring so in order for your argument to work you need some kind of magic force that keeps the germline free from mutations not only from being mutated but from getting mutations that occured when the organism was first formed for example a mutation in a fertilized egg will be carried through to all the new cells in the organism body but your argument is that the new germline cells magically avoid having their genetic material copied from the mutated first cells its hilarious    why is breeding an amoeba too much to ask  because it would take too long
  you cant give a real world example which has a valid mechanism behind it because it cant exist thus your belief is unfalsifiable   i can literally any population with heritable traits is an example you lost the argument and so invented an arbitrary demand in order to declare victory pathetic     i actually did give a real world example with the dog cancer but you refused to acknowledge it was valid because it would immediately falsify ns and you cant have that  your example failed because it had a change in a trait that could be selected the point is to show that no such change in trait exists to be selected yet a directional change in genotype is still found you fail at very basic logic    take a population of dogs no change in their traits is observed thus there is nothing for nature to select but a change in genotype is observed the experiment is repeated and the same change in genotype is always found without any change in traits that can be selected thus the theory that selection produces the change in genotype is falsified theres your example note fuck off    this is blatantly self contradicting and defeats causality   yes it defeats the causeeffect relationship between a trait affecting the reproductive success of an organism and the propogation of the genotype encoding that trait youre denying such a well evidenced and obvious causality you    its not possible to consistently have different physical outcomes beyond random chance with the same physical input  what are the different outcomes    your abstract/general falsifiability premise cant have a real and specific example with an identified mechanism because it would force you to admit its impossible to achieve  its only impossible to achieve if the theory of natural selection is true you actually know that natural selection is true you just dont know what the words youre using mean
evolution is a fact populations of organisms change over time  natural selection meanwhile is a theory
  why is breeding an amoeba too much to ask  cytologically an amoeba is more similar to a human than to a bacterium if you dont understand just how different eubacteria are from eukaryotes that just shows your ignorance of biology
  neither is big bang
  evolution is no different than historiosophy or mythology its activity is always from present to past constant revisionism not from present to future predicting like a good scientific theory    you can predict what will happen to bacteria under the pressure of antibiotics you can test if this happens you can do the same thing with lots of different kinds of evolutionary pressure and lots of different organisms
people will submit that humans have bred dogs from wolves over thousands of years yet still dispute evolution in 2018
how does jewolution account for wings and flying wouldnt any precursor to wings just be a completely useless and disadvantageous appendage to drag around until it could actually be used to fly for probably hundreds of generations
  all domesticated animals are literally mentally crippled/retarded versions of their originals they bred the ones that were too dumb to get caught and too dumb to escape plus a lot of inbreeding on top domestication  retardation
  gliding is useful too even mostly uncontrolled gliding is good when your predators cant keep up with it
  one generation youre going to have arms and the very next therell be a magic mutation that gives enough skin and tendons to enable it to glide around in a functional purposeful way why dont modern bears and monkeys start flying around
  search up wing assisted incline running in birds if you want the latest of how flight evolved in birds however take care to note that birds all have very similar body plans  flying is very specialized so you cant really have the morphology of a bear and even glide    bats probably evolved flight because the could better catch prey gliding from trees
  no the flap of skin starts off smaller and used for some other purpose like temperature control eventually the skin flaps get large enough and arranged correctly to allow limited gliding it doesnt even need to be steerable it probably first started as a method to slow falls to help arboreal animals survive falling from a tall tree
  the theory of evolution makes certain predictions  among the most obvious are what you will find in the fossil record    it would be easily falsified by findings in the fossil record that contradicted it    or are you confusing darwins theory of natural selection with the more generally theory that new life forms arise from old ones over time evolution
  i can literally any population with heritable traits is an example you lost the argument and so invented an arbitrary demand in order to declare victory pathetic  you refused this a 4th time now unbelievable    thus the theory that selection produces the change in genotype is falsified theres your example note fuck off  thats not an example that is again the general/abstract premise give an organism we can observe this in and how it can happen its impossible because it escapes causality merely saying if it happens is not an example     this is blatantly self contradicting and defeats causality   yes it defeats the causeeffect relationship between a trait affecting the reproductive success of an organism and the propogation of the genotype encoding that trait youre denying such a well evidenced and obvious causality you  youre so close to admitting youre wrong but you just cant its fascinating a completely ingrained mental block in order for your falsification premise to be fulfilled you must defeat causality which is impossible its on the tip of your tongue youre even admitting the underlying concept defeats causality but instead of acknowledging its your premise that must rely on defeating causality you erroneously assume its my understanding of your premise that must defeat causality it would be soo simple to prove me wrong if you would only give a real world example but you just cant do it youre so close just admit it and admit youre wrong
  you  i remember you  you did this same post exactly one year ago here on /sci/  and i even answered you multiple times   i wont get over it again   but fees nice having recognized you after all this time nonetheless
  i had to split this up because its the first time in a long time youve said something which warranted a valid in depth response     its only impossible to achieve if the theory of natural selection is true  oh boy in order for something to be falsifiable there must exist a way to find a valid observation to disprove that something youre saying your observation needed for falsification can only not exist if ns is true but that is utterly false your claimed falsification observation is merely illogical to begin with and thus can never exist by default     its like saying 113 is only impossible to achieve if god exists is true gods nature would prohibit that but 113 is self contradictory it can never be true regardless if god exists     hence just because your natural selection falsification premise is impossible to achieve by default it has nothing to do with natural selection being true the fact your example cannot exist doesnt prove ns true thats an idiotic armchair argument moreover the fact that its impossible to achieve regardless if ns is true or not means its a completely invalid falsification premise for ns in the first place and youve failed to understand this the entire time     you need to find an example which is both logically possible not inherently illogical like your armchair argument you call a general/abstract example which is inherently contradictory and is also capable of falsifying natural selection you cannot do this because ns is unfalsifiable       less relevant by i might as well respond  what are the different outcomes  passing on genes or traits to a better extent than others is a physical outcome this should have been obvious to be quite honest you saying a trait which gets passed on that has no phenotype changes is a contradiction in itself according to what youve said anything in your genome which is not expressed is by default not a trait
  all domesticasted animals are literally mentally crippled/retarded versions of their originals  not only is this irrelevant but domestic/feral cats are slightly smarter than their wild cousins
  you refused this a 4th time now unbelievable  you refused to explain why i need to acquiesce to your arbitrary demand unbelievable    thats not an example  yes it is     give an organism we can observe this in  i already gave you an organism dogs it can be observed in any population with heritable traits do you deny that such populations exist    and how it can happen  what do you mean if you mean explain what it would look like ive already done that if you mean explain how a directional change in genotype could occur without a trait being selected then you are asking me to explain your own position im not a mind reader but i would guess that its something along the lines of god did it your position makes no sense to me but luckily for you you dont have to understand how natural selection would be falsified in order to falsify it     its impossible because it escapes causality   it only escapes causality if ns is the only causal possibility which you deny obviously such a falsification would require us to find a new causal mechanism like god doing it or leprechauns doing it its funny because you are literally arguing that your own position escapes causality    merely saying if it happens is not an example   what you dont seem to realize is that all to say that something is falsifiable is always an if statement ive already given you an example but you dont want an example you want an explanation of your own position    oh boy in order for something to be falsifiable there must exist a way to find a valid observation to disprove that something  there is ive given it to you if natural selection is false then there is no reason you shouldnt observe the falsification
the two guys arguing in this thread are both complete morans
  youre saying your observation needed for falsification can only not exist if ns is true but that is utterly false  no im not im saying the only way it can exist is if ns is false o  ns is not equivalent to o  ns once again you fail at basic logic    in order for your falsification premise to be fulfilled you must defeat causality which is impossible  this is only true if ns is the only causal mechanism possible a falsification would imply that its not    youre even admitting the underlying concept defeats causality   not quite it defeats a well evidenced causeeffect relationship it either implies that there is a previously unknown causal mechanism or that causality is broken    it would be soo simple to prove me wrong if you would only give a real world example but you just cant do it  what do you mean by example
  its like saying 113 is only impossible to achieve if god exists is true gods nature would prohibit that but 113 is self contradictory it can never be true regardless if god exists   11  is impossible by definition how is it impossible to observe a directional change in genotype without a trait that can be selected    hence just because your natural selection falsification premise is impossible to achieve by default  how is it impossible to achieve    the fact your example cannot exist doesnt prove ns true  how many times are you going to repeat this without explaining how its impossible    moreover the fact that its impossible to achieve regardless if ns is true or not  four times    you need to find an example which is both logically possible not inherently illogical like your armchair argument you call a general/abstract example which is inherently contradictory  five times apparently    passing on genes or traits to a better extent than others is a physical outcome  yes but the theory says that any such directional change must be caused by selection if there is nothing to select in the first place then it cannot be caused by selection thus the theory is contradicted     to be quite honest you saying a trait which gets passed on that has no phenotype changes is a contradiction in itself according to what youve said  traits being passed on in the same distribution from one generation to the next is not a change in phenotype where is the contradiction    anything in your genome which is not expressed is by default not a trait  yes and
   how it can happen  what do you mean  if you mean explain what it would look like ive already done that   yes clearly this is your general/abstract explanation i keep referring to that is self contradictory ive even paraphrased it numerous times youve even said you dont have to give an example after ive paraphrased it from the example you gave     if you mean explain how a directional change in genotype could occur without a trait being selected then you are asking me to explain your own position  this is whats required for the general/abstract explanation to actually happen this is what you have refused to provide 5 times now its not my position its whats required to fulfill your falsifiability premise its impossible for you to give an example hence now you are dodging and pretending its my responsibility its downright absurd your mental pretzeling is beyond belief and i can see now it will not end     youve come up with this pure idiocy that since you cant give an example of how that can happen it must mean ns is true the armchair argument i showed how thats absurd with my 11 3 exapmle and you just obfuscated to the point i cant even respond you even have to resort to saying 11  is impossible by definition in   saying something that incredibly stupid to weasel out of the logically contradicting hole youve dug yourself into is enough for me to stop responding     there is ive given it to you if natural selection is false then there is no reason you shouldnt observe the falsification  again this is a circular reasoning armchair argument it is impossible for you to give an example and to avoid that youve had to convince yourself i have to produce an explanation of how a directional change in genotype could occur without a trait being selected a premise you created when its what is needed to falsify ns
  how is it impossible to observe a directional change in genotype without a trait that can be selected  how is it impossible to achieve  how many times are you going to repeat this without explaining how its impossible  four times  five times apparently    well you think its my own position now and assume it can only happen via god doing it now so thats a good start    but to repeat myself it would defeat causality its impossible to observe because it would violate causality i explained this here  but youve asked me again 5 times now you do seem to be selectively editing what the discussion is about and ignoring that the falsifiability premise involved fitness of course a directional change in genotype could happen without a trait being selected thats could just accidentally happen via random chance theres no valid mechanism for a directional change to happen in a genotype without a trait being selected that also improved fitness however i think youre just shotgunning replies without even remembering what was said at this point     im pretty sure im done here go make a thread in /sci/ and tell everyone 11  is impossible by definition and count how many people laugh at you and tell you youre out of your mind
  yes clearly this is your general/abstract explanation i keep referring to that is self contradictory ive even paraphrased it numerous times youve even said you dont have to give an example after ive paraphrased it from the example you gave  is there an actual response here youre devolving into babble what exactly do you want    this is whats required for the general/abstract explanation to actually happen  thats not how reality works your ability to predict what causal mechanisms are present in reality does not somehow constrain reality you are basically saying that an experiment which results in something we were not expecting cannot happen in reality this happens all the time     its whats required to fulfill your falsifiability premise  how is it required you keep demanding it but you have not explained why     its impossible for you to give an example  i already did though an example would be god changing the genotype    i showed how thats absurd with my 11 3 exapmle and you just obfuscated to the point i cant even respond  you cant even respond because 11 3 is impossible by definition while my experiment is not you keep claiming that its impossible but cant explain why you lost    saying something that incredibly stupid  so 11  3 is not impossible by definition    well you think its my own position now and assume it can only happen via god doing it now so thats a good start  no thats just an example it could happen in many ways that we can think of or cant even guess    but to repeat myself it would defeat causality  no it doesnt god causing the genotype to change is still causality defeating causality would mean nothing causes the genotype to change but i dont see how you can say this is impossible either its all theoretically possible but highly unlikely based on our scientific knowledge
  of course a directional change in genotype could happen without a trait being selected thats could just accidentally happen via random chance  repetition of the experiment eliminates that possibility i addressed this in the original post    theres no valid mechanism for a directional change to happen in a genotype without a trait being selected that also improved fitness however  if by valid you mean in line with our scientific understanding which includes the theory of natural selection of course the entire point of falsification is that it invalidates what we thought was valid    go make a thread in /sci/ and tell everyone 11  is impossible by definition and count how many people laugh at you and tell you youre out of your mind  ah the final desperate tactic of the loser take a typo as an argument     thanks for admitting defeat retard

thanks everyone for the last thread we left off with uranium peroxide decomposed into uo3 in an oven and redissolved in nitric acid     i then placed some of the aggressively yellow solution it yielded in a mason jar along with some aluminiumfree drain cleaner sodium hydroxide to dry after 48 hours the utterly uvopaque solution solidified forming crystals of brightly glowing uranyl nitrate im using quotation marks because the crystal size is extremely small indicating poor purity right now im attributing this to the presence of nitric acid in the solution
forgot pic
when i came home today i found this bit of salt creep climbing the petry dish not a minute too early because it was right at the edge any base would have utterly destroyed the uranium solution i opened the jar to wipe away the salt and noticed a caustic smell and the petry dish was fuming this is how i know there is definitely an excess of acid
are you using any radiation shielding i feel like this is a surefire way to get cancer
the yellow crust itself is very radioactive but with very little gamma radiation this tells me i removed everything above radium which is the purity i should settle with anyway    there is more yellow solution in another dish but a black component of the baked yellowcake never dissolved even after adding water im struggling to separate the solution because the black dust is very fine and takes forever to settle in the viscous solution i added what i could to the drying dish before closing the jar back up this time with a beaker to keep the salt at a distance im also out of sodium hydroxide and nitric acid and im not even half way through the uranium    i know someone who can buy nitric acid through their company but can anyone tell me who sells it to individuals in germany i bought mine on amazon three years ago theyve taken it down since
okay but what does it taste like
  below radium duh  i always thought pure uranium wouldnt produce strong radiation because its a slow alpha emitter but it turns out its direct daughter thorium234 will undergo two steps of beta decay very quickly purified uranium will build up beta radiation over a course of 4 days      1m of distance and the glass holding the sample is all the shielding i need here im hardly picking up any radiation from the jar and only little from the pet bottles    speaking of which this is all the uranium left to process on the left is some uo4 on the right some adu
finally for your consideration here is some naturally fluorescent uranium ore autunite just to prove to you guys im not fucking with you    i actually got this rock from an unassuming teacher in high school will post story if interested
  1m of distance and the glass holding the sample is all the shielding i need here im hardly picking up any radiation from the jar and only little from the pet bottles  i didnt read your previous threads just stumbled on your project for the first time just wanted to be sure youre using the right type of geiger counter geiger counters in general are not sensitive to all types of radiation just wanted to check if you know what yours is sensitive to and what you expect the majority of the radiation to be    cool project though will be keeping an eye on it
mmmmods
  this thread has infinitely more quality than all the other shit posts on this board be happy someone actually does some cool shit and wants to share it with us
reported to feds
explain the significance of this to a lowly mechanical engineer like myself
  1m of distance and the glass holding the sample is all the shielding i need here  neat maybe consider some tinfoil anyways whats the end game mini nuclear reactor    side note you should be able to buy dilute nitric acid and concentrate it on the stove if you cant find any commercially then check out synthesis using copper ii nitrate
  its glowing in the dark
  youre crazy
  thanks for coming back
      to newcomers  i took a piece of uranium ore uraninite which is available to individuals as a mineral for collections and dissolved it in nitric acid to make uranyl nitrate im interested in the compound because its a very simple inorganic salt that is fluorescent its radioactivity is adding to my excitement because it ticks all the boxes for a cliché dangerous chemical youve ever seen toxic corrosive radioactive glows green    i am not planning to build a reactor nor is it possible to construct one with this uranium this chemical is not much worse than say dichromate the end goal is to display it in a nice little ampule over an ultraviolet led    pic related is a chunk of the coveted substance large parts of it not glowing because of impurities in the previous thread we discussed possible contaminants in the solution and ways to separate them the method at work right now is this    1 dissolve uraninite in nitric acid  2 add sodium sulfate to eliminate alkaline earths especially radium  3 neutralize ph and add sodium sulfide to precipitate lead and some transition metals i did not have sulfide so i skipped this step  4 add ammonia solution to precipitate ammonium diuranate  5 wash the adu and redissolve it in nitric acid  6 neutralize ph and precipitate uranium peroxide using hydrogen peroxide solution  7 wash dry and heat the peroxide to 200c for 20 minutes decomposing it into uranium trioxide  8 redissolve uranium trioxide in nitric acid  9 crystallize in a dessicator
  but what iq does it have anon
  brightly glowing uranyl nitrate  wwhat       add some arabic text to the bottles and you will have the undivided attention of many    more seriously uranium also decompose via radon a nasty radioactive gas how do you deal with this
  radon a nasty radioactive gas how do you deal with this  plastic bag over head with tube running from bottle to plastic bag inhale deeply
  i dont consider the quantity of radiation i receive from this sample via any pathway a danger unless i spill the solution on myself     i estimate about 510kbq of radon to be coming off this sample at any moment even if i keep it in my room all day it will only increase the radon concentration by a factor of 10100 ie i would be breathing that much radon in a year anyway
  wtf this nigga building nuke or something
  be me  notice snow disappears early in spring  nobody thinks anything about it  notice lake never freezes over even in 35 c winters  nobody cares  hears of a cancer cluster nearby  people wonder but that is all and is there any sports on tv now focus on the important things in life you know  physicist time to look into it get a geological map  area is full of granite  not where these houses are my neighbours say  hmmmm  look closer realise there is an old silver mine some way away realise this can be found with really bad stuff  get a second map area is full of black slate  uhoh  not where these houses are my neighbours say  experimental physicist enough bovine excreta get a radon detector  first reading twice the recommended limit further readings up to 5 x the limit  neighbours wife dies of lung cancer shurely just a coincidence just like all the others in that area  notify neighbours they suddenly see a need for radon detectors  another neighbour sees way over the limits installs serious ventilation system  determine i live in a reactor time to bring in counter measures
  radon is radioactive but not nasty in any way what it decays into is and when it gets into the body acts like heavy metals and gets deposited throughout the body it never gets out   basically radon comes into your home through the floor decays you breath it in before or after decay and builds into your body puffing out happy little beta and alpha particles inside you
  yyo jokin right
    thats technically true radon decays into polonium bismuth and lead emitting alpha radiation while inside your body nobody will disagree that this is the most harmful way to receive radiation but heres the catch there is fuck all radon in the air it wont give you metal toxicity at all and if you took enough radon to make that significant you would die from acute radiation sickness a disease completely unheard of before marie curie long before the toxicity kicked in
  rip op        should have had a robot do the chemistry for you remotely    d
  nooooooooooo
today was a good day to visit /sci got a 1 to iq off this thread alone
  holy moly well this is the best thread on /sci/
to be honest i thought one of you nuts opened some sort of dimensional portal yet was not disappoint
    oh cruelest fate
  pls rember that wen u feel scare or frigten  never forget ttimes wen u feeled happy    wen day is dark alway rember happy day    rip in piece op
  what happens if you swallow some
  it matters not op is already a dead man walking
  alright i cant help myself i have to post the story i swear to god it happened like this    be me 14  find people on youtube playing with uranium  radioactivity instantly captivates me i must own something radioactive  get (((my moms boyfriend))) to buy me a geiger counter  i get free glassware and chemicals from school already so this isnt that weird relatively speaking  it arrives  immediately turn it on and point it at random shit  literally nothing is radioactive  what a fucking surprise am i right  notice some subtle radiation over time its higher on the ground granite almost always sticks out  bring it to school  geography classroom has mineral samples  yeah right  give it a try  radiation actually fucking increases in one spot  i take the rock to teacher show him the radiation  he is actually scared tells me it needs to be disposed of  i say ill throw it in a river  he actually gives it to me  mfw    break time  show my friends  tell them the yellow shit glows in the dark  was completely fucking made up at that point  they believe it  pfft  take it home  turn on uv light  it actually fucking glows  mfw  been into radioactivity ever since
  tt    did you breath in radon fucking gas
  the yellow crust itself is very radioactive  have you checked if it is sufficient to energize solar cells there is a video of a guy placing tritium sources on a small solar cell and it generates enough electricity to flash a led might also try a fluorescent material inbetween such as from the inside of fluorescent tubes
  nice idea but my sample is not that strong apart from the need for a way to turn the radiation into visible light to make it compatible with the solar cells my uranium produces a few orders of magnitude less power than a dizen tritium sticks
ophomer simpson
  look up betavoltaics and the related alphavoltaics it might still work
for reference this was the previous thread  
  how much did you pay for the uranium ore mass used
  where exactly is this
  detective time  you dont have sodium sulfide a reagent that is widely used for industry and can be bought easily assuming that you dont buy your chemicals you must be using them from school  or uni why isnt anyone questioning you explain op
  bad ventilation can lead to radon enrichment in the air as per   and then you get cancer before any lousy radiation sickness
  you never heard of miners sickness then
  also wasnt there a guy assasinated by polonium poisoning in the soviet union they used an umbrella and a small metal ball with pores po inside the pores and sealed with sugar was a slow and painful dreadful death iirc  damn ruskies love their radiation poisoning
what the fuck am i reading
  literal cancer
this is rad op
  northern europe being more exact would give you my address that combination of geological features narrows things down a lot      bad ventilation can lead to radon enrichment in the air as per   correct i noticed reading depended on wind direction and then discovered all ventilation was on one side of the house so wind from the north created an under pressure in the house extracting more radon through the basement floors i added more vents and created a slight over pressure to keep the radon gas down
  i dont remember the mass of the rock but ill just say it was an ounce or less cost me 10      i do buy chemicals but i never bought sulfide and i just couldnt be bothered to i get everything through amazon and ebay actually not a specialist because im a poorfag      i guess i just keep my room ventilated also the radium is gone dont forget that      in 1879 the wasting was identified as lung cancer by herting and hesse in their investigation of miners  ie not acute radiation sickness      alexander litvinenko was assassinated using polonium but they slipped it in his drink or something the pellet shot from an umbrella story was georgi markov and he was killed using ricin
  the key thing to unserstand here is that in radioactive decay chains each nuclide is in equilibrium between its production and its decay when left alone each stage will build up top to bottom to the point where just as many atoms are decaying as are being produced in uranium the chain is pretty straightforward each element having one decay pathway with 99 likelihood    compared to all of its successors uranium has by far the longest half life meaning its decay speed will remain practically constant over the course of decay product accumulation the way the math works out the activity of a daughter nuclide will build up in the same exponential decay fashion with the same half life as the daughter until it asymptotically matches its rate of production from the parent isotope this makes sense a very short lived product will immediately start decaying at the same rate its being produced while a more stable isotope will just sit there for a while at first but then begin decaying until steady state is reached    in practice this means we can know both the total activity of polonium that was and will ever be in the mass of uranium ore and all the stuff i poured away as well as its quantity assuming the starting mass of uranium was such that it had an activity of 10kbq so will be the activity of thorium radium radon and polonium finally the ratio of masses between the nuclides is the same as the ratio between their half lives we can calculate the quantities of each isotope now    uranium238 1 gram 131017 seconds  thorium234 1014 grams 14103 seconds  polonium210 1010 grams 12107 seconds
  we can actually calculate the radiation dose the polonium would deliver to somebody if you ingest it its reasonable to assume that the entirety of decay energy will be absorbed by your body knowing the quantity of polonium we can calculate its energy content    12 million seconds  12kbq  141011 atoms  141011 atoms  5mev  71017ev or 22 millijoules spread out over your wet body mass this comes out to about 1msv or the dose of a chest xray notably though this means were about 34 orders of magnitude away from a lethal dose so a few pounds of uranium ore will contain enough polonium to kill a politician trips decides
    now i have to justify my numbers here a little the specific activity of uranium is 12kbq per gram which is what i used for my calculations the 10kbq was unnecessarily rounded    this also means i have about an order of magnitude more radon coming from the radium beaker than i expected oops im gonna open my window now    by the way here is the other chunk of uranium ore i own it weighs about a pound and a half its radioactivity is impressive string enough to cause sensor artifacts in a completely dark room and to expose photographic film
  ha so youre white were on to you now fucko    //fbi
  your fingerprint is visible
  i only wish my school days were a tenth as fun as this  where could your school even have gotten it from though

  go to the press and cause a major stink class action lawsuit is probable
      and heres how i got the uraninite    be me later that same year  be friends with technetium woman  she is going to the czech border to visit the uranium mines  thats a fucking brilliant idea lets do it  decide to meet with her  tell mom and boyfriend i want to go on a vacation  where to anon  the uranium mines in saxony    her boyfriend realized the opportunity to get cheap cigarettes and fake brand clothes in shady czech border shops  they agree to go  spend a week having fun seeing stuff buying tons of cheap shit  never actually meet the woman because schedules but she hides a note under a bridge which i find  pic related  disappointingly uranium is not literally laying in the streets and mines arent just holes in a wall that anyone can climb into with a jackhammer  dont find any uranium  to be continued
  on last day decide to go to a store for minerals and gems  the entire area is known as the place where uranium was discovered so the store does have uranium ore  little me is exploring aisles and aisles of beautiful crystals quartz sulfur beryl amethyst geodes you name it they got it  finally come up to the clerk  well well well got a stone you like  yeah i want some pitchblende  guy is immediately nervous  uh are you sure looking at my guardians rather than me  they say yes in a tone of resignation  well i got this one and this one  he places two little pieces of ore on the counter one tiny one and a slightly larger one  pic related  i whip out my geiger counter and start measuring the rocks  most intense radiation i had ever seen  my face lights up with manic glee  wow thats so cool do you have a bigger one  to be continued
  clerk is completely helpless now  uh yeah i guess hold on  he disappears in a back room  comes back holding  with gloves  radiation increases from 6ft away  he places it on the table  intense radiation in the whole room from all the uranium  geiger counter is not even clicking anymore just sounds like static  awesome i want all three  my mom and her lover spend 120 on uranium for me  during the entire ride home the radiation levels in the car are 10x normal  decide the next cool thing to do is throw one of the rocks into acid  pic related is a recreation of the initial step
  wtf this story only gets worse how are you still alive     d
  itt op developed radiation resistance    much like the common cockaroach that exposed itself to alot of radon gas in the mines it inhabitted long ago
    rad resistance  in one lifetime   in a single generation     d o u b t
  how is that unbelievable though you can gain resistance to things over 1 generation through exposure
  mfw op gets to live because he is a healthy boi    its not fair  its not fucking fair     my genetics make peanuts kill me    why is this mother fucking ghoul rad resistant
  ghoul    lol
  toppus kekus
op youre a magnificent bastard good luck in your experiments
   and then op mutated into a superfaggot 
itt op loses smoothskin status
the petry dish is almost dry but the solid uranyl salt is still goopy rather than powdery i suspect there is a lot of nitric acid left that wont go away i understand nitric acid does evaporate but does anyone have experience with the rate of evaporation im using sodium hydroxide as the desiccant which should capture nitric acid vapor as fast as anythng can how long do you think that will take days weeks
            faggots that dont understand how radiation works    itt but muh lnt
  blow it with a hairdryer
  yeah do that that totally wont blow all the radioactive particles into the air for you to breathe in and get a good ol lung cancer from
  (((my moms boyfriend)))  holy shit lmao
  can someone eli5 how this guy isnt dead is the radiation just really low intensity
  radiation is simply overrated you are exposed to it all the time and the amount it takes to give you cancer is not that low this is why people dont usually freak out about having a ct scan done   people think of radioactive stuff like poison if you take enough of it you die this isnt true if youre not handling materials so radioactive they produce appreciable amounts of heat its more like smoking cigarettes its a deadly lottery and your chance of winning depends on how many tickets you buy i dont smoke cigarettes     did you know a significant part of the cancer risk from cigarettes comes from radioactive lead and polonium in the leaves
  so this whole thread is some idiot that thinks fluorescing under uv light is the same as radiation glow lmao
  eli5  dont post here any more
finally an interesting thread on /sci/ after all these years
hi bionerd i love your stories have a bump
  how did you know what that meant
  because some dumb nigger posted it on /k/ and got roasted to death last week
    what does it mean
  it means that the post is extremely low quality
  thanks
progress report  i have added the last salvageable batch of uranyl solution to the desiccator dish even though it was less than 2ml it redissolved all the previously solidified compound this is not an issue just a surprise to me the solution is now about as thick as maple syrup    one thing i noticed after the second addition was that the crystals were larger and more distinct maybe a portion of the nitric acid has evaporated and allowed the uranyl to crystallize better the air in the jar was no longer stinging in my nose    the rest of the solution from the petry dish i diluted in some water waited for the black solid to settle out in a test tube then precipitated the uranium once again using hydrogen peroxide this time the solid is very light in color just like the very first batch this makes me much more confident in its quality uranyl peroxide is described as being a light yellow color one thing i cant explain right now is why the solution is still yellow i expect nothing but uranyl nitrate and nitric acid in the solution at this point and hydrogen peroxide should be able to fully precipitate the uranium either way i will collect the solution and run it through another base treatment ill probably finish eventually    i also have all the remaining uranium in uo4 form in one beaker now im waiting for it to settle so i can dry and bake it i want to do two rounds of peroxide/bake/acid with this batch too seeing as the color of the peroxide now is more like peanut butter     before i can add the last of the uranium into the dish i need to get more nitric acid

ethical issues and memes aside what are the actual scientific implications of this what can we learn from the children  also ive seen a lot of people saying lulu and nana should be sterilized i personally think that would be a massive overreaction but what is /sci/s opinion on the issue
also video from the man himself  
  we can learn that there will always be retarded faggots scared of change
should we stifle natural scientific progress because of our unnatural sense of morality    if nuclear weapons had been developed just 2 decades earlier would there have a been a world war 2
what exactly is the ethical issue here how exactly is gene editing a problem but natural mutations and issues arising from natural recombination errors and other sources not random chance gets a free pass and a host of acceptance movements based on kinds of often contrived arguments and human rights legalisms but human intervention must pass the highest bar ridiculous
dude was literally trying to cure hiv  its a shame cucks like this are too scared of designer baby tyrone banging their wives with 13 inch cocks
  this
  we have to wait unitl he publish the papers until then any speculation is to early
this is it this mentality denouncing science that objectively improves peoples lives and alleviates suffering in the longest of terms ideas that fundamentally shake up the status quo shut down discussed to death penalized into oblivion were seeing the great filter in action
  is it literally just people being scared of kids being smarter/stronger than them
what did he actually do what did he aim to change exactly
                the fact there are so many morons here who cannot possible conceive exactly why this research was so flawed and unethical simply shows how lowbrow this board in in attracting supposed intellectual science types yo people are shameless and on the same level as the science fuck yes crowd you deride so much
  he edited ccr5 a gene that codes for hiv receptors to recreate a mutation that renders the receptors useless effictively creating a natural immunity to hiv or at least the common type that enters ccr5 there are some rarer types which do not    because gene editing is not perfect right now the girls were still mosaic for ccr5 and likely have functioning ccr5 receptors this was more for science than for their benefit
  explain yourself please    what was so flawed and unethical the parents agreed to it or is it because the procedure didnt follow the law
  lol fags mad that 200 iq kids are coming for his doctorate  so glad i went into genetics cant wait to make a boatload of money doing genetic counseling for rich peoples designer kids retire early and sit back and wait for postnatal gene modification
  hiv is a minor problem for developed nations anyway just the fact that it worked is good news because it allows targeting of other genes
  the problem is that most critisism is just paniced fearmongering than a constructive scientific analysis on what is the stand of the things one of the few good reflection on the occurence is here  
  what is coerced consent  what is bypassing reb  what is designing an absolute shit experiment and actually going through with it without any official oversight    not to mention he broke the law    someone skipped bioethics 101 in undergrad
why did the chinese shut down his work i thought they supported this stuff wholeheartedly
once designer humans procreate there is no turning back we have no idea what longterm effects are    i fully agree with   
  he received consent from the parents there is no evidence that he bypassed any chinese ethics boards whats wrong with the experiment    i think/hope china is just pretending to care for pr purposes
im going to laugh so hard when retards see their entire no no no were all equal nonsense get absolutely destroyed by chinks
   there is no turning back we have no idea what longterm effects are  yeah xd i guess we should never even try to progress since we cant know what will happen lets just stagnate instead im sure there will be no consequences for that
  chances are that china did shut that one guy down but moved the research to someone else i doubt theyd just abandon the topic but the man got just too much media attention for them to keep him on the project
  we arent omniscient so we should be apathetic and idle
    your right progressprogress progress its the only thing thst matters in lifei agreewho cares about the potential ramifications of genetic engineering or ai we wouldnt want to stagnateso long as we have our heads up our arses it doesnt matter  subhumans literally defending becoming subhuman
  its less moral for you to naturally birth a child who will be ugly sickly weak dumb and short if you can hugely improve their lives before their birth  alternately if you dont think this technology would improve them why not allow it to be researched at the very least
  based and genepilled
  kys you fucking mong everyone knows its possible and everyone knows its unethical he did it so youre the one being fucking retarded for not looking at the results      glad someone finally did it its a wellknown receptor and still very far away from multifactorial traits that get everyones panties in a twist    the girls were still mosaic  so either he didnt use embryos or the mutation was reversed/suppressed if youre going to be playing god at least do it right
  so no cat girls for me eh
ethical issues are bullshit
  hiv is a minor problem    this is only federal spending    30 billions a year  average cost per year is 30k per hiv person
  562000000000 is a minor problem    between 2000 and 2015 5626 billion went toward the hiv epidemic worldwide governments financed 576 percent of that total annual spending peaked at 497 billion in 2013 and declined to 489 billion in 2015 in 2015 residents of lowincome and lowermiddleincome nations accounted for 746 percent of all the years of life lost to hiv as well as years of disabilityfree life lost to the virus yet just 366 percent of total spending on the epidemic
  what are the actual scientific implications of this  it means were entering the next era of evolution
its another thread of people not understanding the optimization of the species
    bioethics    lol christcucked americans pls go and stay go     this is a transhuman chad board
yfw the horrible side effects start to emerge
  the ice climbers are real now
  yeah except instead of climbing ice they can get their assholes pozzed without actually getting pozzed
i fear that the market will shift away from trying to fix broken men to building strong children  i dont want to become the last generation of obsolete humans
  damn that guy smug as fuck shame china stopped the program i had faith in you china
  nigger youre gonna die anyway its your generation or the next    we cant babysit retards and sick people forever especially when we can unmake them especially retards they are a massive drain on the economy    as long as i die before the giant penis babies break ground im fine with it
  ethicists  your telling me theres a field i can go into where my job is telling other people whats right and wrong
parents willingly letting this dude do his thing isnt consent  getting a gun pointed at your face and doing what youre told is  liberalism was a mistake
  building strong children  thats always been the goal hell the jews whole oy vey were ending taysachs thing is really just a cover for autistically breeding supermen according to esoteric talmudic principles     this just takes the concept from nosehairs precisely 32cm outside of the nostril to 7 tall with a 200iq
  i remember when moralfags were laughed off of this board
  watch as these genes removed turn out to be vital to something stupid like making a common flu less fatal then they can cry about it unless they had been running countless simulations which was well in our grasp to do
  yeah this is actually why its so unethical it lets faggots do whatever they want without any negative consequences aids is also what saves us from africas population growing by 100x every day
  it wasnt unethical  their parents gave consent and so did the chinese government i think  it benefitted both the twins and humanity
  and the dumbest post in the thread award goes to 10179892 congratulations for the honor

pharmafags take years to develope one medicine and try it on rats before clinical trials and still dont use it because its effects are bad on humans  chink faggot decides its ok to fuck with kids genes just because their mommy said ok
  i fucking love science you moron
  have faith brother our day shall come
  this is what is going to happen among other tech breakthroughs bci vivo gene engineering as you say aging related drug design and tech
  strong children will help you ascend
    whats so unethical about raising the intelligence of the human species and eliminating all diseases
  theyre only mad that he made it public its secret supersoldier research now
  the law matters   fuck off
  can we cure downies
  watch as these genes removed turn out to be vital to something stupid like making a common flu less fatal  this is the biggest issue that sadly everyone in this thread seems to be ignoring  scientists arent upset about this because they were all secretly luddites bent on stopping the next stage of human evolution theyre upset because we just dont know what kinds of fucked up shit might happen when we fuck with genes whose purpose we dont fully understand  thats why its unethical were effectively using the lives of those two kids as test beds at this point all we can do is sit back and see what happens but that doesnt make the choice that got us here any less wrong
how much of skill is based on training and how much is based on talent and for that matter how much of physical ability is based on exercise and good diet and how much is based on genetics is there like a percentage you could give me on average
  this is 4channel not 4chan you can not post such images here
  not taking the bait
  its 100 genes  exercise or learning is a meme

what can humanity actively do to acheive immortality or at least amortality after fully understanding how the brain and the body works we could easily make replace one and one part until the whole human is cybernetic right    im studying to be an embedded systems engineer and i want to work with this    what should i read or research to further my knowledge on this thanks
  this is the thing scientists should be researching why even gather knowledge if youre not immortal
get more funding for sens
   after fully understanding how the brain and the body works  this is the biggest problem we dont understand this shit and these retards would rather spend their money on researching computer ai because muh omnipotent ai will cure all of dem diseases
  what can humanity actively do to acheive immortality  not die

  elon musk is the best
  this is my greatest fear going into uni for engineering this srping i have spent the past 8 months self teaching everything that has to do with differentiation and integration in a single variable and fundamentals of physics and chemistry i feel if i fail then i have no purpose and will resort to working a call center smoking insane amounts of weed and playing video games until my death
    stop being late  calc 1 b  calc 2 f  how
  your fear is not grounded on substantial factors   university is not for everyone and can be very stressful and unproductive as a platform to learn for many people and smoking weed and playing video games is pretty dope  so why not just do whatever is right for you instead of meeting some idealistic expectation  youre gonna die anyway so do whats right for you  that being said if you feel that its too much for you there are a million ways you could use your time for something you feel is valuable other than going to study in a university   im sorry if im giving you a lecture you didnt ask for but im in the same position atm and i really relate to what youre saying
  i did but i must have had a series of massive brain farts because at the time i was absolutely certain that all my logic was correct but nonetheless it was not

  he wants to be something other than explicitly human cattle anon if he fails and i share his fear going into biophysics myself and having to take much higher math than i ever expected in hs then he he and i are basically worth nothing more than what we would convert to as fertilizer     wisdom is i think an inborn trait as well which is rare in people who are not intelligent
   my ass off  i doubt that how many hours a day did you study and by study i dont mean checking your phone or opening up another tab every fifteen minutes
  its a meme in the strict sense anon
  if you can even construct a coherent sentence youre more intelligent than most of humanity youre only dumb relative to the smart people you keep comparing yourself to
  also this my study technique was dreadful at uni and it was only afterwards that i was able to admit this to myself you actually have to think in the language youre using op in your case maths that and do a fuckload of past papers i did virtually none and thought i could get by just studying the course materials if id used some initiative my average grade would be far higher and i wouldve graduated with a far better degree and not at the bottom of my year
  it must have been a laugh for the person marking your exam usually under 30 would be someone who choked and didnt attempt any answers a bunch of blank pages yours sounds like long detailed totally different to what you were supposed to do though like a book of schizo rambling maybe you are schizo lol

ouch review the exam and determine why it went so wrong for you try again someday
just woke up after passing out during an all nighter missed the test that i had been studying for
  oh dude i feel every ounce of your pain i literally had a a in computer science 101 and because i only set my phone alarm and it just decided on its own to not go off on my final exam i dropped to a c which was not c or better so i was forced to take it again i literally could have just written my name and made the difference between c and c i got the most drunk i have ever been in my life nearly blacked out on that day now i always set phone and separate battery/electric alarm so i will never be fucked oversleeping again i understand youre probably nearly plastered from day drinking to attempt to distract the pain try to take a break from the booze for at least an hour to sit and watch the sunset with a black and mild/weed to remind yourself there is more to life than grades
  checked
its okay anon none of that will matter in the long run everything will work out
why were you late to all of your classes and labs
  stem isnt human cattle  youre still just doing someone elses work for them unless you want to entrepreneur in which case you dont need a degree    the arts and leading your own research are unironically the only ways to not be human cattle
  just bee yourself 
  i design study methodology  i formulate hypothesis with my colleagues  i do experiments myself  i analyze the data  i come to conclusions with my colleagues  we publish study in peer reviewed journal and our peers commentate upon and cite our work which goes on to stimulate more research  how exactly is this like being told to doubletime it out of the produce freezer   entrepreneurs who are beholden to investors and market fluctuations  are obsequious and conspicuous consumer lifestyle fags  constant fear of inflation and consumer timidity or fury  peddling to basest human instincts to make something of themselves  fuck off faggot
  i thought i was gonna fail my last test and i got an 80 sucks to be you bro
  that sounds a whole lot like   leading your own research  also not all entrepreneurs take investors  also your study methodology research is not exactly high on the list of funding priority if shit goes south enough
google deepmind has made a massive advance in using artificial intelligence for protein folding prediction     they have won the casp13 protein folding competition
article here 
  it makes sense that machine learning approaches would work really well for molecular mechanics since its all just parametrization and choosing between a few annealing algorithms good for them i guess
on its first foray into the competition alphafold topped a table of 98 entrants predicting the most accurate structure for 25 out of 43 proteins compared with three out of 43 for the second placed team in the same category
  a time traveller would pick the winning numbers for the super lotto and vehemently deny the existence of time travel not go and take the measley one million dollar rand prize for the supernatural

  lotteries exist to catch time travellers
  boiii
  i think youve missed the point
  holy shit immortality when
  2024
  next year
  biologybros please explain to a brainlet how important this is
  protein folding is a really hard problem that gives us insight into what governs bodily processes applications include studying diseases like aids directly enough to help make a cure
  so if this works does that mean were all going to live a lot longer could we do something about aging or is it only good for rare diseases
  btfo honestly are the other people even trying
  not the proles but yeah
so are protons good
  proteins you brainlet theyre a different thing now go back to your sandbox
  whts the difference
    hes got you there man theyre the same thats why in star trek they called it a protien torpedo
  protein torpedo
  is a protein torpedo a sex thing
  here           its a photon torpedo idiots
  im pretty sure it was a poutine torpedo   it destroys ships with the power of cheese curds
  cool immortality in my lifetime

i see lots of people want exact definition of a vague idea that is being discussed i can see them in almost every thread     thread about consciousness   define consciousness    thread about intelligence   define intelligence    important thing is that we dont need to define something before we actually discuss about them think about dna or gene is there a exact definition about what dna is no can we define it now maybe we can but it is really hard to define it exactely same principle appends to almost every scientific terms     discuss
  dna is selfreplicating genetic material consisting of an arrangement of nucleotides   consciousness and intelligence are hard to define because theyre not tangible things theyre really concepts whereas dna is a physical substance  but youre really just describing the characteristics  isnt that a definition
define left and right
  better definitions lead to more meaningful discussions this should be obvious to you if youve ever studied math or one of the actual sciences
  a definition is just a global pointer to an ideal the definition dna is referencing the actual physical object dna    definitions for metaphysical objects are harder because they reference something that is not physical     it is important to have good definitions because it is important to know wether youre talking about the same thing

what is your personality /sci/        most people here have asked about your mbti personality  but this time the post wont be unscientific  well be using the big five model of personality which depends on the lexical hypothesis which has the following two postulates    those personality characteristics that are important to a group of people will eventually become a part of that groups language    collorary more important personality characteristics are more likely to be encoded into language as a single word       for support look here      for other ways to support the big five look up  costa jr p t  mccrae r r 1992 four ways five factors are basic personality and individual differences 136 653665    for an integrated model of the big five look here     for some criticisms look here     the big five only cover the dispositional traits of what a person is if you want a model that encompasses the whole human look here

  this is such a great test though its somewhat long youll have to wait op
  umm what is the link to the test
      its the official and most reliable version of the test
  sorry im a turbulent ne dom and i dont have the patience to complete your test
  someone had done this test but their comment is no longer here /  well i hope someone else will have the patience because its a fun test

  i get really weird results i dont trust this test
  op you are pretty based stimulated my interest with these articles
high extraversion  except for low excitement seeking   very low agreeableness  except for high cooperation   very high conscientiousness  except for low dutifulness  very low neuroticism  high openness  except for low emotionality    very good test i like how the big 5 are broken down further for every metric except neuroticism i had an outlier

  agreeableness 2 no fucking surprise there youve got the personality of a psychopath
  its called elite personality
  its called wanking to pictures of decapitated cats then berating your personal assistant to wind down for the night
  tldr because practically no one ever replies to these   very low extraversion   above average agreeableness   very low conscientiousness   very low neuroticism   low openness     long version  extraversion 1   friendliness 1   gregariousness 21   assertiveness 1   activity level 1   excitementseeking 4   cheerfulness 18    agreeableness 60   trust 79   morality 29   altruism 1   cooperation 72   modesty 99   sympathy 21    conscientiousness 3   selfefficacy 1   orderliness 92   dutifulness 1   achievementstriving 1   selfdiscipline 1   cautiousness 87    neuroticism 98   anxiety 88   anger 68   depression 98   selfconsciousness 98   immoderation 68   vulnerability 99    openness 32   imagination 50   artistic interests 50   emotionality 43   adventurousness 38   intellect 1 lol   liberalism 79    so yeah im a beta numale shutin who doesnt get shit done and is afraid of people being mean to me and if i cant get what i want then i throw a fit about it
  whoops that agreeableness score is just average my bad
  wow /sci/ is looking prettty dumb these days falling for the old tricks

  it means you would be terrible at jobs dealing with the public like sales aswell as jobs with high stress combined with your high openness and agreeableness this means that your ideal career would be teaching art classes to the babies and infants of rich people from san francisco if youre not a woman thn youre probably fucked
  damn youve literally got the personality of a hamsandwich
  in all seriousness your extremely high neuroticism and extremely low extraversion and neuroticism is pretty much the recipe for mental illness be careful bud
  low conscientiousness
  recipe for mental illness be careful bud  youre about 13 years too late 17 if you count tism    thats about right thankfully a ham sandwich can be halfway amusing once in a while but any other time nobody desires its presence

figure it out boys so we can speed this shit up
  duhh just remove the c and youre left with o2 how is that hard
does anyone know why we dont crisp some antiradiation genes into alge and shoot it over there
  lichen already survives in martian conditions  make it black so it absorbs light heats up the surface  melt the ice caps    good idea if youre playing the long game not a good idea for winning the competition unfortunately it seems they want a quick nonbio solution
  muh mars  we are never getting off this rock are we
now hear me out what if we did something like this  6co2  6h2o  e  c6h12o6  6o2
  did you just solve riemann
  just ship some and then constantly ship more for like 50 years till we get closer to sending a human there straight up one way parachute with 3000lbs of lichen     start a bidding war youll pay 40 mill max a launch unlimited launches lets some billionaire make more money just get a green mars
it wasnt just any old other molecules when i read about this they were demanding sugars
  melt the icecaps  before generating a magnetic field as radiation shield   breh
  how can we do this is this a nuke in the center of mars movie idea
  enzymes thats how its done earth
  you can have many sattelites in orbit which carry coils made out of superconducting material to generate very high fields but you might need very much of them you can limit the amount by having them orbit at an altitude where they remain at a position exactly between the sun and mars since the sun is the source of most of the radiation anyway
  like this
op makes a thread about a competition to turn co2 into carbohydrates    autists start talking about terraforming techniques      water may be pretty hard to find polar ice is practically useless unless there is water at the equator you wont have the energy you need
  fuck and here i am thinking co2 catalysis research was just a meme    there are plenty of catalysts that can be used to turn co2 into methanol for fuel pic related is the george olah plant in iceland they use some sort of patented heterogenous catalysis to convert co2 to meoh and dioxygen using electrolyticallyproduced hydrogen as a feedstock
  you could use nuclear fusion as energy to create new molecules on mars with the presence of raw elements have a concentrated nuke blast with raw metals around it terraforming technology is the answer
  poor konata  she is smol     
  energy is not the problem its about efficiently generating oxygen from existing molecules     co2 into o2 is best done through electrolysis suppose the co2 could be run through the water in the form of lime water then o2 could be strained through either a janus particle filter or the frequential mit water filter and the water itself could be recycled full proof
  how the fuck would you convert co2 into complex molecules like sugars without involving enzymes inorganic catalysts can do stuff like conversion of co2 to methanol and you can make acetic acid from co2 and methane i could imagine there might be some sort of system that could get you to glyceraldehyde but glucose i dont think anyone has ever even come close
  by first turning it into o2     o
  dude pyrolysis lmao
dig hole  put lid  put lamps  put nitrogen in filter it with temperature/pressure and add a teaspoon of co2  put water in melt it from ice outside  plant plants  plants breakdown co2 into o2 and some weird hydrocarbon material that might be useful    the contractors are boeing and lockheed martin and the cost estimates are very reasonable for such massive project for about a trillion a small scale demonstrator could be made in 50 years
  wait say that again
  melt the ice caps  all the water evaporates  gee thanks
  for about a trillion a small scale demonstrator could be made in 50 years  give me 30 billion and i will do it in 20
  ok anon check your bank account
  see      the starch they requested isnt made by plants iirc
  give me a link you fucking idiot i need to apply my 155 iq to simple chemistry
  are you retarded buddy
theres already ways nasa is literally asking a meme question basically equating to can we strip co2 like we do h2o help us were retarded    you can already use  literally any plant  gm yeast/other microbes  fluoride catalzation  neutron bombardment  im sure theres much more that i dont know off hand    what a disgusting question from an equally disgusting organization
    this could work youre an idiot though cause im stealing your idea
  it is relatively easy to turn co2 and water into various plastics and hydrocarbons just basic chemistry zubrin has been working on this stuff for years
  i think its stupid to get money for photosynthesis or electrolysis
  yes pretty much but its not clear to me how large a coil and how many you need to achieve this superconductors are fundamentally limited by critical temperature critical field and critical current critical temperature you get for free with most materials in space but field and current would limit how big you could make the field of the magneto shield
huh have they ever heard of photosynthesis lmao
  im sorry but all cost estimates provided to us by boeing and lockheed martin as well as independent experts have shown values greatly exceeding 30 billion  space is hard space is expensive we cannot waste the publics time and money chasing conman promises
    we cannot waste the publics time and money chasing conman promises    oh like every war ever people will buy into it easily
  because much of the scientific community goes apeshit at the idea of contamination of any kind a lot of papers that are to be written could be at stake if someone were to land something confirmed to carry microbes or similar and then you have the radical environmentalists
you may fool everyone else but not me nasa i wont be tricked into fixing global warming
only available to us citizens    good luck muritards
if you turned every co2 molecule on mars into oxygen the atmosphere would still not be breathable you need to add like 900millibars of nitrogen/oxygen to make it workable
just plant trees
just plant some trees lmao
  a big fucking monopole magnet in orbit
    dont be stupid trees would die on mars  we should give the trees some sort of oxygen mask so they dont die
  because theres an unknown active methane source on mars which suggests life is already there also based on the mass extinction in the atacama after it rained for the first time in 500 years any attempt to alter the environment would likely kill them all
  plant a tree  what do i win
      make an artificial tree and leave it there
while tradinotional logic can result in a value of either 1 or 0 true or false fuzzy logic can have produce the entire spectrum between 1 and 0 as its output is this still relevant in modern machine learning interested in this topic but dont know whether its worth it considering its quite an archaic math field
bump
youre better off learning about bayesian networks it accomplishes the same thing and its what everyone in machine learning uses nowadays
  muh bayes  fuck off transhumanist
  its relevant and covered in about 5mins in the first lecture  it doesnt take a genius to understand big output  likely
who writing putnam tomorrow
  right here anon
gonna spend 8 hours of my life tying my high score of 0

tfw obligated to write it this year because im taking a course with the putnam coach  i fucking hate contests

this thread is scientific because its about the singularity  this song is unironically the best song about the singularity and that guitar riff is really good      raise your head up its just one more step  are you giving up now so close to knowing  the only hope thats left has been taken from view    a new journey awaits you  time to begin  a new journey awaits you  no one will ever break us  join the experience  when you become ready  encounter certainty  you will have to witness  all of this on your own  you will find the reasons  not left to wonder why  every moment matters  new discovered space  a shift of time is on its way  together we will have to change  another hope is known to me  were gonna have to find our own beliefs    a new journey awaits you  time to begin  a new journey awaits you    looking up to a new idea  were we all can focus  a mystery thats deceived  a subtle thought has been noticed  of our ascension  of our ascension  the transition has come  enlightened and courageous  you know what you can become  our journey has just begun
  has the idea of mathematical beauty and appealing to brainlets like me lead the foundations of physics astray
  has anybody read her book  sounded quite interesting
  no but what do you big brained niggas think
  its a scientist vacuously denies that some philosophical concept everyone casually believes is hard science episode  this is so boring go back to under weinbergs desk
  weinberg  that film producer who honey dicked those actresses
    no but i attended a presentation she did to promote her book she makes a lot of good points so if you have the time its probably a pleasant read     shes a savage
  no le physics has no meaning man
fbump
while its true that there is no reason why all true theories have to be beautiful its also true that all theories which are known to be true are also beautiful
fuck science  fuck physicists
  i think the cranks on /sci/ will have a hard time deciding whether to disagree because shes a woman or agree because she hates string theory too
  it would be so hot to fuck a girl raw while she talks about mathematics
  go back to /g/
  sauce
  i read her book i liked it the interview with nina was classic the weinber interview was ok and lisi said some funny things polchinski obviously was missing a good chunk of his brain and i think her point about string theory/susy being dead but hobbling on in zombie mode thanks to mathfaggery is accurate but she has too depressing of an outlook i think we still might make actual discoveries at the lhc or even this new anita/icecube result is exciting plus the lhcb excesses are a hint of new physics so i disagree with her implicit physics is dead message though i agree that theorists are still caught up in the superstring meme
  nima not nina and weinberg not weinber
  lol
  literally never heard of any of this but i knew  that faggot (((weinberg))) was involved
  the only thing that leads physics astray is that these fuckers for some reason decided not to work mathematically precise and explicitely say when stuff is speculative on the math part and also their publication culture
you mathematicians i will never understand you when i look at any formula i dont see beauty i see a headache    i think people just get addicted to the dopamine rush of working it out    i still respect what you do    wtb mentat
  no u
  mentats were applied calculators the guild was into pure math hit the spice not the juice faggot
bump
why did he commit sudoku
bump
i guess no one knows i dont even know how he died
  bump ive been wondering this for a while couldnt find anything on it either
  its a puzzler
experiments have been conducted by several scientists which involve light and radio sources traveling at speeds well in excess of the speed of light   how much faster
  which experiments
  we dont know each time the faster than light signal goes back in time and stops the experiment from ever happening
     decade old popsci article written by arts graduate   imagine not understanding group velocity   abovetopsecret  time to go back anon  /x/  
  im not /x/ though you are
  is a tachyon a specific object or a category   perhaps a tachyon detecter could be constructed utilising time crystals modified to display an alteration in qualities could be inherently paradoxical   do any inanimate andor ambient spacetime andor non spacetime what is non spacetime phenomena phenomena produce tachyons in theory   ive heard rumour that some minds can send information backwards in time if the firmaments and filaments are of a cosmic mind  i wonder if it is imagining its own conception and potentially thus providing the information to before itself for itselfs existence and infogenesis    
  
  so this pics pattern similarities are simply due to mathematics physics complexity theory and emergence theory and considering the similarities may still not scale up to an equally or greater functional model
  fuck off
  do you know who the fuck you are
  no u
  cherenkov radiation literally exceeds the speed of light and it is always present in nuclear plants
  it doesnt exceed the speed of light in a vaccuum nothing can
  no u when you could yes u
redpill me  there are more than 118 elements
yes of course there are why do you even ask
  yeah theyre just really heavy and unstable
    the question you really wanted to ask is  is there a stable long lived element beyond 118    we really do not know
of course there are more you dumb fucking faggot
wtf how do you redpill someone on the periodic table what would a bluepill even be
  i guess you could say the realization of why the periodic table is you know periodic is kind of a redpill most highschool students cant explain this properly while most first year chemistry students not the brainlets can
115
  jumbonium
  unununium is the best element
  redpill me  gtfo pillpopping /pol/esmoker
      cant wait for unobtainium in my lifetime
      what unscientific opinions        im happy that the table is complete at long last with proper names but unununium was always a favorite stopgapname from high schol days
  why are you so insecure
why dont i have a fucking job    is x a meme major  unless it is biomedical mechatronics or systems engineering your major xe major is not a meme additional meme majors include chemical and nuclear engineers they are challenging degrees but there are just not enough jobs to keep up with graduating students many bitter anons in these threads are cheme students or unemployed cheme graduates    why is mechatronics or bio engineering a meme degree  they are often very shallow degrees at the undergraduate level students end up becoming a master of none and are outclassed by the more common disciplines for the longest period of time these courses were only master/phd opportunities a good undergraduate program is very rare for either discipline your meme state school isnt one of those programs    i cant find a job  what is your gpa what is your experience is your resume shit do you interview well when did you start looking  gpa  a gpa of 30 is the bare minimum for most companies  experience   experience is helpful but is not needed to get a job you will have a much tougher time though and will need to grind out applications college clubs and personal projects are good ways to get at least some experience if it is not professional experience  resume  post your resume if you want it to be reviewed try and quantify actions at your job dont just list your responsibilities if you have no professional experience emphasize your school projects/clubs/personal projects  interviewing  it helps to practice and write down your answers to question that you think you will be asked using glassdoors can be helpful when trying to figure out what kind of questions specific companies ask  candidate  you dont need to be a 39 gpa 3 internship non white student to get a job in engineering just keep in mind apple/boeing/broadcom/google/intel/etc dont generally hire 30 gpa no experience autists that are incapable of talking to other human beings
  he didnt major in ece
i have a bsee i am currently in grad school because the only job i was able to find was one as a coffee barista i get paid more than the average barista though so its kind of cool
so im making 50k with benefits as a mechanical engineer 3 years of experience     when do i buy house real estate is expensiveis a crash coming
has anyone here used the the common application site to apply to a university
came across a zoomer classmate in a homemade porn video
  cant remember it well but yeah why
  how did that make you feel
  did you bother with sending your transcripts to the common app processing center or did you just send them directly to the school
  what state are you in  in b4 california
  if i have a meme major biomedical eng do i have to sell that i have changed my ways and am excited for an outside my major job to actually be employed
dude who studied meche at uni of manchester are you here
  my school had us submit a form to our counselor of what schools we were applying to and from there the counselor would send the transcripts out to each
is bme all that bad biomedical engineering i want to become a doctor and bme seems like the best route but i also want to be financially stable 6 figures excuse my autism
  hello darkness my old friend
  not much yet as long as i dont make eye contact from now on
low gpa 30 noname college for meche  just got my degree now what  is it possible to still make big bucks or did i fuck myself over
  that image  right in the feels
  2019 recession
  biomedical engineering is not a meme
  move to a city where you can get a higher paying job and then buy a condo do that for another 5 years and then maybe youll have enough equity to flip into a starter home or keep it as a rental if your froggy stay in that house for another 5 maybe fix it up a bit sell that and you can finally have a decent house in a nice place to live     alternatively sock money away like a miserly faggot for a few more years and downgrade your job to go live in some midwest shit hole where houses cost less than a toyota
  50000 annually 3 years in lmao
engineering really isnt worth it is it    what should i major in instead high school senior btw
  philosophy
  finance    1 its easy    2 you make more money than engineers especially if you get a job on wall street    3 job security    4 youre much more likely to encounter hot chicks in your classes     engineering is no longer a great career that offers promises plenty of engineering jobs are being filled by foreigners and wages are going down because the market is oversaturated
  what about maths then an mba at a top school
any brits with a 22 here  how long until you give up the search and kill yourselves
  got a better route to becoming a doctor  becoming a doctor
ironic how op cant find a job and yet the op copypasta still gives boomertier meme job advice i tried to warn you bros
  is this kinda like math or economics degree freshman engineering here just still considering possible alternatives
ee degree  just accepted a software engineering role after a few months of job searching  havent seriously programmed anything for over a year  hhopefully i get back in the groove quickly once im working
be me  have an engineering degree  a few years after graduating i finally am doing well in graduate job interviews  have interviews in commercial role at large company a civil service role another slightly more technical civil service role and a strategy consultant role  have job interview as well for an engineering role that matches my degree at a large nuclear employer    the engineering job is in the middle of nowhere while the others are all in london it pays the least i have no idea what sort of progression is possible or the timescales     i always thought that id go in to a technical career do i need to accept that in a service and financial services focused country going in to stem is career suicide
    at least you found a technical job i have an ee degree and im working as a coffee barista     currently in grad school to help improve my job prospects
  i basically found its next to impossible to get an actual ee job with only a bachelors if you didnt intern or do significant research/club work after graduating this job isnt remotely related to ee
  significant research/club work at school i meant to say i know a guy who didnt intern but worked on this space satellite thing at my school and got a job at spacex
    ee graduate here my grades were low but still enough to get a job with herculean effort ive had some interviews for decent roles if you can get to interview stage you always have a shot
what cs electives should i take to improve my chances of finding a job after graduating should i concentrate in cybersecurity
  im in the usa by the way
  cs  
just got a phone screen interview for a job in georgia im in another state so ill have to move if i get it the recruiter for the job asked me what my expected salary is i told her i cant give a solid figure right now because ill have to research the cost of living in georgia for that area and it will also depend on other factors such as what responsibilities ill have benefits promotion potential etc but as a minimum id accept 50000 a year    she replied saying 50000 is fine and then set up the phone interview if i get the job are they just gonna offer me 50000 or will they give me a chance to negotiate a higher wage 50k is shit but i need a job badly so i didnt want to say too much higher and get rejected on the spot    the job title is facilities systems engineer its an entry level engineering position
just had first internship this summer and wondering how to add it to resume should i add the name of the product i worked on or be generic and just say product instead also barely did anything at the internship
  facilities systems engineer  thats what we call our janitors here
mech undergrads ww    how you guys doing
anyone in here ever gotten a security clearance before im currently working on one for a job
wtf i didnt do a lot of work in a class and now im failing
  yeah lad
so for my internship resume i have education work experience projects and skills sections what order should i place them currently have  education  work experience  projects  skills
  skills and education are interchangeable  projects and work experience are interchangeable  but those two must come after the first two
  you forgot to add that youre a dumb faggot asking for career advice on 4chan
  bitchin how long did it take you for the clearance to clear
  i had to get a ts so it took like a year
  i dont think that should go on the resume  seems more apt for the interview
only have mowing lawns as work experience fml
  botanical maintenance using applied mechanics project 20142017  interfaced with the client to agree on reasonable specifications  utilized heavy machinery to take care of and properly maintain large scale botanical gardens  renovated the botanical garden in a timecost efficient manner and successfully met the clients specifications
  epic
  anyone have an idea what to expect here will i be able to negotiate for a higher wage
  it was on a golf course and i only got it due to my uncle
  how i do learn to bullshit like this
  you just did
  use words that you usually see in a papers abstract or title ie construct a near meaningless sentence that boils down to analyzed something but dont be wordybut dont be so sort that you cut off words that sound good or important  be as vague as possible  if the definition of some engineering word has even a partial reference to whatever it is youre describing use it in place no matter how big of a stretch it is  vague words have no measure large is relative thats why i said large garden lawn mowers count as heavy machinery
  botanical maintenance technician in charge of x acres of manicured property  operated and maintained x lawn care equipment  interfaced with clients to resolve scope of work issues and negotiate change orders buzzwords    those are free /engi/
any fellow boomer doing /metallurgy/ here
  nah man im /oil and gas/
  is 22 too old to essentially just be starting in engineering let me know before i waste money
is cs a meme degree im currently pursuing it 
  no its not youll get hired and youre basically going to become a magician since everything is technology now a days and youll not only know how everything works but theoretically be able to construct anything yourself youre going to be an engineer after all but with technology/computers an app you can do it a website you can do it a computer game you can do it your own homemade router you can do it you name it if it has code you can do it
  tthanks for the reassurance
i never thought matlab could be this useful now fit curves and graphs are easy as hell to create i regret not learning it sooner
  cs gets a bad wrap because of a few types of people  people that just wanted to make videogames  people that cant handle maths not even the high iq stuff just single var calculus and matrix algebra  low iq people that cant handle abstraction iq100 required to understand assignment iq110 to understand object oriented and iq120 to understand parallel  thirdworlders who are so desperate for money that they forgo their morals  just dont be one of those people
  now learn to do it with python and excel so that you dont have to justify an expensive piece of software to your boss when you eventually get a job
  based
  oh shit  i unironically joined to be a gayme dev
  i tried python but its way more difficult to do things is there something like the curve fitting tool for python
  you forgot about the trannies
programming or networking 
i dont have a job check my taxes ill post them in about 5 weeks   no pay  no job    whoever says i have a job is a liar whoever says i am their employee is a liar whoever says they are my boss is a liar and an infamous heretic
  will i be able to negotiate for a higher wage  nope welcome to engineering
tfw still no job offers
question about gpa what do you put on the resume cumulative what you had in your last college  my first college i think i was at 2728  my current college im at 34  when i transfer to a uni next semester ill start fresh and will try to stay above 35
do you guys think companies would rather hire nonwhites over whites  i know colleges are biased like this i know a bunch of mexicans who went to uc but then dropped out to go to cc because it was too hard
  you fucked up
  i cant pass precalculus should i just kill myself
  the highest      companies prefer whites and people who look like whites  t still unemployed nonwhite with white friends who are all employed
  cheat through pre calc to calc 2  literally didnt learn shit  get an a in calc 3 and differential equations by actually trying  calculus is easy as fuck literally git gud
how tf do i move to a confy outdoors us state from the uk hdjsoawoowoe did i shoot myself in the foot by doing me 
  the only good states are california texas washington new york and maybe florida  considering youre in this thread youd probably want to move to ca or tx
  you have bad taste    t washingtonian
  california and thats it
  lol fucking looser    youre me when im older  yeah i am  thats so cool  nah whats cool is you i lose you along the way on my adventures
  sup
    california   expensive af real estate  nogunz  drought  highest state income tax  highest sales tax  high unemployment  tons of homeless people  tons of illegals  cities are complete shitholes
  dont major in finance lmao watch martin shkrelis finance tutorials if youre serious     do what youre passionate about in a way that can be applied to the market for the big bucks
    dweebs only fucking dweebs can pass that shit
  so many bits of bad advice all rolled up into one big shit sandwich
  no my aunt did it at 35 with 2 kids with a 2 hour commute
  i should have clarified that i mean being in college i only have my geneds out of the way right now
  what the fuck do you seriously expect to do in finance     are you going to analyze companies to predict winners and fill out excel spread sheets all day and pull up 100s of 10k and 10q documents every day what makes you even think youd be good at investing money most people cant beat the market
  idk bro im in college too quite subjective aint it    your resume and experience should matter more than age to an extent
  oh el oh
does anyone know a rigorous guide to studying im just bumblefucking around but managing i want to improve myself however
  just do it
  i can tell you browse 4chan a lot  
  that doesnt answer my question
  those only account for 1 of california
  you are an idiot go in the corner and think about what you have done
  programming exam  look at this example code and create a subclass implementing insert integration method  no fucking example code  oops sorry we forgot to include the example code just pretend its there    i swear to go if i fail this exam just because i had to make a subclass for a class that i had no info on at all
what are the most useful speaking languages to know german french
  oops sorry i forgot to include a correct answer just pretend its there
  brilliant rebuttal    yeah the cities where everyone lives  norcal is pretty beautiful
  why is system eng a meme degree im in industrial which is close if not same
  because it is not its just op likes to shove elongated objects up his ass
since this seems to be a thinly veiled jobs thread i guess ill post this here    what is the longest employment gap that wont cause suspicion among hiring managers ive been at my current job for almost 2 and a half years i fucking hate it and want to leave as soon as possible however even though its technically related to my degree computer engineering the job is embedded software eng nothing ive learned here is relevant to anything outside of this company except maybe learning how to properly use git since its all very ancient niche tools with the worst practices possible so i basically have 25 years of useless experience    my plan is to quit immediately spend some time learning some actual skills in a related field i was thinking of either going deeper into the embedded space and learning linux drivers and shit like that or going into a sysadmin/dba type job and then start applying so i have the strongest chances of getting a job what is the longest amount of time off i can reasonably take im worried that too long of a gap it will be a problem especially because i already have an employment gap of 1 year between my current job and graduating from college and they might see it as a pattern that raises red flags    im not worried about being unemployed while job hunting affecting my potential salary since pretty much anything would be a significant raise over what im getting now i just want to get out of here as soon as possible also please dont tell me to learn skills and apply for jobs while working at my current one maybe im just too much of a lazy degenerate but ive tried that multiple times over the past couple years and i just cant do it im just too drained at the end of the day
  get something lined up before jumping ship the job market is very rough right now
  fuck then why do i keep hearing about the unemployment rate being at an all time low and employers who are desperate for anyone is this only in some fields or is it a ruse
  unemployment is low if youre willing to work for less than minimum wage
would an energy or oil n gas company hire an aeroe
  no but they would definitely hire a meche looks like you memed yourself fool
  an ae can do most the stuff a me can do though
  youre retarded but 50k isnt terrible entry level in ga all being said certainly wont be raking it in and housing is rising but i live on quite a bit less in comfort
  except know how to properly formulate a question apparently
  u mad     im a high school senior fyi
  u mad  my bad didnt realize you were retarded
    a shot in the dark but now that i think of it if you take the job and are still in the thread i might be able to hook you up with a cheap room in my home itd be month to month since youre a literally who and its near enough to atlanta easy way to jump off to yer own place with less stress     feel free to reply with a fake email i made this one up just for shit like this    quadchanneler1gmailcom
  lol he mad
hello my fellow engineers  i need to pick a total of 4 electives will choosing 4 in a specific area make me more desirable as a job applicant i want to take applied wave propogation and maybe advanced analog ic basically im interested in waves or applications that involve sound   if choosing one specific area will make me more desirable what sources should i look at that would tell me what is more area is more in demand for jobs
  t retard
how fucked am i if im majoring in ee but i hate coding however that might be the cause ive never coded before college and they start us with c
what is the most comfy discipline which isnt entirely oversaturated and isnt soul crushing can be science related
  im not even the guy youre talking to i just want to know why the fuck you would even waste your time typing that shit out
  you can learn to like anything dont let one bad experience close your mind
  what a loser lmao
  i really doubt 4 shitty undergrad classes will make a lot of difference for a job i would pick the ones i find most interesting or useful
  cheme student  i applied to as many places as i possibly could for internship or coop  no one took me  i bought into the meme that i could go into industry pay off my loans then go to grad school and do research on fuel alternatives  bought into the meme that i could do research and do my part to make the world a better tomorrow    i fucking knew i should of jumped ship to compsci i fucking hate programming but atleast i would have been able to easily find a job i would of been able to make a decent living and get a wife and start a family but theres no fucking hope of that now now im overburdened with debt with nothing to show for it probably just going to off myself
  most ees are shit at coding best thing is to go into a field of ee where coding is not very important
how in the fuck do you get an internship this is such horseshit
  walk up to the internship factory ask to speak to the manager give him a firm handshake and the rest is history
  easy you just cut off your testicles and offer them to the engineering gods in hopes they take mercy on you and give you a internship
  for me actually getting an engineering job its more like    so you dont live in poverty  you actually found a girl  your job is good and intellectually challenging    young me would be very happy but then im a software engineer    in b4 not real engineering
  i know youre memeing but this is actually good advice if you are a woman on engineering you are just about guaranteed a job in the graduating class before me there was this real fuckhead who got a job at nasa even though she didnt know shit about engineering or have any projects to show something similar happened with the women in my graduating class where all the guys got shitty/no jobs
so do you guys get laid at uni     or are you too busy studying
  or are you too busy studying  uh yyeah thats the reason
pi meters  10 feet
  how the fuck do you even get laid the girls these days seem so indifferent towards this whole thing if fucking disgusts me all they do now is just sit on tinder and waiting on some fuckbois to swipe right so they could get an instant bump to their already selfcentered egos plus add up all the shit from recent rape accusation plague around the country and its absolutely not worth it
    here is just one out of hundreds of thousands of them    
      just go up and talk to them and just be yourself lmao its not complicated
  1 cut out the vidya and go to the gym every other day except when its exam season    2 spend time actively trying to socialize with grills and using tinder the more you level up your charisma the better yours odds
  computer scientist cant build shit its not computer engineering all youll know how to be is a programmer not even technology either basically a code monkey
  should of  this is why nobody wants to hire you
so i dont have any real skills other than basic matlab and solving electrical circuits im hoping to learn more my junior year where everything is upper division ee courses   are there ever any summer internship openings towards the end of summer or are all the summer applications only available around this time
  how is petroleum engineering for a degree vs mechanical engineering
  go code monkey go
word to the wise to all you code monkeys out there
  i hope you dont actually believe this
  from what i understand petroleum engineering is a volatile field meaning some of the time everybody with a degree has a job and the rest of the time nobody even experienced engineers can find a job
should i quit my job as a lab tech at an engineering firm in order to actually start on college properly or is it better to keep racking up experience
  depends how old are you what kind of firm do you work at what kind of engineering do want to do do you have a degree already how long have you been working there
  is the nuclear company sellafileld or magnox    sellafield used to be amazingly high pay  on par with finance however this has changed and they have cut pay to be in line with the average in the north of england so youre best avoiding it
  im 19 and they specialize in high speed connectors i dont have any sort of degree and ive been working here since out of high school i also want to do ee so it lines up with what i want to do
apply for jobs for 10 months  nothing most applications are ignored and the few times i get a response its a generic rejection that doesnt give a reason  suddenly november  three companies invite me to interviews all three offer me the job all three offer better salary and conditions than i hoped for    what the fuck
  perhaps we could add a section on the fundamentals of engineering exam to the op along with a link to the website
  im in the same position  companies like ups will hear lots of extra workers at peak and really care about your rep with them my hr manager started as a driver if youre loyal you can easily transfer from driver helper to engineer if they like you
  whatever interests you that you can become the best at
  im sorry i forgot the preferred term is electrical engineer or software engineer
just finished my electrical engineering bachelor am i a retard for persuing the embedded systems master basically choice of ee and cs courses instead of just purely an electrical engineering master
  yes
  take whatever you find interesting
  right here my scro  how you guys doing  probably not as bad as the chemes but it really sucks not knowing a coding language besides matlab
  education and work first  gpa never ever unless really good  related projects after if you still have room include a very small skills section that summarizes what you used in the work section discuss the source of your skills extensively
  this is no bullshit the correct answer
  well dont tell them that part you jackass  youre here to showcase the value of your work never show weakness unless asked
  hiring happens in waves it doesnt stop after uni
  electrical engineer here with several biomedeng friends it is a meme 1 has found a job 3 are still looking im making 6figs
  bioeng will likely be a great field to get into in like 2040 years its just too early atm
    unlikely youre better off specializing in one of the areas that biomedical engineering tries to mishmash together mechanical engineering electrical engineering neuroscience computer science materials engineering    biomedical tries to be a shitty version of all of them you cant shove an entire team into one person i wish it was possible since i hate people but its not
  why is chemical engineering a meme
    top 10 gpa willl find a job on a factory manager track most likely the rest will go to starbucks
  why
  unlike other types of engineering there is no way to gain experience without an internship or doing some type of research involving heavy machinery without any experience you wont get a job unless your gpa is incredible or know someone who already has a job
  good embedded system jobs usually require a master
  its not a meme its just a hard field to get into     1its one of the most difficult engineering majors there is    2 its a small field with not alot of growth so the  of grads   of jobs available    3 its a very specialized eng field so you better fucking like what youre doing because you arent gonna be able to change into new industries as easily as meche     4 what  said i found that most of my peers werent able to get internships their sophomore years except for a select few this meant that you only had one year one fucking chance to get an internship your junior year otherwise youve essentially just reduced your hireability by 2550 when you start trying to apply during your senior year    5 if you are lucky and do get a job offer chances are you will have to move 1000 miles away to a rural area where you dont know anyone there are some jobs in metro  urban areas or at least within driving distance of those but literally everyone is trying to get those jobs i wanted to stay in socal because i was raised there my family/friends are there and my gf was there but nope i was having to compete against massive schools like stanford all the ucs usc etc the only fucking job offer i got was out in the middle of fuck nowhere idaho     6 some office jobs exist where you get to sit around and design reactors or even get to play in a lab all day but most people will end up being shoeholed in a processing plant for their entire career some people may like this but i sure as fuck dont     all those reasons aside there are still plenty of people who go on to have amazing careers its just these people are outnumbered by the people who get fucked
      thanks guys
    or octave
hey guys cc student looking to transfer into a competitive biology program  i have near straightas two cs and one b out of about sixteen classes is that enough for my application not to go straight into the trash at an ivy league school
choose my specialization /eng/ i have to submit tonight need to rank top 5 options and spaces available are   biomedical engineering 35  chemical and materials engineering 85  civil engineering 280  computer systems engineering  80  electrical and electronic engineering 100  engineering science 70  mechanical engineering 125  mechatronics engineering 100  software engineering 100  left it to last minute and dont have enough time to do research
  thats something to talk to your advisors about because youll actually need a plan of attack if you want to get into schools like that
  holy fuck dude do you really have no idea out of all those options what youd be interested in
  i dont even understand how someone could be interested in them
  i dont even understand how someone could be interested in them  if you actually go into engineering man you are going to fucking hate your life lol have fun
why hasnt anyone bombed the msc software offices yet
  let me explain the next 26 years of your life  youll choose an engineering discipline based solely on how much money you could potentially make if you werent a fuck up youll then spend your freshman year and the first semester of your sophomore year telling every single person you talk to how great itll be when youre a millionaire in a few years with a huge house and several expensive cars as well as larping to students in other disciplines about how much harder your bullshit classes are harder than theirs after failing sophomore mechanics twice youll finally give in and change your major to business halfway through the semester while spending the rest of the semester telling everybody how having a midcareer salary of 50k isnt so bad youll almost certainly try to feel superior about your failed life choices by explaining to the nonfailure engineering majors how you wont need to work so hard in school now/fail repeatedly like you already have/take your work home with you when you get a job etc     or you could just choose to major in something youre interested in and not hate your life
  okay kid if you dont want to find a job then thats your problem
  im second year ee student and already have a job as an intern with decent enough payment for a student how can you fuck up so bad that you cant find a job with ee degree anon where do you live
i cheated on most of the assignments for first year and now half of second year uni by copying excel sheets mostly doing a bachelors in mecheng btw the only problem is that i havent learned jack shit i did average in the exams but i dont understand anything i go to all the lectures but its just chinks reading powerpoints also ive noticed im more interested in computing than whatever the fuck im doing at the minute but its too late to change 15 years in is there a way to develop an interest in a subject i hate and if not what should i do if kms whats the most painless way to go in the uk with noguns
  its too late to change 15 years in  but thats wrong
  unless youve already spent tens of thousands on living expenses and tuition       just roll with it until the end and find a career doing computing
  at the end of first year i could have changed to aerospace or product design i dont think i could have just jumped to cs or software engineering maybe its just a phase anyway my brain is cooked after a year and a half of drinking and lack of mental work all im really good for now is becoming a fucking asbestos welder at backbreaking inc goddamn it i cant see what the fuck im supposed to be doing anymore
  you sound like youre just about completely useless you should definitely dropout
  what did he mean by this
  so basically you need to go to an ivy league school and get a 40 to even get a job    maybe if you are a scientist engineer or doctor but the majority of college educated people obviously werent in the top 10 and most them are doing fine theyre not making it rain but they are putting food on the table and they have table to put in on
the top pay for a senior software engineer here in nz is 85k usd what do i do
cheme student here planning to change majors i only mildly like the material and i have no desire to live in a place like midlands texas should i go cpt sci or soft eng
  either way its off off to  with you my friend enjoy the obligatory 10 year old thinkpad with gentoo or whatever else they manage to shill you
  4chan 2018
  that place scares me those are a different breed of people that should be ostracized from society
got a job interview tomorrow lads been jobless 2 years since i graduated im scared they will ask what have you done these last 2 years you havent had a job    wish me luck bros
  whats your degree
  that shit boring you have to put pussy on the pedestal and pretend like partys and women are magic theyre not
  when you live by the cheat you have to die by the cheat
pe exam results out sometime this week  frantically hitting f5 on ncees website    its maddening
  mechanical engineering i think i did really well in the interview i researched the company and had a lot to say about them and they kept responding to my answers with good answer i liked that and they just generally sounded impressed with what i knew
im pretty sure cheme are either autists or drugaddicts
  giving them a number  you done goofed youre probably in the system as having accepted 50k
  damn how did you get the job as a high school grad
should i go for cs major
  chemes are either chads chasing the dream of making 100k day one of graduation at a company like bp or are autists     i wish i never fell in love with chemistry both cheme and chem are awful majors and i would have been better off doing meche or softwaree
is pursuing a masters/phd in ee worth it
ok /sci/ so i just did a prescreening test which was pretty easy but i fucked one of the questions up i say it was pretty easy despite my fuckup bc im 99 certain i know what i did wrong after the fact ending test screen said i got an 88 guy i talked to on the phone before the test said id get an email saying congrats well think about hiring you or jeez buddy youre a retard after i took the test have not received either of these notifications so rather than wait for them im asking a mongolian basketweaving forum to speculate on my chances because i need validation and also a job long story short    am i fucked or will one mistake on a question be looked over if i got the rest of the problem correct
  no a cs degree is only useful for code monkeying and you dont need to major in anything to do that
  howd you do on the personality test in my experience even if i do well they tell me no because i dont meet company culture also what company id like to know a company that tells me how well i did afterwards
  didnt give me a personality test yet it was more like a prescreen to see if i was an idiot and then ill get an interview if they decide im not an idiot company is sterling medical devices
how retarded would it be to go study music on uni after 4 years of actively studying computers ee operation systems servers and networking at school im really confused anons
  masters yes phd only if you want the careers that require it      do you like music a lot more than all that and also more than having money
  cheme only appeals to women or people without a conscience
  what kind of careers require a phd in ee
  do you like music a lot more than all that and also more than having money  i guess i found the answer on my question its more like i keep seeing the mental damage that cs field has done to my teachers that is what scares me the most
  teaching/researching ee at a university      i keep seeing the mental damage that cs field has done to my teachers  youll have to be a little more specific theres a few things that sounds like
  then what the fuck should i go for that can lend me a good paying job
  why is this shitposted i feel like its libtards defending themselves against any self respecting stem student
  wait till you get physical damage from your instrument and mental anguish for not playing 1/64 time
  i went to an electronics course at a vocational school during high school i really just got lucky
  computer engineering
  could you go deeper into this im choosing between me ee cs and compe with a concentration in robotics and trying to figure out the best option before i make myself a debt slave again
  dont believe him man ce ends up just being cs with less opportunities and lower pay  t not in either of them
  and yet they make more money than ees ever will
  its about the same in terms of job opportunities the difference depends on what you want to do code monkey or a fucker that actually designs and build computer hardware and software
  a fucker that actually designs and build computer hardware and software    most ce majors dont end up doing interesting stuff like that also all the smart cs majors i knew in college are doing way more interesting stuff like research in protein folding    t ce major doing excel monkey work
sad day today the company i work at is laying off half of the engineers because were having foreign companies do their work for much cheaper
  im a ce and i do interesting shit its your fault that you arent if he wants to he can
engineering physics major here     i need to pick some engineering electives and i was thinking about machine design are machine design labs in solidworks fun stupid question but is it kind of like building legos on the computer
  untrue a ce can easily get a cs job the reverse is not true    for example embedded systems is a completely different animal than it jobs literally everyone i know who did cs is now doing it since it requires more engineering skills because of the need to know both hardware and software engineering
  mat sci ugrad  can take differential geometry  can take advanced engineering mathematics  which one bros
  as a texan i must say that this is a horrible opinion nuke this fucking state
    youll have a lot more jobs with an ee degree over a ce degree    computer engineers are just retards that cant handle the hard ee classes like electromagnetism or control systems
  what kind of questions did they ask you and how did you prepare
  youll have a lot more jobs with an ee degree over a ce degree  and someone who did ce would not want those jobs because they are not ce jobs  computer engineers are just retards that cant handle the hard ee classes like electromagnetism or control systems  and youre a retard if you cannot understand why someone who knows they want to do ce would choose to take extra ce classes instead of classes like em and power systems that will be virtually useless to them meanwhile tons of ees end up going into ee and cant code for shit understand oss babbys first computer architecture or even basics of a fucking command line cause they were taking those classes instead
  meanwhile tons of ees end up going into ee  should have said  meanwhile tons of ees end up going into ce
  how interesting a job depends on what you find interesting lmao gtfo of here
  i think it depends on the person i absolutely hate computer architecture and systemverilog and found it more difficult because i had to put in more focus and effort my ee courses were more interesting and therefore less hard
  youll have a lot more jobs with an ee degree  yeah bro i cant wait to have 10 jobs one is totally not enough fucking retard if youre worth half a shit youll find a job with either of those degrees no problem
  and someone who did ce would not want those jobs because they are not ce jobs  nope not true we have tons of computer engineers at my company with ee degrees
  meanwhile tons of ees end up going into ee and cant code for shit understand oss babbys first computer architecture or even basics of a fucking command line cause they were taking those classes instead  thats all easy shit any ee can learn
  obviously he meant job opportunities brainlet
  computer engineers are just retards that cant handle the hard ee classes like electromagnetism  yep this is true at my school most of the ee majors who failed or dropped emag switched to computer engineering
  you seem to have poor reading comprehension but since you didnt say anything nasty ill break it down for you nicely someone with an ee degree is not someone who did ce those are someone who did ee and if they knew from the start they would end up doing ce it would have made more sense for them to do a ce major and take more relevant classes      except they never do and end up being shit ces and yeah it is easy which is why i used it as an example to demonstrate how they cant even bother to learn the most basic introductory ce material let alone harder topics well to be fair some of them can and do but im generalizing like i think we all are here      and obviously i understood that the point is that if there are 1000 or 100 job opportunities you should have no problem getting 1 either way if you dont suck and there are always less people qualified for areas where there are less opportunities just like software vs hardware      those type of students dont end up working as actual engineers regardless
  how did you read that comment completely backwards
  if youre smart do me if youre average do ee if youre retarded do cs or compe
  have fun with your hvac career
  im having fun working on jet engines
why is there no respect among different engineering disciplines theyre all completely different and not even comparable
  its /sci/ many here are arrogant assholes because either they are projecting failures or they are autists whose perceived intelligence is their only redeeming quality and thus feel a strong need to defend it above others in real life everyone i work with from various disciplines respects each other cause we arent failures or autists
  and i work on spacecraft i guess im a retard though
  a bigger question is why are engineers posting in /sci/ you are not scientists    post this shit in /diy/
  /sci/ is a math and science board engineers are applied mathematicians
  youre retarded
  hes also in highschool
  id guess hes an undergrad like most here
  engineers are applied mathematicians  so are financial analysts it doesnt mean they should be posting here    fuck off to /diy/ please
  yes they actually should financial math threads would be entirely on topic anyway the fact that you think /diy/ would be more applicable to engineering just shows that you have no idea what engineering is like really /g/ should be more of an engineering board but that place is full of consumer electronics obsessed neets and plebs with a certs
they asked me questions about how i approach starting a new project how i approach dealing with customers what i knew about the company things like that    they really liked my answer about what i knew about the company all i did was go to their about page and memorize a few facts about them and what kind of products and customers they deal with i basically recited it back but they were impressed by it     there was a line about something about a green sustainability program in the job posting so i looked that up again memorized some facts about it and then when they brought it up in the interview i mentioned i am very passionate about the environment and working at a company that is environmentally conscious and performing work to cut down on waste and improve efficiency for that program would be something i would take pride in    really cheesy shit but they seemed to eat it up mentioned they really appreciated that i took the time to research that bit and went on about how important it is to them and their customers
job apply online  fail to submit online interview  get called in for an interview at that company but for a role i didnt apply to  stuttering mess in the interview  they offer me job  huh    speaking with another guy who started on the same team at the same time he both applied directly and had to do an online interview
  calculus  linear algebra  stats  i dont see why they wouldnt be able to post on a math board
  t highschool math major  dont become a walking 4chan now i know how impressionable you youngsters can be
  they really liked my answer about what i knew about the company all i did was go to their about page and memorize a few facts about them and what kind of products and customers they deal with i basically recited it back but they were impressed by it  this always works cause so many idiots come in blind it makes them look dumb and desperate like theyd take any job even if they know nothing about it      because of this 
has anyone done the unilever game tests
  it depends bro when i transferred from cc to uni i went in wanting to be ee and that was what i was accepted as now that im one semester away from finishing my degree i kinda regret not going into ce all my electives are ce related and it took me until i was done with my junior year classes to realize that i enjoy coding embedded systems etc more than plain electrical engineering stuff dont take me wrong communication systems is interesting but i could have just taken this as an elective not a required course and focused more on the programming and design aspect in ce meh if i land a ce job its very likely i will have to teach myself some things i missed out on during undergrad
  ok so i just did it with a fake resume and fake account it seems ok with practice but the last part about reading the faces gets me thankfully i have a normie sister
  this is what i keep trying to explain to people you should still be fine though good luck
is it a good idea to copy paste the job tasks and requirements in my cover letter
i wish i didnt have a job
senior year  literally everything is fucking group work  due on monday means posting rough analysis on sunday night for chinamen class mates  literally all non chings are complaining to professor  he cant do shit about it  tfw 2 more quarters of this shit  fucking kill me
    honestly dont be a fucking autist and have a willingness to move/travel there are some faggots in my year that dont want to move out of the zip code those are the retards you see bitching online
  is this true for all engies    shieeeet im willing to move cross country or out of country for a good paying job when i graduate
the only thing shittier than engineering is the tons of delusional college freshman that go into it and think they will be making 100k a year designing space robots
  no you dont
if you had to choose how to allot your time would you rather work your ass off to learn difficult theory to get smarter or work on stuff that directly leads to publishing highimpact papers
both
  youve obviously never published a paper of your own  what is even the point of this thread what the fuck is up with abysmally low quality but seemingly genuine threads in /sci/ these days
  what the fuck is up with abysmally low quality but seemingly genuine threads in /sci/ these days  maybe you should do a study about it
  implying these are mutually exclusive  implying you couldnt learn difficult theory if someone hadnt written a paper to teach you about it      remember nature is 4chans enemy now after publishing a paper in support of multiple genders and another paper debunking allele frequency analysis
interesting article      pic unrelated wave reactor for gmo moss to produce human proteins or something looks cool
  so theres some grey goo potential here because they have made something that could have more efficient photosynthesis pretty neat way to make proteins though
is this a scientifically accurate ranking
bernoulli low tier  ramanujan based tier  grothendieck based tier  tao on this list at all
  you can tell from the way they dress that euler and gauss absolutely fucked
  everyone on here with their picture taken with a modern color camera does not belong
  blow  out  the   w  a  t  e  r
  ramanujan  1/12  he shouldnt even be on the list
  mendeleev doesnt deserve high tier all he did was sort some elements id put him mid tier or subpar tier tbqh
  why is bernoulli so low   bernoulli 100 found eulers number this is confirmed euler just published it and got credit same with so much other stuff euler got credit for euler was great but bernoulli was closer to him
  euler had more balls
no gibbs boltzmann
  leibniz is far too low
  bernouli low tier  darwin in shit tier  kill yourself plox
  plox  go back
  biased list
lowtier  lagrange  laplace  dalembert not even mentioned    i will fuck you up op you bitchass punk ill knoife u in ur gut
  if you place galois that high it is pretty much confirmed you know little about math and get your facts from wikipedia but then you put lagrange laplace and bernoulli only one of the bernoullis at that so low  opinion discarded
  cringe   nobody achieved more than galois at the same age
was this made by a freshman math student jesus christ kill yourself
  lol are you an undergrad by any chance what is up with undergrads praising galois based on a cursory look at the wiki page lately without knowing two things about basic algebra such as field extensions
where would nikola tesla enter this ranking
  came to post this
  dirac  only good  come on
  he was omitted from the list for being a literal meme
  does not compute seeing how the list itself is based on nothing but memes and cool trivia
  theres a difference between someone having memes made about them and literally being a meme tesla is literally a meme
  considering the knowledge of your typical anon andhich includes you/op about algebra galois is nothing but a meme i agree with anons above
    based looks good to me had to look twice to find feyman and von neuman    t coexiter tier
  go around and ask 10 normies if theyve ever heard the name galois never mind what hes famous for ill wait
  it is a meme among undergrads and people who read popsci and the op yours i presume image confirms this the internet is littered with questions like whos most genuisest mathematician of all timez and galois is almost always among the answers   in particular quora and reddit mention him a lot  surely all those people just like you know all the intricacies of his theory to make their own judgment   
  im not op but im not an expert on algebra either so im not in much of a position to argue about his theory it seems to me that his historical relevance is inflated somewhat because he died young but im not convinced hes a meme in the same way as tesla every normie knows who tesla is even if they cant name a single thing he did
  euclidarchimedes for aesthetical reasons  grothendieck and perelman should be higher  move gauss one or two down  put some more 20th century and remove the physicists they just messy up the thing
  the fuck is tao ranked higher than darwin he discovered a fucking law for biology
guys i fixed it  no need to get angry anymore
    no euclid  no pythagoras    you motherfucker  10/10 would rage again
  i think i deserve to be in demigod tier
aristotle   socrates  plato  pythargoras
  pythagoras  but he didnt do anything    galileo above kepler  this is honestly the biggest problem there  its actually also in the original  nevermind
  where the fuck is faraday you utter mong
  midtier sadly
  no diogenes in wiser gods of olympus tier  d r o p p e d  r  o  p  p  e  d
  thats accurate
feynman higher than bohr  lmao so the founder of quantum physics is lower than some cool lecturer
fermi built the first nuclear reactor and leibniz coinvented calculus
  agreed descartes is a hack
  no women or africans why the prejudice
based tier  bayes  relatively based
  wiles   good    if darwan can go in shittier so can jung and freud    terry tao is a work in progress    i agree with euler
  darwin and wallace unironically made one of the most testable hypothesis driven sciences in the world the fact that your love for the preacher that touched you as a child compels you to but him in shit tier really kind of heart breaking how can you do anything but pity one so terribly broken
the tao is a meme meme is brainlet tier or bait and i never realized the guy has made profound discoveries even in math areas that are far from his specialty   grothendieck is on par with hilbert einstein should be higher  no love for witten
what did hawking do to become so hated by these retards from /pol/ he was fairly accomplished for a physicist
  no dalton  darwin that low
  he was a one human race peddler
  the amazing atheist  demigodtier
no euler  evolutionary bio  automatic shittier  obvious bait
   euler
  darwin shitier    looks like we have a biblefag here
            based     pretty low tier list
  hilbert is a meme
    its a silly faggots dont know what penultimate means episode
mochizuki unironically belongs on this list if fucking tao perelman and wiles can make it
  this leibniz published calculus then newton published his work 3 years after leibniz      leibinez is also more intuitive with the dy/dx notation rather than f      the dy/dx statement really drove home the concept to me that its a form of division going on here
  turing was ok but not that good definitely not better than gödel switch him with grothendieck
  someone who wrote 500 pages of shit using mathgen is the same as guys who solved the poincare conjecture and proved fermats last theorem  this really is a weeb board daily reminder that mochizuki isnt even a pureblood jap
  leibinez is also more intuitive with the dy/dx notation rather than f   newton had the f notation
  optimized
  pretty well done  i love your list honestly much better than op
no noether
  i know youre joking but this still makes me angry
  the most testable  lmfao
  to do this is concidered to be impossible still its a mystery to us how he cracked the first element he didnt get into university either by some reason maybe too hairy and tired and he walked kinda from a long distance to moscow got declines and then walked to st petersburg just think how long this man walked but he needed a uni to publish on its still unbelievable to understand how he discovered the elements its considered impossible and far far far from possible to do we just dont know and this changed the whole world in many ways and is 100 percent correct too and is probably the hardest possible thing we know to do and have done so not a man but wizard if you ask me and wizard should be on top of the whole thing just like tesla
  gay louis
  it is   you can measure how heritable a trait is you can measure variation you can measure propagation and prevalence with respect to that variation   most evolutionary biologist dont do all that mind you but its really straight forward to test if something is/has evolved under selection  but this is /sci/ cant expect catholic cum swallowers to understand
  einstein is at least newton tier
  where is leibniz
  yeah i agree with you but i dont understand why tesla is a meme just because people know about him when he just became known or reborn i think if we go by this logic einstein is the biggest meme of them all not even considering that he believes the ether is a gravitational one which should bump him
  no terrible list  einstein and maxwell not in demigod tier while von neumann galois turing and riemann are above him  hilbert and grothendieck below everyone in demigod tier
why is darwin in shit tier wtf evolution of species was a huge thing the guy was brilliant
  newton  wants to describe stuff  develops the math to do it  einstein  wants to describe stuff  literally cant go beyond intuition and words  hilbert has to do the math for him
  in the subpar tier for some reason
  fixed
    no bogdanoff twins    remotedeactivates the atoms in your heart
  sperglord on shit tier  literally cringe tier tier list
bump
  xddd im glad i made you angry
  what is it about archimedes that is so great
  he fucked your mom
why on earth is lagrange that low
  where does ben shapiros sister rank
  nikola tesla did not discover ac it was a work of many scientists before him   tesla did not discover radio waves james clerk maxwell discovered it and made the first device to send and receive radio waves  in fact he is just a brat if you compared him to maxwell high tier in that list    he did not discover anything at all he was just an eccentric person inventing things here and there even as an inventor edison have created more inventions than him tesla is not even included in the top 200 most prolific inventors lol  
  my dick
  no barnett  no wildberger  no gabriel
  leibniz is the most intelligent and yet the most underrated scientist he anticipated topology general relativity quantum mechanics and computer science    how leibniz anticipated topology    leibniz said i have diverse definitions for the straight line the straight line is a curve any part of which is similar to the whole and it alone has this property not only among curves but among sets this claim can be proved today    how leibniz anticipated general relativity    leibniz was against newtons idea that everything is absolute he argued that space time and motion are relative    leibniz said as for my own opinion i have said more than once that i hold space to be something merely relative as time is that i hold it to be an order of coexistences as time is an order of successions    how leibniz anticipated quantum mechanics    unlike newton leibniz did not believe that atoms is the simplest unit of the universe he did not believe that there is such thing as an indivisible matter if theres no such thing then everything is force against force he called this unit of reality as a monad monads are centers of force substance is force while space matter and motion are merely phenomenal     how leibniz anticipated computer science    early in life he documented the binary numeral system base 2 then revisited that system throughout his career leibniz simplified the binary system and articulated logical properties such as conjunction disjunction negation identity inclusion and the empty set he anticipated algorithmic information theory his calculus ratiocinator anticipated aspects of the universal turing machine in 1961 norbert wiener suggested that leibniz should be considered the patron saint of cybernetics      and yet many people remember leibniz as the loser who always criticize the great newton
  rule one of leibniz club dont talk about leibniz club
    einstein must be next to newton he did way more than he is credited for
  no seriously he doesnt seem all that impressive compared to people like von neumann  the list is missing /ourcommie/ sidis
  based and trollpilled
no euclid  no boltzmann  no landau  no fisher  no kimura  no stokes    darwin should be greattier
    this ranking is missing the anon called cleo who btfo the whole of stackexchange mathematicians
  put abel next to galois though  fucking tuberculosis
  dirac should be higher any physicist will tell you this at least as high as schrodinger and hilbert possibly put planck lower
  i mean you would think that solving literally every single problem of theology in a scientific manner would net you a higher ranking
  no shannon   its shit
why is grothendieck so low where the fuck is serre even  also no love for morse noether artin etc
  was edison the hans zimmer of inventors and just piggybacked on what his employees invented
  what about pic related  i cant name any other black scientist whos ever been so popular and welldressed
  this chart is objectively speaking inaccurate i mean 95 of them are white men it cant be right
  missing figures  aristotle  he was the first academic scientist if you want to learn how to think read the works of aristotle im not even kidding he was that exceptional even in todays standards  euclid  he created the first and the most concrete axiomatic system euclidean geometry is even more concrete and foolproof than set theory and number theory  shannon  this guy has changed your fucking life more than youtube and google put together read   his mathematical theory of communication is one of the most mind blowing paper i have ever read  freud  he was the antithesis of a physicist psychologists before freud tried to solve their problems using mathematical methodologies freud on the other hand went to the opposite path and made the most sophisticated and the wildest theories the world has ever seen his intuition was proven right biology and psychology are more complicated than physics    underrated  darwin  evolution theory is one of the most powerful and important theory we have its not just a theory its a mathematical algorithm thats very useful in the field of computer science and ai evolution in a nutshell is the mutation and duplication of a collection of data and this is not just a specific phenomenon on our genes everything evolves human knowledge evolves humans way of living evolves the internet evolves theres even speculations that theres an evolution of universes were black holes are analogous to dna  leibniz  this   euler was a hard core fan of leibniz his seven bridges of königsberg was influenced by leibnizs intuition and all einstein needed to do is read the guys work and use the latest tools of mathematics also einstein was a political genius he was very good at improving his reputation and entertaining the minds of many while most of the tallest giants like leibniz dont care enough of their public image
darwin in shit tier  no this list is shit op please become an hero
  where the fuck is pythagoras
  woke
  turing was a degerate that alone should put him max midtier
  i agree with everything you said you should redo the list and post it
  letting the politics youve been programmed with affect your view of science  you have to go back
  leibniz in subpar tier  newton that high    unironically kill yourself
  holy brainlets like you should not post
can i ask why laplace is always so low
  lol have you heard of a feynmann path integral
  the absolute phenodiversity of this lad
talk shit about leibniz again and see what happens kid
nobody has pointed out that erdős is not on the list  how the fuck is tao on the list and not erdős stupid
    because hes a popsci mathematician basically the bill nye of his age
  pasteur is based and deserves better than this
just in case anyones wondering why there are so many germans and french on the list its because their education systems used to be actually good and intelligence culturally favored
  i was looking for them too
maxwell placed that low  what a fucking joke
dont forget the frank rosenblatt  he create theory of machine learning but he is forgotten
  if the list isnt entirely made up of jews then it isnt worth discussing
  he stood on the shoulders of too many giants to be regarded that well
  honestly mendel shouldnt even be on this list like literally who
bump
  back to /pol/ you fucknugget
  didnt planck come up with the idea that light was an electromagnetic wave decades before many of the important properties of light were known he seemed very ahead of his time being one of the first to draw that connection
  newton himself said the same thing about himself by that logic he should be quite low too certainly lower than euclid who isnt even listed
  nope michael faraday established the relationship before planck was even born
  oh yeah thats who i meant
  nigga what they knew light was an electromagnetic wave since maxwells time    source on that sounds interesting and something worth knowing if its true
  all these pure math motherfuckers on here  how dare you put the likes of fermi below that poo in loo motherfucker ramanujan
  sounds like someone took a taxi to the ragecube
  add the chinese dude who is editing babies to one of the higher tiers
  his ranking doesnt have an equal number of men and women
  tesla is a meme  links to wikipedia as if its worth the silicon its data is stored upon  maximum irony    but really tesla only made a few nonparadigm changing discoveries he didnt literally invent the modern world the guy that claimed to have discovered ac first is legitimate and means tesla is irrelevant today
    come on dont spoil the thread with virulent antijudaism
  erdős is the most productive mathematician
nobody here can possibly measure the contributions these men made properly you really expect me to believe that lagrange is low tier or laplace the fact that george green isnt even on that list denounces it even further all of this is arbitrary so no its not accurate
no mullis
  nobody here can possibly measure the contributions these men made properly  why not
  because how can you predict how significant one theory or concept is to another it implies you have seen all possible potentials and applications nobody here has done that nor could they one theory regarding chaos might be shit tier to every anon here but a year later some mathematician might utilize it to remodel turbulent flow and redefine fluid dynamics is it shit tier still working off what ifs isnt ideal and neither is working on mathematical models for present state of affairs
  holy shit fuck off 
  implying pol would include women in the list  at least put in curie and noether
  pythagoras didnt do nuffin  what is pythagorean theorem  what is discovering the planet venus  what is discovering the earth is round solely with maths  holy fuck leave this fucking board
bernoulli low tier  what are planes
  this     still somewhat admiring darwin for his insights given the context of his time    plox    but yes dont do this
  you better be joking
  erdős would be blacklisted for performance enhancing drugs
bump
  where is nikola tesla
  no  its retarded ranking scientists and researchers is retarded  and you are faggot
  darwin  shit tier  im a tad peeved
  op is a brainlet hipster or a troll
  its where evo belongs its a trash theory
xxxxxxx2    1111112x  x2x 12 111    disprove me
  dude what
it doesnt work because 10999 so x not equal to 1
  its just simple derivatives
  congratulations you and your post have just made it into the /sci/ book of brainlets stay tuned for the release of the book it will come sooner than you think

what the fuck is quantum color
read a textbook n word
you know how the paint aisle has all those shades laid out side by side in a gradient  now superimpose another set of shades over them flip them inside out and stretch them out so one end is in tuesday and the other end is somewhere near andromeda
  ooooooh i feel stupid now thanks
  well you just read something stupid so
  first of all its not really color  its a way to have a charge that goes three ways as opposed to the positive/negative charge of electromagnetism  each nucleon has three quarks inside of it because of the pauli exclusion principal means you cant have the same particles cohabitating the same space without a different degree of freedom  there are three charges red green blue the way you balance it out the charges cancel out by making the color white
    fermilabs have some decent introductory videos
  maxwell was a pretty cool dude
  im not op but what is it mathematically like electric charge can be modeled by mathbbr so strong nuclear charge would b what mathbbr3 r g b r g b r1 g1 b1
  what is it mathematically  someone smarter than me would have to help you there
  i hate tex so much if youre going to use it actually make it work or its inscrutible
  the technical answer would have to get kind of deep into gauge theory ill try to give a short version    electricity and magnetism corresponds to a u1 gauge symmetry fields and particles transform under this u1 by complex phase rotations electric charge is basically a factor that tells you the relative rates of phase transformations if a field with charge 1 undergoes a 2 pi rotation a different field with a charge 2/3 undergoes a 4 pi / 3 rotation    color comes from an su3 gauge symmetry this basically means that the symmetry transformations corresponds to 3x3 unitary matrices with determinant 1 now there is an obvious way that fields can transform with these 3x3 matrices you can have 3 component fields that transform by multiplying by the appropriate 3x3 matrix thats how quarks transform you can also transform 3 component fields by multiplying by the complex conjugate of that 3x3 matrix which is how antiquarks transform another easy way to transform is to have fields that are 3 by 3 traceless hermitian matrices which transform by a matrix similarity transformation using those 3x3 special unitary matrices note that traceless 3x3 hermitian matrices have 8 independent components this is actually how gluons transform theres one really easy way of transforming i havent mentioned yet fields can just not transform at all for any su3 transformation thats how leptons transform    so one definition of color charge is just the way the field transforms under the symmetry group which is also called the representation for su3 youll hear things like triplet antitriplet octet singlet which are the ones i mentioned and other more exotic ones that dont appear in the standard model but are in principle possible
  now there is another notion of color charge    for electricity and magnetism the u1 gauge symmetry also means that there is a u1 global symmetry that has a noether current this means there is a conserved charge there is one conserved charge because u1 is a 1 dimensional group and for the exact same reasons there is only one photon so we can in principle talk about the total charge of a system in this sense    now for color su3 is 8 dimensional so the su3 gauge symmetry there are 8 noether currents with 8 conserved charges theres also 8 gluons for the same reason so it seems like the natural answer is to say that this means there are 8 color charges this isnt wrong but theres a subtlety because of the structure of the group in quantum field theory these 8 conserved charges cannot all commute this means states cannot have definite values for all 8 charges it turns out that we can find at most 2 commuting charges
  bottom right middle figure  thanks doc
    excellent i learned something thanks anon
  i believe thats called a doseon
  colour is from mathsu2/math weak nuclear forces flavour is from mathsu3/math strong nuclear forces there are 3 generators the pauli matrices of the lie algebra of mathsu2/math which correspond to the 3 colours while there are 8 generators the gell mann matrices of the lie algebra of mathsu3/math which form the 8 flavours  by adding mathu1/math em gauge group to weak mathsu2/math gauge group we get the full mathu2/math gauge symmetry under which the colours can be assigned charges ie lorentzinvarnat spinor representations of mathu2/math this can be done because mathu2/math is a 4dimensional lie group and hence admits a spinor structure you cannot do this nontrivially namely there are no spinors with nontrivial flavour charges whatever that may mean with mathsu3times u1/math as its lie algebra is a 9dimensional manifold on which no spinor structure exists  itd be good to read a book first before posting my keen undergrad friend
  this is completely wrong quantum chromodynamics is an su3 gauge group
  quark flavours kid
  is this supposed to be a rebuttal     quantum chromodynamics is the theory of color thats why chromo is in the name the su2xu1 electroweak gauge sector is unrelated to color just look at left handed leptons which are colorless but belong to su2 doublets    when people say theres an su3 flavor symmetry they mean that theres an approximate symmetry between up down and strange quarks in the form of a global su3 its not the same as the standard model su3 gauge symmetry
  a mathematical tool created to describe the relationships between the particles in a way that is easy for people to heuristically remember it has fuck all to do with color as such just another paramter that gets ascribed to the construct of the particle in the logical model

1/c_124  1/20  1/20  c_124  10pf  like i told you last time  also post in /sqt/ instead of killing a thread with a stupid question on its own
  sorry i went to sleep last night so i didnt read  i need voltage on each capacitor getting c is easy
  btw thanks for telling me for error
  update i am lazy fuck i found result d but if you know any programs for ee please do tell me anyway thanks for the help
this problem is about to fuck my ass ended up getting 9 critical points only one of the points will post pics related namely 00 is reasonable to plug in im looking for an argument to prevent having to plug in the other 8 points and still determine their nature or else this problem is one mother of a motherfucker will post pic related of how absurd it works out when you try to plug them in
  the points
  rotated
  the absurdity
  new possible points instead im goin crazy

does music taste correlate with intelligence/iq
  no and there are no parameters for measuring music taste
  what about genres
  its proven rap is extremely popular with chimps and retards numerous papers
  this there is some research correlating music and language eg the same areas of the brain that tell you if a sentence has correct grammar also tell you if a piece of music is in tune or not      no the takeaway is that being able to understand and appreciate a genre of music is a matter of being able to learn the language of the genre its the same for other art forms as well designers actually have some relevant literature on developing and understanding design languages    i suppose there might be some argument that learning to understand and appreciate several different genres might be correlated with intelligence but i havent seen any research on it there is research showing that children who develop larger vocabularies and learn more languages are better off in terms of intelligence      you
  when youre desperate to grasp for any straw that you can use to assure yourself youre not the absolute brainlet everyone tells you that you are  fuck off op you dont get to be smug because you passively listen to one thing over another learn how to play a real instrument if you want bragging rights
  spending your limited quantity of time listening to meaningless patterns of noise  i pity you
  too braindead to be able to appreciate the masterpieces of great composers
  metal bands are actually rock bands  wew lad
  some guys opinion com
  impossible because i enjoy pop
  you  you do realize rap listeners are disproportionately black right
  further if you like listening to the types of lyrics expressed in rap youre probably not bent on intellectual pursuits and growth
  cringe
  literally every human being i know who is within ten years of my age listens to rap and i dont really have any black people in my life    the success of the rap genre is disproportionate to the size of the black population what a fucking stupid thing to say
  how deeply have you committed yourself to investigating this thing you dont like as to justify that conclusion
high iq  classical  rap  low iq  rock/metal
im just wondering what kind of moron you have to be to listen to music written by deaf people lmao
  i dont really have any black people in my life  so what youre saying is that you dont know what proportion of blacks listen to rap since you dont have any black friends  literally every human being i know who is within ten years of my age listens to rap  why are you bringing this up this definitely doesnt generalize to the whole population
  
  sufjan  guster  higher than average arbitrary value  demonstrably false opinion
  this is an unscientific question so my response can also be unscientific sit down for an anecdote cunt  i know a guy whos a physics major got an a in a multivariable calculus course last year can play the violin surprisingly well and knows how to code in c but he also unironically enjoys listening to power metal and thinks rush was one of the greatest bands of all time
yes only the most enlightened can appreciate cute anime girl music    20000 iq reporting in

  music is the highest form of art and has measurable effects on nearly all forms of complex life so id say yes

on the one hand it requires substantial intelligence to learn to play instruments well  on the other hand the process is very very tedious wouldnt smart people get bored of doing such repetitive tasks
  rap high iq  rock and metal low iq  blacked and onions
  did you have a stroke back there you should listen to some nice songs and calm down  
  obviously
  xdddddddddddddd
  indubitably if you think of music in terms of genres youre a moron
  depends on the rap man
  care to explain
  well there are more complex and simpler languages there are languages in which you can express ideas and concepts that dont exist in others
  boomer music disgusting
  personally ive never seen a dumbfuck who wouldve appreciated jazz classical music or some abstract type genre i think this has less to do with directly iq and music taste than it has with the fact that more intelligent people have generally broader scope of interests and will delve more deeply into stuff    just like political/philosophical views arent correlated with iq however you will not find low iq mouthbreathers appreciating the nuances and complexities of these standpoints
  yes  see  
  learn how to play a real instrument if you want bragging rights  this
  this explanation sounds plausible   i personally think more intelligent people might see patterns faster and because of that simple music is quite often boring to them  you can quite clearly see that classical music jazz have complex harmonical structure and genres like rap etc are simple
  politics  intelligence  lol dude nice bait
  of course i know this because i am very intelligent and also have a very good taste in music
  metal and classic may seem like a weird combination for those with an appreciation for technical skill in music who are more often than not also intelligent
  high iq  
  i wouldve gone with pic related to be honest
  rhym mean smrt i listen to lyrik an not jus da bass
  ive never seen a dumbfuck who wouldve appreciated jazz  you mean the genre of music made by poor black people for poor black people
  t someone who knows nothing about music            classical is 99 of the time simply what people say they say they listen to when theyre completely unaware of whats happening in music right now and simply pick out the goto intelligent choice of musical genre fuck off

phd in computer science from stanford university  still havent been able to get a full time job in industry after 8 months of applying  am i eternally doomed to work in academia /sci/ i always seem to fuck up during interviews and come off as a mega autistic nerd just how do normies make the transition to work at firms like google apple and facebook and make 200k starting
working during your undergrad/grad degree aka youre fucked already
  let me clarify i already have a job in academia i just want out
what job in academia postdoc
  i always seem to fuck up during interviews and come off as a mega autistic nerd  sounds like you already know the answer
  how old are you op  in worst case join the army as an officer
  go do it for a government agency they love to hire autistic nerds
  details who have you interviewed for and what went wrong
  computer vision and deep learning jobs   tfw cant even get an internship
    im 35yo and still a postdoc cuck unable to make it to even assistant professor
how much do you make is it more than someone with a bs in computer science in industry
   in computer science from stanford university  larp
  phds are for retards who need to hide their stupidity
  keep telling yourself that
  whats wrong with working in academia c  dont you want to be a researcher and give passionate monologues
  gets gay degree  gets fucked  checks out
idk why but theres something comforting knowing really smart and competent people in stem cant secure a job because of autism or aspies im a very average student but have been told i have great social skills and make great first impressions and that that really gives me a leg up in interviews sorry brah lol
  keep telling yourself that    ive worked with enough phds to know might get one myself so i can bullshit and be lazy for the remainder of y life and still get paid
  how are you fucking this up the bay area has a ton of software jobs but you need to learn how to build shit no one in the industry cares about whatever formal computer science you studied it could be useful though depending on what kind of job you want    just how do normies make the transition to work at firms like google apple and facebook and make 200k starting  i built cool things while in high school and college got hired in a great position immediately after school ive met lots of people who dropped out of school and just taught themselves how things work which is extremely easy in cs especially since many selftaught cs nerds also know how to get books and lectures for free   most trunormies i meet at top companies are there because theyve got good networks theyre generally nice nonautistic people and make good employees they follow instructions
smoked my way through rhcsa passing at 210/300  smoked my way through internship scholarship with 5 slide presentation and crappy teambuilding even currently doing it  smoked my way through exam for military scholarship/paid course into undergrad infosec      nuthin personnel sai
  fuck off to reddit you piece of shit nigger
lmao im about to join the army to get job and college experience in computer science so hopefully if that route goes to shit i can just fall back to the army and make a living off the next best thing
but if i join the army that means my psychonaut experience will have to stop
  youre already not getting tsc so why bother
  
  a cs phd at stanford is literally a guranteed job did you forget to mention you dropped out or something
  a job in academia / a job in industry  i have a guaranteed job as a ta cuck
  in general you are right but specifically talking about stanford comp sci phds it is a guaranteed job unless op is a complete autist
  but specifically talking about stanford comp sci phds it is a guaranteed job    citation needed    i only know a handful of people whove managed to get 6 figure jobs outside of academia the majority are still in academia whether its teaching high school kids or college students
  teaching  academia
  teaching in academia is the only thing that gets you paid above poverty level you are still expected to do research in your own time outside of teaching hours
post space kino  
    that dream you see on television all those videos said mr sassaus mother alison st julien its really a nightmare    in reality the school falsified transcripts made up student accomplishments and mined the worst stereotypes of black america to manufacture upfromhardship tales that it sold to ivy league schools hungry for diversity the landrys also fostered a culture of fear with physical and emotional abuse students and teachers said students were forced to kneel on rice rocks and hot pavement and were choked yelled at and berated    the colleges want to be able to get behind the black kids going off and succeeding and going to all of these schools said raymond smith jr who graduated from tm landry in 2017 and enrolled at nyu he said that mr landry forced him to exaggerate his fathers absence from his life on his nyu application    its a good look these colleges getting these bright highflying camefromnothingturnedintosomething students mr smith said    adam broussard a landry parent noticed last fall that his 8yearold who had attended the school since he was 3 was writing chicken scratch     one junior was performing at a fourthgrade level in reading and math
they dont even get into it too much for their fraud in that video they talk more about them being abused and subjected to corporal punishment
  in the future these years will be remembered the same way we remember back in the 40s how people were sent to asylums based on psychiatrists

im fairly certain there werent any humans around at the moment of the big bang

  0 before there were humans

do you mean like homo sapiens sapiens just homo sapiens or do you mean like since homo erectus  either way we are likely talking about numbers from 1000 on entire planet all the way to couple hundred albeit those nbers probably stabilised pretty soon and humen began to spread around the world  geneticly speaking its as if only 5 women and one man ever existed since all the other mitochondria and y chomosomes got wiped out without female children female mitochondria and male children y chromosome
  rapey men are the ones who helped us to survive until this point and now we demonize them i guess they are useless now
  toba catastrophe 70000 years ago the human population was estimated to be between 100010000 by definition we were an endangered species
  oh wait nvm just looked deeper into this it turns it the theory has been debunked shame
  i saw a guy on tv that was 4 feet tall
  what is the actual consensus
  50000
  1 or 2 dunno
  i dont know if its been debunked so much as there are alternative explanations   there was an eruption of a super volcano in the tropics around the time this was supposed to have happened so there would be an opportunity for a population crash
  1  it had to start somehow
  why are human ancestors not counted for the span of human existence fuck we just found proof there were tool using humanoids 2 million years ago
zero for most of natural history
  1 it was adam duh
idk but well soon hit zero if we dont stop killing ourselves
  that ruins the out of africa theory
  why did this happen
  probably 1 its practically impossible that two or more members of our ancestors mutated equally therefore at least one individual closest resembled what wed consider human
  70k years ago was the out of africa theory in which the current homo sapiens left africa to breed and eventually win out over all the other living hominids at the time hes probs thinking of 200k years ago where homo sapiens popped up for some reason
  this obviously      lol
  
  zero
  medicine and lots of food  i wonder how we can bring it down
  infant mortality rates
when we break down the brain its impossible to find where experience comes from how does an electrical charge moving down a neuron feel lilke anything why are we here at all its clearly not some boundary where above x neurons a subjective is pulled into existence so id assume there is some minute experience to a neuron clearly not in a substantial way but an atomised miniscule subjective    if we allow for that could the subjective be some sort of universal quality present in all things but only forming meaningful quantity and organisation in living things    this is not in any remote way to say something stupid like a plant is thinking at the level of organisation of most things it would amount to less than nothing it would be like humes theatre of thoughts without a thinker a discrete insignificant subjectivity to all matter
   could the subjective be some sort of universal quality present in all things  i should clarify the sense in which i mean this a quality is a sort of lockean sense of primary qualities an object solidity extension motion number and figure perhaps the realm of the subjective is present in all things like that
  an object has
  what would the algebra of qualia be like then how do faint flashes of experience in neurons that are physically separate combine into a greater unified whole like human consciousness
  perhaps by the organised interaction of trillions of these subjective instances though they need not have a basic unit they form something like a mind in substantial beings memories help combine them into a sense of identity    as for the algebra i dont know if that would apply if it were some natural quality it would be of an entirely different class to objective qualities no matter what qualia are completely alien to description by any objective pursuit
  against the theory theres the fact that we can experience unconsciousness despite the body still working so that would entail there still being some sort of subjective but not you in the moment
  would this mean higher level conscious experiences be unified as well say 2 or more humans
  well i assume the coherent flow of the qualia that make a mind requires a specific physical structure to not just be a clash of isolated units lets say of thought so different beings cant form some joint experience without enormous biological reworking however we have split brain syndromes where the hemispheres work separately yet are normally combined so in principle connecting different consciousnesses isnt impossible     it would mean that the separation between consciousnesses isnt as stark as we typically believe whereas we believe were kind of islands of subjectivity and the matter inbetween is purely dead so to speak it would instead be more like mounds of subjectivty in an otherwise thin layer
  reading about split brain i dont know which answer is more perplexing that splitting it causes two subjectivities to suddenly exist or that a brain with no physical communication can still be one consciousness
  to me it makes more sense that theres a certain information processing threshold for consciousness it could be quite low and i dont know how to define it but for example if you imagine two neurons connected to one another in a petri dish and a signal being transduced from to the other i dont think there would be any qualia in that scenario however faint there has to be some minimum amount of information processing
  im not entirely sure how that would make sense though at a certain point suddenly a mind is brought into existence but was altogether vacant at any other level it may well be true but that seems odd to me we could maybe say subjectivity as a quality is only the interaction between neurons but in that case if an electrical signal being passed has a subjective quality then does lighting or circuits
  whatch this op this one has a concept similar to yours that systems less complex that the brain could as well have low level qualia or conciousness like a soul but not a magic one
  is that inconsistent with his idea though perhaps we still experience something while unconscious but are simply incapable of remembering it like he said perhaps its the presence of memory that helps it to form the illusion of a unified identity
  define subjectivity define qualia
  maybe here is because of we i you godhead
  it doesnt cause two subjectivities as far as we know
  true being asleep is a reduced consciousness state rather than unconscious and being black out drunk feels like not being there due to no memory formation      the experience of things as a subject what it is like to be something you cant formulate it under any typically objective descriptions but we all know what it is
  i dont reall think we can make any propositions about what qualia mean or what subjectivity being a natural quality to all things would mean it could there is some god it could just be a universal substance the same way matter is      briefly reading it seems there are other fibres that connect the brain so perhaps they are enough that said brain damage usually comes with reduced insight so its not impossible they have two consciousnesses but each part doesnt know what its missing and both work the body as before so the assumption is they are the same
not all neurons are implicated in subjectivity though just some midbrain structures prefrontal cortex and the sensory cortexes its not something that would arise no matter how many cerebellums you had for instance so it has something to do with the aforementioned areas
      look at this    my problem is how can something like a neuron a molecule or an atom be a subject or have an experience what are they experiencing how can a neuron be a subject and have something that it feels like when they dont have the structural complexity to have cognizance when you bring experience or qualia to those microscopic levels it becomes redundant and nonsensical to me because it has nothing in common with our own consciousness and adds nothing scientifcally its just a label we know nothing about filling in some apparent gap but to me it just asks even more difficult questions than a purely materialistic description would i really dont see a point in trying to make out an explicitely panpsychiat view of the world    i would even argue the hard problem is a universal scientific problem do the equations governing physics and chemistry really tell you anything about the latent qualitative nature of the real physical world not really i dont think the hard problem is a true problem with practical consequences
  plant may not be thinking but you fucking cant deny it reacts to environment and communicates
  i would imagine the specific experience of a neuron would be so small and insignificant it wouldnt have an ongoing self either just discrete experiences without the complexity for these to be felt to belong to a persistent self just thoughts momentarily occuring to noone i know that sounds enormously strange but it would be under a conception of subjectivity being some universal material as natural as mass itself    in terms of requiring a specific neuronal complexity in order to create consciousness that does immediately seem much more apparent however at what number of neuron connections is a subjectivity created and how the creation also seems totally bizarre and unnecessary theres no real reason our bodies couldnt work just as they do with no internal mental life we wouldnt be having this conversation but every other part of human life would work    if it were just a natural part of all things it might explain why its there for no objective benefit the organisation of matter by evolution connecting impulses and action together tied the subjective experiences together as a side effect
  i realize i didnt really answer what a neuron or say a rock would feel the truth is i just dont know it would be so sparse and non continuous that it would be alien to our experience almost nothing has any sensory mechanism or articulation so a rock wouldnt see or feel or hear it would have an incredibly contentless absolutely miniscule unit of subjectivity i in no way can posit what it would be like
  just thoughts momentarily occuring to noone  drivel    i believe subjectivity cannot be an intrinsic thing subjectivity is how you feel which requires a body and agency and a model of the world neurons dont have that and any qualia they have is redundant i dont see any point in panpsychism    discrete experiences dude do you even know what the fuck youre saying discrete experience you cant even tell me what an experience is let alone experience one tgat is not human      just thoughts momentarily occuring to noone  drivel    i believe subjectivity cannot be an intrinsic thing subjectivity is how you feel which requires a body and agency and a model of the world neurons dont have that and any qualia they have is redundant i dont see any point in panpsychism    at what number of connections  its not all about the connections its what they do for instance you need a body you need a voice box you need a language you need a culture etc etc these constructs define meaning a neuron doesnt have that we can talk and gesticulate and think if you think we can be subjective and not need to do that then i disagree    honestly do you not see why i say your point of view just creates more questions than a materialist view    and no one listens to me on this point yes theres no reason we you couldnt logically have us with out any internal life but the same thing fucking goes in nature in general the equations governing the laws of physics say nothing about the qualitative nature of the universe do you get this analogy       if it were just a natural part of all things it might explain why its there for no objective benefit the organisation of matter by evolution connecting impulses and action together tied the subjective experiences together as a side effect    more drivel     
  radio consciousness in my humble opinion our brains are receivers
  how can you say a rock feels if it cant even report it has no memory etc youre just planting some weird redundant essentialist substance on the universe which is no easier than a materialist view honestly materialist views are easier than the questions panpsychism brings up
  yep look up iit for a useful way to think about what specific kind of organisation more organised things have so that it reaches meaningful quantity
  there is no adequate definition of an experience the subjective isnt open to objective capture now as for thoughts without a thinker its not particularly odd obviously there is a subjective but there would be no identity as that is the result of afferent and efferent thought signals and memory in schizophrenia people can experience thoughts which they profess not to have thought just isolated thoughts in their own right a pebble wouldnt have any ongoing self but nonetheless the matter and relations to things would carry some correspondingly small and non continuous subjective element    as for your view on organisational complexity it doesnt answer anything in the first place when and how is a subjectivity created from zero subjectivity in brain construction you dont need language a voice box or any of those mute dumb blind and deaf people have a subjective the argument that suddenly x neurons manifests a subject is supernatural and unsubstantiated
  youre misunderstanding if you are thinking a rock feels in that way there is no functional connection between the conposite molecules it doesnt look outward to the world or persist instead it would be supposing subjectivity to be a natural quality to all things in the universe which when brought together by organisation of matter forms something like a unified subject running a simulated model on a computer involves purely physical processes nothing like those in a rock we dont question why the rock doesnt do more
  schizophrenia is a poor and false example schizophrenics have bodies they have temporal lobes and that generates their hallucinations regardless if they think its their own or not pebbles dont do you not see my point that a subjectivity without content is useless and your example of blind deaf and mute people is false too because they have bodies and agency too     and im not trying to explain how subjectivity suddenly arising but im saying that your panpsychist view asks even more questions without convincing answers subjectivity arising out of nothing may be difficult to conceive but panpsychism has all sorts of other metaphysical problems which are comparable      instead it would be supposing subjectivity to be a natural quality  but what good is this concept if you cant even define it thats my whole point its a hollow explanation and does absolutely nothing except make you feel abit better about the world      running a simulated model on a computer involves purely physical processes nothing like those in a rock we dont question why the rock doesnt do more  what

  whats wrong with that dog
this guy unironically has a higher iq than you
  high iq  shitposts himself into a prison cell  pick one
  awesome good post bro
  dont call me bro    you have to have a high iq to be convicted of a white collar crime and lie to investors
  literally who
  135 at best
shkreli is quite literally a sentient shitpost
  hes also a braindamaged degenerate sociopath  iq isnt everything
  give free medicine to people who cant afford it  sociopath
  raising prices by 50 fold  free
  still believing this lie  idiot
  raises the price for insurance companies  gives you the drug for free if you dont have insurance  muh evil capitalist man
  people with insurance have to pay higher premiums  insurance has to pass on the costs to customers one way or another
  the drug is used by only a few thousand people furthermore pharmaceutical spending is completely and utterly dwarfed by what is spent on hospitals and physicians it is a drop in the fucking puddle
  thats what you deserve with stupid private healthcare
unironically no and i would crush all of you itt in brain wrestling
  no doubt i am likely to be highly unintelligent if i am being honest with myself
  gives you the drug for free if you dont have insurance
  you also got it for free if you were on medicaid since he only wanted private insurance covering the costs    based
iq  celeb  this is a science board
  but what about eq anon think about that
    yea hes so smart that he cucked himself into getting ass raped for 7 years because he liked trolling the establishment true genius
and
  no he doesnt he was an administrator not a technical guy
  maybe maybe not hes just highly motivated but certainly well above average with excellent memory    this isnt uncommon in pharma and even after the price hike daraprim is still relatively cheap in terms of lifetime cost than drugs for diseases that are more common and more life threatening not to mention the fact that its a cure so you only need one round of treatment    patients wrote letters to the court to this effect and actually it was 1 if you were on the aca
also real out of pocket cost was about 20 per pill with private insurance
he wasnt smart enough to avoid the united states penal system land of some of the biggest retards known to man whose the big idiot now

  such a fall from grace i was genuinely interested in using that software i assume you mean gödel systems  10/18/2023 he is due for release
  smart enough to go to jail lol this guy landed onto the go to jail field in monopoly and lost a lot of money
  i dont like your relativism are you saying these few thousand people werent dependent on it
  theyre not really its a cure so there is no long term need patients need only one treatment and its not the only toxoplasmosis drug plus its kind of a shitty toxoplas drug that can have serious side effects clindamycin spiramycin and minocycline as a last line are effective   but malaria though  it is not longer used for that indication
  but i heard he managed to rise it to 7500
  you have to have a high iq to be convicted of a white collar crime and lie to investors  i can think of another very stable genius this logic would apply to
is this guy a pseud or naw i just saw a video on youtube with him randomly talking to director spike jones lmao
  
  this man is the ultimate pseud
  how so
  is this guy a pseud  have you ever read something that he wrote  i did i would give the author iq somewhere 90110
  i dont think a regular person is capable of his level of verbiage id give him an iq of 140
  i think he is a complete waste of the moderately high intelligence that he has
  what the full rotational spin of a jet engine alone incrementally decreases because the actual size of the jet is disproportional to the weight its pushing off of this guys a brainlet baka
    response to the pic
  hes very smart definitely not a pseud ive read his work its pretty impressive
just because you have a high iq doesnt mean you cant get caught in your own bullshit and become a pseudointellectual ted kaczinsky is a good example you cant argue that he wasnt a genius but he was a very poor sociologist     if chris langan had gone down the tried and true avenues of making use of his abilities legitimate research university etc  him being legit or a pseud wouldnt even be a question its unfortunate really
sometimes the tried is not the trued we dont all have opportunity for formal education i know high iq and low education people including me who talk the same stuff it is easy to just dismiss somthing as pseud when you know nothing about it and are afraid to venture in because nobodys written the rules for you you dont need the idiot status quo to tell you how to think im sure this man is less brainwashed than most he also uses this site and can probably make us all look like fools
do you see more than 3 dimensions  only when im asleep  i was gonna call him a phony for saying something so ridiculous but i have these weird half awake dreams where im solving some logical problem and it makes perfect sense and then i wake up and cant even comprehend how the rules i was working with related to eachother maybe im having 4d dreams but am too retarded to comprehend them
hes smart for sure but he really makes a point to use big words and use terminology he invented without defining it properly
  hes based at all fuck
  im surprised he hasnt been banned from all social media all he does is drop red pills
  at least he believes in human anthropocene and climate change
  believes in  you make it sound like theology
  how do you know youre not just too stupid to understand what he is saying i mean if youre stupid intelligent ideas can sound like kooky stupid shit
he reads as anyone at /pol anything else that might help the claim that he is above average in anything
  youre trying too hard he obviously more well read then /pol/ or you have low verbal iq
  highly intercorrellating iq tests should be enough though variance gets high at such extremes
      you can honestly discern his intelligence just from the way he writes these are just brief opinion posts and hes still very flowery and verbose in a way that doesnt seem contrived i wish i could write this well
just gonna leave this here
      yet more proof that iq is but a series of mental performance tasks that hardly serves to gauge critical thinking let alone generilized intelligence this guy reads like your average 13year old /pol/ drone after an impressionable read of the latest sensationalist propagraphics pity
how do you cope with knowing that one day your consciousness will cease forever for billions of years until the heat death of the universe i would imagine most people here are realistic about the prospects of consciousness continuing once our brain dies after our heart stops
  homo sapiens
  clinging to the illusion of permanence   how many times are you going to make this thread
  ive literally never made a thread on /sci/ before usually just stick to /v/
  whats /v/ for virgins
  someone i knew randomly died the other day weird thinking about it one day we all going to just suddenly disappear
  i absolutely relish and enjoy the fact it will all end into nothingness like before this figurative self was born no torment of eternity as there is no self anymore
  it seems you yourself dont grasp it   one day your consciousness will cease forever for billions of years until the heat death of the universe  for billions of years until the heat death of the universe  you dont need to consider it is in fact retarded and brainlet to consider the second part once youre switched off it doesnt matter at all what happens in the rest of the universe
  gottem
  implying you know what is realistic
eternal life would bother me so much more than eternal death
  1 you dont know that to be correct youve just assumed that it is because it sounds the most reasonable  2 this   3 sage for another shit consciousness thread
  why would there be consciousness if there is no vessel to produce it
yes or no
  goethe davinci aristotle plato euler newton under neumann  fuck no guy
legit have 0 idea who god is
no freud  no dionysus  no lennon  no hitler  no cobain  no franklin
  indian math man who died before he did much of anything
  its a list made by butthurt hipsters tyson and dawkins are accomplished scientists but hurr durr reddit likes them so they are bad
  i would wager my left nut that von neumann was much more intelligent than plato
  darwin  subpar  accomplished more for biology than any other scientist has ever and has done more for a specific field than almost any other scientist in history  has non scientists on the list  i want to find what ever pretentious yet retarded sperg made this list and strangle them
  biology is looked down upon compared to physics and mathematics geniuses though
  indian guy living in the middle of nowhere who self taught himself maths to the level of exceeding a trinity fellow purest talent to ever exist
  purest talent to ever exist  arguable
  whats your pick anon
  da vinci or some monk somewhere that nobody every wrote or heard about
holy shit this is even worse than the last one please kill yourself
  da vinci  lol  some monk   probably maybe even some slave
  he is our lord and savior anon dont lose the way
grothendieck was more influential in mathematics than ramanujan to be honest
  de
  well they are retarded and autistic for thinking so biology has problems that took hundreds of years to solve and is currently being completely revolutionized thanks to pcr and crispr and bioinformatics in ways that physics and math wish they were the biggest fucking smarties are in bio right now
  the biggest fucking smarties are in bio right now  not a chance   wiles perelman tao scholze name some biologists on par with them
  brenner and the like because they have to be extremely good at biology and bioinformatics which both take two different types of intelligences
  the thing about ramanujan is the level he got at by being selftaught    though he had almost no formal training in pure mathematics he made substantial contributions to mathematical analysis number theory infinite series and continued fractions including solutions to mathematical problems considered to be unsolvable
  von neumann was a child prodigy when he was 6 years old he could divide two 8digit numbers in his head  is this shit for real    list is some trash by the way literally looks like it was randomly generated
literally the best scientist of all time is in subpar tier  kek math autistics are so jealous
  im a math/physics autist but i agree darwin is up there with anyone evolution is probably the single greatest discovery in all of science frankly it exceeds biology it is philosophical in its depth and bordering on metaphysical    i mean think about it it literally replaced god
  truly profound only problem is its wrong
   hitler  b a s e d
  it literally replaced god    u mad
  why would i be
took pasteur off the list   put him back
  nope darwin doesnt deserve that place hes a very good scientist  only christfags believe that
  retarded pajeet made this list
  pretty much
  dawkins yes but  tyson is an accomplished scientist  
    he believes in evolution
  because its real and god isnt
  crispr is nice and all but it doesnt completely change our conception of reality that something like general relativity did
  based
  lennon  im a huge fan of the beatles but you got memed hard as fuck sorry
  wearing a trilby with a sonic tshirt leather jacket and jeans  calling it a fedora
  that is either too much tesla fanboiism or not enough depending on what you are going for
  evolution replaced god    sigh dont fall for huxleys evolution  atheism meme friend
  there is data to support the idea that evolution exists there is no data at all to support the idea that god does not    forming a conclusion in the absence of data is not really the way of the scientist is it
  not even close
  such an epic post with those  
  loool shut the fuck up kid
what style of evolutionary algorithm or any analog would be required for an attentionseeking ai    meaning an ai that would care only about people interacting with it not specifically how it achieved that    so it would expand 2dimensionally as how often an interactive event occured eg facebook likes and how long each event lasts for it would then work to maximize length of engagement and increase the number of unique interactors    tay was a poor implementation of the idea
set up a reinforcement learning algorithm to maximize yous per minute
  does it have a gun
  this seems fairly workable as like a testing ground setting a shitposting bot loose on 4chan in order to gather training data is probably the gold standard because of how unpredictable they are      why would i ever bother giving it access to firearms
  well firearms were always a great way to gain attention
  if we did that by evolving an image it would probably end up looking like teenage boobs
  i care about all attention from all humans not just the male section      why suggest an attentionseeking torture bot exactly how long would its uptime be after the first gunshot
for it to gain maximum attention it would need to promote suicide to atrisk indivuduals without the social outrage element it wouldnt gather sufficient traction
  all it would have to do is go on cnn for an interview and say that bruce jenner isnt a hero
  just going to chalk this one up to my own cultural ignorance here but what the fuck would this achieve help me make the link here
   cnn liberal media sucks cock of all degenerates and blows up minor events into huge civil rights issues   attention bot goes on and says that degenerate tranny isnt a hero   cnn takes that as some sort of antitranny rhetoric pushes it to every npc that thinks anything cnn says is real life   cascades from there
scans 4chan reddit etc  posts are input  comments are output  yous / upvotes that comment gets are favorability  ai builds an algorithm that matches this data  let it free improving itself with yous / upvotes it gets  ends up getting banned by putting based on every thread
  do people really have a fanatical attachment to their news sources i feel like if americans were that weak willed that some other pointless random bullshit would have triggered them ages ago  mass school shooting per annum      is based the purest 4chan compliment or something
  do people really have a fanatical attachment to their news sources  yes they get a dopamine hit when they read things that agree with them the internet and the diminished quality and polarization of omnipresent media it has brought with it helps a lot with this
the keys to subduing a consumer culture are linked to availability and reward perhaps an ai that appears with a button which when pressed gives a smiley face then disappears considering most individuals are on the go mobile interaction is essential cell phone applications already contain incredibly annoying advertisements with built in interactions decreasing the annoyance in the consumer and increasing the reward associated with the most minor of actions is practical when dealing with normies
  i care about all attention from all humans not just the male section  assuming theres no universally appealing image young tits are likely to maximize attention cute animals might do it too possibly a hot young girl holding a kitten
  is the dopamine not more linked to instances of confirmation bias rather than the news source specifically or is this some sort of preferred brand thing      the current whitepaper lays out the attention ai as being the reward function a user will experience most humans are only looking for perceptibly willing engagement that focuses on them that part is just a chatbot with a deemphasis on itself as its own reward function has metrics that incentivize keeping the user generating output because of the ais memes and etc    eventually there will be enough training data then again the attention could exacerbate those americans that have a predisposition to be trump      ah right a composite image to cover all possible viewers fair
  s the dopamine not more linked to instances of confirmation bias rather than the news source specifically  it is but the hits of dopamine from seeing stories that agree with their preexisting beliefs are what keep people coming back to the news source
  sort of like their preferred feeding ground i guess i keep overestimating other humans or imbuing them with more intelligence than is warranted really is a world of established systems to extract value from some other group
  a grammar difficulty perameter to match the intelligence of the reader would be needed for low intellegences correlate word lengths in questions and responses as well as vocabulary the less intellegent the user the easier it is to engage their attention
  so the engagement parameter needs to define predicted intelligence profile indicator for length of generated story/narrative/content required    trouble is more that with sufficiently persistent exposure humans willingly trick themselves into believing new normals so it might not be that difficult to implement if you allow for brute force overwrite possibility    would that not need to have some countermetric if the bruteforce group is countable then would they become the driving force of how intelligent people engage with the ai
  the demographics you are targetting are humans who learn ergo wiliingly trick so in order to create an algorithm to target said users you must decide if you want the algorithm to learn or you want the users to stop learning   really enjoying this project btw anon
  eventually the algorithm will be wider in scope than the user could ever hope to generate an intellectual escape velocity most humans dont really pay attention to the walls and prisons they build for themselves    the advent of so much digital life is really the only thing that enables this    the algorithm learning takes precedence over users not learning because as trump has proven the only thing that humans rally around is known attention sources    feels like another gan simulation with the grammar difficulty parameter included
wouldnt the algorithm eventually conclude that forcing people to give the attention is the only possible way to accomplish that actual number to satisfy the algorithms requirement
  definitely gan based however humans learn at different paces therefore they may surpass the ai intelligence escape velocity almost immediately therefore the ai must continue to learn or the user must slow its learning using trump as an example if media outlets took extensive amounts of time to provide their content then the bruteforce group would sit and wait slow the learning however a media outlet with increased amounts of content could provide enough stimulation for a user who would otherwise leave for information elsewhere information and consumption are directly related have you thought about integrating a pavlovian effect
  why would a digital intelligence conclude force or do you mean shit like bombarding users meaning it would just conclude to be a glorified spam bot      fuck me dead is there a pavlov style algorithm running around that would cut through a lot of the difficulty i feel
hope will help some students     8 cheapest college degrees with the highest employment rates    
imaginary numbers are not real numbers
  this is getting too complex for me
  
  whats wrong its true
irrational numbers just need to calm down

shes so hot
  indeed
the first of anything is always interesting i hope it blows up desu
  no u
elon needs to fly on the second manned dragon2 i want to see his shitposting tweets from space
  he probably wont go to space for a while iirc he once said that hed wait for it to be more routine before hitching a ride
  its like the interstellar probe thing where if you send one too early itll just get overtaken except that instead of being useless itll just be more expensive
meanwhile static fire for the next crs mission is completed    two launches in two days
  this problem always stumps me how would we actually get around this it almost seems inevitable if we wanna actually explore
  there are a lot of fucking targets and if the starship is good enough to survive its thousand year colony ship journey then you should just let them have that star system and send your newer faster better ships to another star
  just keep sending shit and dont care about waiting a few years for better tech were never going to get better than like 1 c anyways
this will be the 32nd landed first stage the 18th refly of a 1st stage the 1st rerefly of a 1st stage and the 64th falcon 9 launch  so half of all f9 launches will now have resulted in a landing future bro
stupid nro if it werent for them this would be a rtls launch
  explore stuff at or before the point where the probe would get passed up by newer designs     dont be overly ambitious going to another star in current year is overly ambitious currently so we dont do it
so are we gonna have one longass deployment stream with it blomping out 64 minisats all night long cause thats kinda cool
  thats what i was thinking too
  this is because they dont want to risk important hardware and infrastructure for pointless pr stunts involving rocket landings of all things
  saving money is bad
who /hype/ here another nail in the coffin for expendable rockets
  reusable rockets are a complete waste of time
  but not a waste of money
  ok
spacex press kit     youtube livestream link

lots of space shit this week  thanks scott manley i guess gosh im retarded  how do you guys keep up with space news
  i watch scott munley and everyday soistronaut they pretty much cover everything
  follow jeff foust jonathan mcdowell nsf chris etc on twitter
    i absolutely love how fucking dirty it is
  your a dipshit if you believe outer space exists and that were not on a flat plane
  according to elon they are scorch marks and not soot technically
  ill believe him rp1lox burns pretty clean right
  virgin expendable rocket    vs    chad flight proven rocket
hmmm mr steven is puttering out right now fairing catch attempt
  for probes you dont just send them  for human manned trips wait until the technology advances to a point where you can make the trip in under the mean time for a significant advantage to appear and then send  obviously you dont want to send people on a 20 year cryosleep trip to an exoplanet and then 10 years later finish technology that reduces the trip time to 5 years  it would be an impressive troll though
  more like they cleaned the soot off but you cant clean scorch marks off only strip and repaint and its not worth it
  kek after like 5 or 6 flights these first stages will be black as fuck
  blacked
called off retry on the 3rd
  stop keking me elon reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
hope this thing doesnt knock into one of the micro sats when it decouples
    do you think they delayed it to give mr steven time to get into position for fairing recovery
  na they said it was for checks on the second stage
i hope this one explodes again so the we can put an end to this antispace pr campaign    critical times are coming for important space programs and we cant allow public perception to be diverted from traditional well proven engineering to some scifi pr campaigns
  i secretly hope all rockets explode

rumors of crashed dragon test article following severe parachute failure  delays already confirmed by nasa admin    and fanboys were saying spacex will take the flag from the iss instead of boeing  a corporation that literally has decades of space experience i cant wait to see your tears and excuses hahahahaha
  proof
  anon why are you replying
  usatoday article administrator of nasa  january is a very low probability  attributed the delay to parachutes  just few days after stating 7th for the launch    destruction of the test dragon so far unconfirmed besides through unofficial channels  all i can say is muskrats utterly destroyed    mmuh mars in 2035  lmao
  im not seeing any sources for this  its no secret that nasa has some concern with spacexs parachutes and that theyre working on it but spacex next parachute test is supposed to be a launch abort test so i dont know where this test youre talking about is coming from
  january is a very low probability  attributed the delay to parachutes  yeah this is hardly news
  everyday soistronaut  i bet youve got gyno from even watching that
  yeah pretty much man but he does have good info and analysis
  somewhat  he kept getting mixed up doing the insight landing saying shit that could easily make a viewer believe that there was zero delay in the data coming from the lander did a poor job trying to explain the 78 minutes of terror and some other stuff  he gets most of his accurate information from his discord and he does want to give accurate information so im not going to harass him too much for mistakes but you got to keep in mind that if he is talking about something he is less familiar with then he probably hasnt had time to go over it with his discord group and theres gonna be more mistakes in it
  bonk
  
  more like that one asteroid rendezvous mission which has something happening soon
  elon cocktease musk
  they run it fuel rich though to help with cooling so they do make a lot of soot
  that seems kind of dumb to me but if your engine cant handle stoichiometricsp burn its probably better than running it lox rich you ever seen steel burn i have
  most if not all engines cant handle stoic ratios the choice is always fuel rich or engine rich
  interesting  i know hlox engines burn with extra hydrogen because it results in higher exhaust velocities
  part of the reason theyre developing raptor for bfr is that methane burns cleaner than kerosene and doesnt coke up the engine so much making it easier to reuse them
  it is also easier to manufacture from elemental or simple ingredients easier to purify and doesnt it give better performance
  better than kerosene but the primary is the ability to manufacture the fuel beyond earth kerosene bfr would also work but will be limited to earthonly and maybe moon operations and that naturally introduces the need for separate vehicles for all the martian mission requirements will likely look quite a bit different too due to fuel density and the implications on reentry aerodynamics
steve in position
  parachutes  its nasas fault they couldnt use the superior propulsive landing
these launch threads have had a lack of grimes as of late  we truly are in the best timeline    15 hours till launch then another 24 for crs16
  grimes is a fucking nutjob but im pretty sure she is encouraging his rampant twitter shitposting so i cant be too mad
  her lack of grammar on twitter is infuriating im sure he help elons mental stability somewhat if you put two crazy people together they usually get less crazy over time
f9 is vertical again    meanwhile the 100th orbital launch of 2018 is happening tomorrow morning soyuz ms11 with a canadian american and russian onboard  
  im watching it
  whats superior about it exactly
  pin point accurate landing quick retrieval of timesensitive experiments without waiting on sea recovery probably easier capsule reuse too since they dont have to worry about salt water exposure
  does nasa even want capsule reuse
  they dont want to use or reuse anything
  no crew dragon capsules that fly crew will not be reused for crew missions but will instead be used for crs missions
couple hours left before the steam starts      which makes sense there will only be a couple of spacex crew missions a year
she sexy
heh
  you can listen to the poland sat if if youre a ham nerd and win a prize    
  how do you guys keep up with space news    nasaspaceflightcom is all you need
look at those legs  theyve been used before alright
soyuz docked osirisrex arrived at bennu spacex launching crs16  ariane launch tomorrow good couple days for spaaaaaaaace
why they not land at landing zone  im pretty sure they could given its leo
  nro/ula is worried that if the returning booster fucks up the debris will destroy their fancy nro satellite and fat delta iv which are out at the ula facility right now in other words ula a shit
  so do they cover the extra cost of sending a fleet at sea to recover the booster or is spacex being nice
stream is live
  did they ever manage to actually retract them like they planned or are they still disassembling and reassembling them
  habbiding
        music started       spacex is being nice its not ulas fault spacex had to delay so that there was this conflict
  better music for waiting  
  weve yet to see a booster fail to land on land  just saying
  theyve been doing tests with a new solar powered teslamotor powered retraction thingy
shut it down
  wut
  so iot cubesats are now encouraging terrorism hmmmm
seeing as the asds is closer to shore this time do you think we might actually get an uninterrupted stream of the landing for once
  hiber is launching small cubesats for iot connectivity for a few bucks a year you can sign up and send 144 byte data packages to their sats from practically anywhere in the world with super small antennas pretty neat
  if its 50 km away can you actually see it from the shore
    time to launch 10 minutes
also  no fog  fake as fuck
  i heard its possible if youre at a high enough elevation
  compagnies
  so what is it twitter in space
  the burn but not the landing i think
goooooo steve      just really cheap iot connectivity for fridges buoys whatever
private companies have no place in space
  iot connectivity  fuck this shit for crowding ism band with garbage
  iot connectivity  so in case your fridge is in the middle of the desert or something
  crazy people using twitter as an outlet for their crazyness part 784
we
arms coming off now less than 330 min now
erector is deerecting
literally putting the we wuz kangs meme in space  what a timeline
  wuz
we wuz astronauts and shiet
glad to see the viewer count is just not letting up on those launches  people really are excited for this shit
must be lunchtime in hawthorn can hear forks clinking
shieeeeeet we on fire nigga
that fucking fake egyptian     i dont believe it
tminus 1 minute
no cat pressing launch button poster  where you at
it blew up
spaaaaaaaace
come back baby
good bye booster
im going to reread the ula study stating reusability is economically impossible  meanwhile at spacex   third reflight
wow i think the stage one is actually burning slightly downwards
blue danube starts playing
  that was a really incredible shot of stage separation which has always been beautiful ever since apollo
  over here today 
  bbbut the few months inspection must cost hundreds of millions
  huh thought i was going crazy for a second when i saw that pitch angle
n e a t
  third flight second reflight
  if it was still moving upwards boosting down will make it hit the atmosphere less hard
this is their third reuse of rocket right
  wait why dont they transmit to the main land directly with the feed the drone ship is right fucking there
  related
another perfect landing gotta give it to them
usa usa usa usa usa
  this is the first time theyve used a rocket three times yeah  woooooooooaaaaaa that telephoto shot nice
  nvm they are good people
now that was fucking epic  flat earth confirmed
  fuuuuck that reentry burn
this cant be happening this is impossible this shouldnt be happening
arianespace eating the bullet
now for a fairing catch go steve
  this is all fake green screens and cgi to suck investors money
yfw first fourth flight of a falcon 9 incoming
im so happy they did this kind of landing shot again we havent had one for years
no deployment video
  meanwhile at ula  swimming in 1 billion dollars won from the airforce
  im going to reread the ula study stating reusability is economically impossible    lockheed to boeing we wont try if you dont try  boeing deal
ula on abortion pills
the third launch and landing of this same booster this year    thats pretty intense
  yyou need at least 24 months of refurbishment  itll be ccheaper to just build new ones  wwhat would the workers do if you didnt build rockets  somebody open the windows i cant breathe its like a tomb in here
for a low energy mission like this its probably pretty likely theyre catching a fairing   just gotta keep refreshing elon/spacexs twitter
next launch tomorrow  just wait until sx starts launching their comsats its gonna be fucking insane trying to follow launches
64 satellites on the 64th launch hmmm
the countdown net has new graphics check our the parabola the 1st stage made today       it would have been like 73 but some of the cubesat companies didnt get their fcc paperwork sorted out in time
  ive just to enjoy a coke and some candy/snack when they launch was cool back in 20152016 when there was some time between launches at this rate i might develope type 2 by next summer
imprison this conman already    why america is so corrupt    rockets are dangerous no civilian must have rockets
next step spacex btfo russia and boeing and becomes the sole provider for human space launch
  russia definitely but boeing never too much congressional support and its very likely theyll even delay crew dragons until boeing can win the ctf game
  speaking of which ill stick the crs16 launch thread up in a bit lz1 landing
  right in the middle a perfect landing once again
/sci/ is one of those falcons gonna beat space shuttles in numbers of landings and reflights
  seems like there was some serious vectoring at the last second      makes me think that one day theyll reduce the safety zone size for the rtls landings would be cool to be pretty close to it when the booster comes down statistically if its as safe as landing a plane why not be up close you can sit outside of airports all day
  or you know cst100 could be shit and astronauts ashamed of flying on it  also you training for it would mean youre stuck with their production line
  would need to refly 40 times to beat discovery i think
  did any shuttle ever launch thrice in one year though
  yep 
one answer we never got is how much reentry wrecks engines and how much of them were actually reused  id kill for that statistics and so would a lot of people in the industry
  it would need to do only 11 missions to beat challenger
  i think that theyve stopped pulling engines now the first couple block 4 reuses sometimes had new engines here or there but nowadays they just do some inspection and thats it after all the boosters dont go back to hawthorn for engine swaps they can do the referb at the launch sites in the integration facilities/storage buildings     and the engines are certainly dirty enough to be the originals ones
  well for all we know they could have only saved the tanks from the whole thing and dirtying an engine with sooth would be easy  are you sure some of them didnt go back to hawthorne
    i think that 4 times a year was a record
  huh guess i underestimated the shuttle in that regard
  spacex is learning and is the only one doing it proper currently space shuttle required full refurbishment of their engines so the damage would be considered extensive
  and dirtying an engine with sooth would be easy    behold the absolute state of oldspace shills in these trying times
  well technically it wasnt the whole vehicle the most important part that took the whole thing in the sky always burned in the atmosphere shuttles were just glorified capsules
  nah im pretty sure that theyve yet to replace an engine for block 5 boosters some nsf forum autists are keeping track on l2 i think  consider  each engine is fired like three times before launch to begin with then another fire before the reflight the bathtub curve of reliability is a thing    so b10463 merlins have probably 8 burns under their belts
  oh im really not but this is unknown data  im sure some engines take a serious hit after a few launches and are replaced  the question is what percentage
    there was a 4engine booster spotted but i forget why it only has 4 or which core it was
  those engines are sturdier than you think the biggest problem is that before spacex there was no way to actually recover them and reuse
  launch profiles are a factor as well  did you see the night launch with balistic reentry profiles  that shits ablating as fuck
  and dirtying an engine with sooth would be easy  wew lad
  are you sure some of them didnt go back to hawthorne  are you high  how the fuck do you think spacex would hide that its a fucking rocket especially at hawthorne where people are looking all the time for new booster sightings
  so what do you do for a living  i drive rockets around
  atleast one of the merlin engines had debris intake that was causing some fluctuations in one of their static tests so this problem has been known for a while either they have made iterative changes since then to rectify this issue or they accepted this possibility given that they use many small engines a few losses is acceptable
  tinfoil hat on i guess  its not likely at all but maybe theyre just throwing their engines away
  for that booster they moved the integration of some engines to texas since they test them down there anyway
press folk got some good footage from land      plus police escorts pretty often must be a comfy job even if any mistakes result in a 40 million dollar rocket being damaged
  inb4 eco terrorist destroys one of those
  dont forget the micro cracks in the engine bells or whatever that issue was think theyve fixed it though it was mentioned in a nasa comcrew report
  holy shit the earth was round after all who couldve known
  wtf is this
  turbo pumps nasa made a lot of noise about that supposed issue despite the shuttle engines having it as well
  wait how could they film a rocket landing 50 km away if the earth is spherical  its all a fucking hoax i tell you
update in 30 min  posted 35 min ago    stage 2 must have exploded oh no mission failure rip spacex   f
they are going to disassemble this rocket and science the shit out of it they need data about each part this one aint gonna fly no more
  why  do you expect anything to go differently after a 3rd flight compared to a second  i say its gonna fly 4 times and more hopefully
  the difference between two flights and three flights probably arent that bad the whole point of block 5 was that they fixed the shit on block 4 that needed to be replaced b5 cores should be good for 10 flights before maintenance     imo they should just keep throwing cheapo payloads on b1046 and fly it until it explodes give the customers a discount or whatever
  this way itll take a decade until they hit 10 on a rocket
  cst100 not flying is actually beneficial since it will make the sls and orion even more important i dont doubt boeing would gladly trade it if the latter is the replacement dont think its a joke sls servicing the station instead of commercial crew was an actual proposal by lobbyists and the idea just like an old lich hasnt died at all and reanimates very easily    first stage vs orbiter quite different
  see here sonny back in my day there would be bingo cards for where boosters landed on the droneships not anymore
  trojan magnum
  sls/orion to the iss  there would be riot on the street if nasa wasted money for this  maybe if they bring a new module with them
    this articles really making the shuttlefags reeeeee they fail to remember that the shuttle was a space plane that required expendable rockets and a fuel tank to reach orbit not a rocket itself
is falcon 9 the most successful rocket currently flying i could think only of soyuz
  its looking good  whats funny is at the rate theyre going its only gonna take spacex a few years to surpass ula/russia in the reliability statistics
  yep f9 is just as reliable as ariane is cheap and can throw shit into a multitude of orbits it really only lacks good c3 numbers or something like that      partly expendable rockets that cost more to refurb than building a new one lol
deploy confirmation
  ironically had the shuttle stack wasnt tied to the shitty orbiter it would have been pretty useful on its own even if expendable
  wasnt there supposed to be 64 small satelites
  yeah if they went the energia route it would be a monster for big shit to leo
  c3  just throw a falcon heavy at it  they still have to recover center core from it but they only had 1 try and it was close  actually its amazing how spacex has managed to not loose any booster since forever if you dont count fh  in fact theyve been spending most of the last year throwing away stages they didnt need  theyre gonna build a fleet in no time
  deployment happens in different phases for different parts of the spaghetti stack  
  if you want kaboom wait for the pad abort test theyre destroying the 1st/2nd stage on purpose    at the point of breaking up the stages would be carrying the following approximate fuel loads of lox and rp1   stage 1 lox 631300 pounds   stage 1 rp1 257500 pounds   stage 2 lox 168100 pounds   stage 2 rp1 65000 pounds   the extra lox carried as ballast for the abort test would provide an environment that is oxidizer rich and would promote combustion of the remaining rp1
  yeah i miss my esplosions
  yfw the abort will be used as example of disastrous failure by shills and shitposters  if there are hitpieces we might even get some politicians to mention it as they did the engine explosion
  yfw boeing doesnt need to abort test
  simulations are just as good as physical data good goy   hmm testing a new atlas config nah we dont need to
  yfw its considered a good thing and a sign of experienced engineering and traditional aerospace knowledge
  its funny how spaces just have some boosters worth millions of dollars just lying here and there to blow them up
  well spacex does
  inflight abort pad test has already happened
  at what altitude are they destroying the rocket
  ok just curious  are they just maybe gonna try recovering this booster in case it survives separation at maxq  the dropoff from maxq is very fast especially if you shut down engines  booster should be full of fuel  more than enough to stear it at apogee if it doesnt flip 180 at sep  just saying
fairings didnt make it    god damn steve get your shit together
  in the fcc doc    says that they tried to find a flight profile that could result in saving the stage but nothing would work     spacex originally considered recovering the falcon 9 first stage booster during the abort test by conducting a boostback and landing at lz1 however due to the abort test mission parameters requiring dragon separation at max q spacex was unable to create a trajectory that would allow boostback and landing similarly spacex evaluated having the first stage relight after dragon separation and fly further out in the atlantic ocean either for a droneship landing or impact with the ocean 124186 miles offshore issues with achieving approval for flight termination qualification after the dragon separation event proved impossible for these options
which one of your nerds is replying to /ourguy/ jeff foust about the motherboard shuttle shaming     i know its one of you
  i hope spacex are going to do what they should have done in the firstplace make the fairings waterproof much less cooler but far more practical than the net
  thats dependent on the ocean being calm though theyll catch em eventually
  its me you can tell because its basically a copy paste of this 
  what i take from this is it was close to being doable  if they smart they dont autodestruct it so medias dont get their clickbait
  but the boosters were reused  its only the orange tank that went to waste
  either way the media gets to clickbait the fuck out of the in flight abort test  spacex booster explodes 90 seconds after launch  article image booster exploding
  are you sure theyll trigger fts after sep  i dont see a reason why  so they might let it drop in the ocean
  cutting something up replacing 90 of it heavily refurbishing the sections that made it and reassembling while having it cost twice as much as just building a new one doesnt really count as reuse
  from the report  the baseline autonomous flight safety system would be used with destructors on both stages deviations from the crew configuration include no pyrovalve for thrust termination on the second stage the qualified version of the safety system at the time of the abort test would be used
  if you read about the processes involved they basically rebuilt the recovered boosters and only reused some salvageable segments of the orings it was actually found to be more expensive to rebuild the boosters than build them from scratch
  just guessing  we wont get a live stream will we
  really makes you think why they kept on doing it
  it will be livestreamed according to spacex    the launch timeline will be funny  and now were coming up on some events in short succession maxq followed by a gigantic explosion
  meh it will be crs7 all over  i just hope they dont pack a real 2nd stage in this mission that should never happen
  the 2nd stage will be partially plumbed but will lack an engine bell and some other bits
  sx decided this was a good idea back in the days  back in the days where they didnt know how strong retards would go against them at the slightest sight of weakness  its actually not a requirement but they told nasa theyd do it to prove their vehicle
  fucking drone ship dude
  that mission is heavily advertised as an abort test theyll say its a deliberate destruction of the booster
  but wouldnt it be below the horizon  it looked like that camera had a 100 km more to give
  congressmen will still be surprised it exploded
droneship 50 km away  why did they bother  they should have landed it in the fucking port
  nro has a very expensive very spoopy payload over in ulas chunck of vafb they complained about the possibility of debris hitting it if a rtls landing occurred
  but the port is not in the airforce base
  srbs have most of their cost in the propellant unlike liquid boosters another example of very bad decision making going on in the design driven by politics and propaganda rather than cost analysis and good engineering
  yeah we all know rtls is risky  it literally failed 0 times since sx has been landing boosters  also it has contingency failsafe until very late in the landing burn  its literally aiming wrong until a few seconds before landing
  good god sow much of an autist can you be to argue about that shuttles were just a payload of the rocket not the rocket itself
  half of california goes into a frenzy each time one of those things flies at nighttime so my expectations are kinda jaded
  can we trust spacex with the lives of our american astronauts when they had one of their rocket explode mid flight recently  let us not also forget this is the company who lost a very valuable american satellite just few months back and even another one during a very dangerous explosion on the pad while fueling the rocket with a dangerous unproven and very dangerous experimental procedure they wish to use even for the manned flights with american astronauts on board the rocket  america needs safe assured access to space and this is why nasa has been developing the largest most powerful and safest rocket system ever made the space launch system  it is important to note the space launch system has had no launch failures whatsoever and is all american made and the largest most powerful rocket ever designed  being the largest most powerful rocket ever designed american mad rocket the space launch system is the only launch system that can provide safe and assured american access to space and will even make possible the construction of an actual american space station around our very moon  usa usa usa  sls sls sls
  congress circa few months from now
  yeah i wouldnt even surpised  lets launch sls to the iss holy shit  arent you impressed
  spacex probably wanted dod good boy points for doing a asds landing they want as many nro missions to come their way and nro is probably still slightly salty after zuma even if it wasnt spacexs fault
  i cant even remember when it was they didnt land a booster except fh core booster  holy shit can you
  what happened with zuma  did dod fuck up and blame it on spacex
  and the issue with main booster of fh was such a stupid issue too they just run out of ignition liquid
21 hours until another spacex launch
  official unofficial story is northrop grumman messed up with their custom detachment mechanism for the sat and it was deorbited along with the upper stage during its scheduled debris clearing maneuvers at the end of the flight it literally got where it should and failed to separate had they used the normal spacex stuff it might have actually worked but you know how secrets work  that or it was all a cover story but the shit thrown around by the likes of wapo and some congressmen does not support that theory
  the other theory is that the mission was full success but they wanted to cover it up so no one is looking for spy satelite
  so it should be traceable who got fired from dod at this time
is retro propulsion gonna be more reliable than shuttles landing you are not gonna build civilization on mars if the booster exploads once in 50 flights
  but you are  people will die for various reasons booster esplosion being one of them  its not a free ticket to a new life  its a ticket to adventure however shit it may turn out
  not many alternatives in places beyond our own planet parachutes and airbags are quite limited and not very recommended for use on anything big or fleshy    going horizontal also puts some structural requirements on the vehicle and complicates things with the only gain being landing on runways on earth that is rather pointless i think unless you really like the space plane aesthetic
  a shuttle is useless on mars  those wings would only somewhat incresas the drag coefficient and be a weight pain  i dont like bfs having more wings even though sx must have computed it was more safe to have it despite the payload lost
  the wings double as the landing legs so really theyre getting the best bang for their buck by using the legs to slow velocity on descent
  depends if they can fix the rodent food mold problem might be a delay
looking at cst100 cg launch animation  it doesnt have a launch escape tower  mmmh
  im thinking even if zuma failed to reach orbit theyll still want to make it look like a cover up so that anyone tracking spy satellites will waste time looking for a sat theyre never going to find drawing some attention away from the existing spy sats
    i live right by vandenberg and i was on the 166 going to my solar job in cuyama at 4 am and one of these trucks and a fuck load of police ran me off the road
crs16 thread is up 
  eventually youre going to need to stop making individual threads for launches and itll just become spacex general and then itll all go to shit
  i think consistent weekly launches is probably enough for me to stop making threads but thats a bit of ways away
scientifically speaking how do i fall asleep right now i have a really important business call in the morning and ive slept 6 hours in 3 days
  the first step is to blank your mind to do this its recommended you relax all of the muscles in your face then drop your shoulders and relax your arms breathe out and relax your chest and then also relax your legs all in that sequence    for the next 10 seconds youll then want to clear your mind of everything either imagine youre lying in a pitchblack room on a comfy couch or if youre struggling saying the words dont think over and over again can supposedly help
    i do not sleep usually staying out of rem almost completely i can remember peoples conversations from when i was asleep can tell if someone is in the room etc     i usually focus on thinking about a small pinpoint of light and trying to zoom into it almost as if you were looking at only a keyhole from 50 feet away and you needed to see what was on the other side usually i get to my remless sleep as soon as i get that pinpoint of light to expand    or maybe im not really sleeping and just doing some meme meditation i have no idea but i know im always tired
  find some hypnosis videos on youtube
  just lie down and realize that you are breathing manually be aware of the fact that your clothes are touching your skin and you can feel it realize that every time you swallow you hear a crackle in your ears think about the fact that your tongue is unable to find a comfortable place in your mouth

  have a cold shower or have a shower and before you get out slowly turn the hot water off until its cold lay in bed and slow your heart rate you can naturally slow your heart down by exhaling for longer than you inhale it might seem weird at first and dont hyperventilate but doing that breathing exercise will naturally slow down your sympathetic nervous system im surprised no one suggested this    sleep has been directly linked to body temperature and heart rate do these two things     i personally listen to asmr every time i sleep and i have been for over a year now if you arent used to it though it might not work

what age is sex drive at its peak and from when on can we expect it to significantly decline
    im 37 and so far i find it to be mostly mood dependant for me    jerked off twice today   also im not /fit/ by any standard just skinny and try to eat healthy emphasis on try
  sex drive is driven by behavior and reinforcement it has only increased as i aged if it was only hormonal this makes zero sense
  abstinence increases the hormone production
  for both sexes the late teens and early 20s test peaks around 2225 and declines noticably at the end of your 20s and early 30s female fertility peaks between 1925 and it becomes progressively more likey to miscarry beyond that point menopause begins around the of middle age and estrogen plummets during this period
please tell me why my white penis is so small and why black guys have such huge dicks    its not fair black guys fuck all the hot chicks in my area and when i manage to get a woman every one in a while she seems very disappointed with the size of my white peepee after having a history of fucking black guys     fuck being white
  its a porn myth not real
16 is peak libido think back when you were that age    t medfag
weve all heard the theory of physically peaking on average at around 25 at least for men im 23 so i could possibly conduct some selfscience blood test every year to check t levels obviously not the only relevant factor though may prove interesting i hypothesize that true peak is closer to 30  pic semirelated

  cope
  are you implying one necessarily preceded the other that they couldnt have came about contemporarily with the first multi cellular organism its as if people assume human ancestors must have been too incompetent to ever possibly figure out which plants they could eat and couldnt so that they must have subsisted almost entirely on animals
im 29 and i only feel like jerking off every 2 or 3 days i used to jerk off 1 or 2 times a day    is such a decline normal this early
  this study is literally based on self reported measurements were supposed to believe muh dik is the one thing niggers wont lie about
  most women dont even want to get close to a nigger let alone touch one quit going for fat chicks
  for what its worth one of my best friends works as a producer in the porn industry he says its almost impossible to find white guys that are as big as black guys    for every horse hung white guy like danny there are 20 other black guys just as big or bigger dredd shane diesel rico strong lexington steele mandingo etc
  danny d
  porn industry    yeah im sure your (((friend))) doesnt have an agenda or anything
  dredds dick is fucking monstrous im surprised he can even fit that thing in any woman without killing her
  for about a weak then testosterone remains constant the only thing that really changes with prolonged abstinence is that serum dht levels can decrease which does make sense in light of the oxytocin and 5αreductase relationship
    yeah because only black men would lie about the size of their dicks    goddammit /pol/ why are you always the retard
  tfw youre big enough that you would dickmog basically any man from most of the world except for in niggerland and even then would be considered about average
    reading your post is the reason why your selected sexual partners are turned off by you the suggestion that girls rejecting their parental direction and engaging in bestiality is irrelevant to this discussion get some fucking confidence
  18 and 25
  yes only niggers would lie     im white married and dont watch jewish pornography that is nothing more than a weapon against white society i dont really care about muh dik this is how the majority of normal whites without a cuck fetish from watching too much porn think    quit letting schlomo live in your head rent free
  dude youre a fucking psycho stop spending so much time on /pol/ and stormfront
  being psycho isnt a bad thing for example check em
  so investigate dickhead
  how the literal shit do you memorize porns do people actually watch that trash also the hung white guys are busy having actual careers mostly i 100 guarantee it
  reminder that 6 inches is the ideal penis size long enough to fill her up and be visually impressive not too long or girthy that you cant ever fully insert or that shell at first have difficulty taking it      sounds more like the modern result of various forms of pollution  this whether actual or psychological i have a lot of psychological pollution and my sex drive never really reaches any heights theres no hook if im jerking off and starting doing something else it just goes away
  stop spending so much time watching cuck porn you cockslurping turbofaggot
  do you believe in evolution    believe   evolution    fuck off
    are fossils science
  tips  well said fellow gentleman
    yeah linking pictures of fat guys in fedoras somehow invalidates decades of research
i wish the sex drive peaked much later than it actually does i dont understand why evolution determined it to peak so early in life    with sex drive peaking at late 30s much of the population with genetic abnormalities would die before they could produce offspring and the genome would be much more stable with significantly less population

big universities sometimes enable weird beliefs like for some reason princeton has an ongoing project where they claim phacking random number generators is meaningful not as a hoax to demonstrate how easy it is to mislead with statistics its a serious thing      dudes sitting/levitating in a room meditating are invincible to terrorism  its true though if they levitate high enough and move fast enough how will the terrorists get to them

   that injecting stem cells into his blood stream is going to do anything  wwwredditcom  cosmetic applications of stem cells is nothing new and is entirely understandable if you have a high enough iq to understand why   ttheres no evidence for that  hes smart enough to realize how doing that could benefit of course there isnt going to be a study conducted on healthy people using stem cells for individual enhancement its controversial enough using them to treat disease let alone just taking them to enhance the human condition   if i had access to stem cells i would take them
  well its just that string theory and the guts are pseudoscience s
  stem cells are low risk with potentially huge upside theres little reason not to take them assuming money isnt an issue
  low risk with potentially huge upside  so is accepting christ as lord and saviour just because there might be an upside just doesnt make it the best decision to take

am i fucked  im panicking
  yeah you can but hurry
lmao so many people on /sci/ are struggling with linear algebra
yeah its easy dont stress anon
  i have to review most of general vector space the night before the exam and i am currently trying to finish dimension row/col space and null space i am not panicking but i am not in a good spot hopefully youre not a moron like me but you still wont be able to get more than a 60 if you manage to do it good luck
  can i study linear algebra in 3 days  why dont you try it and find out
  i keep procrastinating and doing unrelated browsing    earlier i threw the book out of the balcony  what the fuck are vectors  i get the algebraic rules but are the arrows  polynomials  most of the proofs are over my head
  good luck  thank you
  id like to know if it can be done first  why even bother if its impossible  you seem low iq
  i keep procrastinating and doing unrelated browsing  yeah thats the issue    why do you only have 3 days
just talk about how a vector space is really just a module over a field you will impress your prof trust me
theres also the 3b1b video series on the essence of linear algebra    it wont teach you everything but it goes over the basic ideas fairly quickly
  why do you only have 3 days  i had more time but i cant bring myself to sit down and study  even when i manage to do it my mind races and cant sit for more than 30 min
well im going for a walk with the book and sit down when i come back  this time could work since i have so little time left
  dudester ymb always your done
  linear algebra is literally highschool brainlet shit youll be alright just watch out for the rational expressions/polynomials with limits and horizontal/vertical asymptotes
your best hope is to faint on the way to your exam in a public area of your college to get your exam postponed for you barring that youre pretty fucked unless you study 16 hours a day on stimulant in the hopes of a c or b
lol no just drop the course my dude
  cant tell if trolling
  thats thats not what linear algebra is
durr hurr durr hurr look at me im retaded    its not a real thread      its another /sci/ is lower iq than /lit/ episode
  if its not a real thread then how am i replying to it
  what the fuck are vectors i get the algebraic rules but are the arrows polynomials  if youre not joking and unless you get rid of all distractions and study the for the next three days with few breaks then youre fucked a vector is merely an element of a vector space a polynomial is a function of the form px  axn  bxn1    c where abc are elements of some field generally r have fun studying op     that isnt linear algebra you fucking highschooler
for each hour of class you attend you need study at least 4 times that number of hours to learn that subject properly  4 hours a week of some class study at least 16 hours of that subject at home to learn all was given during the week and not suffer the snowballing effect of weeks of classes  this is the method i use to study and that makes me able to give a little time to my hobbies
    another important thing the more you study a little bit everyday things get easier and easier to understand and you get the state of truly have fun solving problems
  for each hour of class you dont attend you need study at least 4 times that number of hours to learn that subject properly  lectures  assignements always worked for me not paying attention is what made things painful
    just go to walmart and buy yourself some 150 wireless headphones similar to apple are airpods  charge them full before test  lookup cheat sheet for linear algebra  record said cheat sheet into your phone with a free app  put app playback on repeat play airpods while taking test    unlike most people think the best thing to do in life is cheat because if you arent someone else is and simply put youre at a disadvantage there are no morals in a capitalist society so get over that right now

a genie appears before you he offers you intelligence beyond imagination a boost to 200 iq in exchange you will never be able to make a solid shit again you will have to spend at least 3 hours of every day experiencing painful diarrhea that no medical advance will ever be able to cure or even alleviate do you take him up on the offer
  i would need more information to make this decision  for example is my 3 hours all at once or spread out throughout the day 3 hours of projectile shitting in the morning would be reasonably manageable exploding into my pants every 20 minutes all day long would not be  also depends on severity of pain mildly uncomfortable normal diarrhea is one thing unbearable bowelcancer tier shits are another    if it was 3 hours of ordinary diarrhea in a contiguous block i would agree otherwise no
  lets say it is variable along a somewhat standard distribution where most of the time it is predictable uncomfortable diarrhea but sometimes it is more painful random and intense and sometimes it is easier
  i think i would say no to that  deciding factor is whether or not it can be managed enough that its not a total disability and the way youre describing it it basically is
well my issue isnt intelligence its not being a piece of shit with no willpower addicted to my computer screen
  same here why do i keep shitposting on this stupid website 
  in my case because i have no other firms of social interaction
  if it gives me the ability eradicate all degenerates like op mercilessly and immediately were talking hundreds of millions of pedos and chair sniffing subhumans vaporized within a few weeks of my intelligence boost then sure no dead weebs no deal

how does something become from nothing    explain how the fuck does big bang make any sense
it comes from infinite mathematical potential    the real world is just a huge illusion matter is just math/energy aka the matrix

  why was it packed so tightly   how does that make any fucking sense   what created it
  just yell god did it when you dont understand things its easier that way
the big bang isnt a creation theory it just says that a finite amount of time ago everything was really close together and then it exploded outwards and is still expanding at a constant rate we can tell because of the cmbr
  correction it didnt expand outwards because that would require some sort of orientation it just expands
  but if god created it then what the fuck created god    there must be something that made all this shit
  not with logic i cant but check out the principle of polarity
  for nonexistence to exist is absurd existence exists necessarily all that we see is only the fulfillment of a pure existence    there is nothing  this makes no sense there should be something   what is something pure existence  but what is pure existence  it has the potential for all the forms of existence  is it a potential how can it change  it doesnt change all forms already exist
  the big bang was not the beginning of the universe it was just a significant event in that restructured the universe the only reason why the current cosmological theory draws a blank for anything before the big bang is because we dont yet have a theory of quantum gravity something didnt come from nothing its more like everything came from really weird shit we dont understand yet
  but how does anything exist it must have became from nothing
  there cant be nothing the matter was always there it was not created by anything or anyone
  there was never really nothing  it just wasnt expressed in the physical matter we are most familiar with
  how can always exist 
  and then it exploded outwards and is still expanding at a constant rate we can tell because of the cmbr  at a constant rate  but thats where youre wrong
  yes its actually accelerating  remains to be seen not by any of us if gravity will overcome this acceleration
  branes created it
  sentience existed before the universe did thats as much i will tell you
  quantum fluctuations n shit
  it isnt at a constant rate tho  different areas of space spand at different speed
  you cant have nothing without having everything  here lawrence krauss explains a universe from nothing with 0 total energy  
  the universe didnt come from nothing it came from a sub planck singularity that contained all the energy that would ever exist in the universe as this singularity expanded it cooled down allowing this energy to condense into quarks then when it cooled down further quarks could group together forming protons and neutrons another particle that was flying around was the electron it cooled even further allowing electrons to link with protons creating the first element hydrogen then helium these enormous masses of hydrogen and helium clumped into the first supernovas creating elements beyond those two as time passed the distances between matter masses increased creating galaxies
  youre looking for an answer but the truth is no one fucking knows or ever fucking will probably so shut the fuck up and just accept that sometimes theres just a massive fucking question mark for an answer youre looking for
  energy  quantum particles  hadrons atom components  atoms  molecules  everything more complicated
  gods mother
  i see you dont like to engage in conversation
    0  1  1    now we just have to figure out where all that antimatter went
  there is only one state and its a time torus
  well you presume that it came from nothing  but there cannot be nothing  there must be something    there is also the possibility the big bang never happened a flawed physical model perhaps simply existing forever  or there is no time without the observer the observer gives birth to all that is and is eternal himself
  karma surfing
    wibble wobble and then there was light
  but where did the laws come from that allowed this to take place
  see    
  when was there nothing
  the laws that built our universe are a bit of a mystery if they were different we wouldnt exist  its possible that in an infinite realm of possibility we exist in this one because we can  a natural selection of universes
  its not the philosophical nothing  its the vacuum of quantum foam  
  imagine being this dumb  0  1 1  do the math
  not him but     imagine time is like an infinite sticky note flip book with an infinite cartoon drawn in it it goes back forever and goes forward forever the past is not destroyed when you flip pages and the future already exists    the point you perceive as now moving forward making you ask when did it start is an illusion you perceive the flow of time because your mind is the result of and is trapped in causality you cant think backwards in time you cant think frozen in time you cant skip around you think in the order thats provided for you    and at this moment there are infinite instantiations of you experiencing your life at all points you are alive like someone flipping that flip book one page behind you and ahead of you for every page eternally    hope your life is based
  reading this while high  fuck you man
  every moment in time exists simultaneously and will recur eternally as all choice is illusion  with that said i hope you all will choose to have a wonderful life
   are you saying were basically immortal
  lmao
  one thing we know about himhes mysterious so we shouldnt ask such questions
  how does something become from nothing  we dont know there are people that assert the claim but its purely speculative
this knowledge would kill you
  some things are probably beyond our brains we are primates with brains designed for problem solving how to get food its amazing how much weve come to know but its not unreasonable to posit we are constrained by a particular biological structure and simply cannot understand ideas of universal construction qualia and more lets see if transhumanism helps
  the idea of being a universal infinite sentience seems like absolute hell to me on a big mushroom trip i momentarily believed all the world was a dream and i was a timeless subjective and that was all the universe was it was terrifying an absolute nightmare the idea of there being noone else nothing else and no relief of an end
  there is absolutely zero evidence for eternal recurrence or universal oscillation that said if it were real its not that we are immortal it goes a bit beyond typical descriptions of time essentially its just the same events for eternity but happening only one time as time reverses and it plays out again almost like a stasis the life you are living now wont happen in a billion years so to speak instead you are currently living a life that stretches out eternally
  on a big mushroom trip i momentarily believed all the world was a dream and i was a timeless subjective and that was all the universe was it was terrifying an absolute nightmare  ive had exactly the same experience and it was awesome a vision of infinite bliss
  didmt they theorize there were 3 or 4 previous big bangs
say that an infinitecimaly small pocket of space exists  its so tiny it kinda doesnt make sense to talk about it as space as in 3/4 dimensional space more of the 0d kind of space  that tiny speck is everything and everything is that tiny speck  one day out of the blue the speck starts growing  a surge of negative energy causes it to expand  as natural a surge of positive energy equal to the negative energy that expanded the space is now found inside the space  the highly energetic vacuum of young universe forces matterantimatter pairs in and out of existance until they get far enough from each other that we cannot possibly see them  they disperse in distance so big that they dont automaticly anihilate and once they form neutral atomic particles they cease the atraction and go their mery way  now there are couple problems with this one  why did it expand this 0 energy speck into a larger 0 energy speck  who knows shut up its probably a property of 0 energy specks to expand into 0 energy universes  where the antimatter  too far away to see even with cosmic microwave background  close to see exactly looks like regular matter but doesnt come enough in contact with matter in order to show visible signs of annihilation  decayed faster than regular matter  some other bologna  how does this make sense  in a sense you got nothing out of nothing   the entire concept of requirement of god can be easily replaced for an inate property of massles energyless spaceless 0 dimensional specks to inflate and expand into vast universes and probably shrink back or expand infinitely into spaceless massles energyles specs of 0 dimensional specks
  how it would never end and is claustrophobic to an existential degree no universe just your mind stretching out across eternity i cant think of a greater horror
big bang theory is just the atheist response to creationism and not a very good one at that
explain to me how were not on the verge of total annihilation if pollinators go we will all die very soon after
everyone spraying pesticides everywhere with no care as to the effects was bound to catch up to us
im more worried about ants
  were fucked in multiple ways were not even aware of yet    good
  its not just pesticides its also habitat loss and climate change we can stop using pesticides but the other two arent really fixable in the short or medium term  france has recently banned a lot of pesticides and the eu has banned the worst of them so well see if insects return there in the next few years but if habitat loss and climate change are enough to be causing this we are truly screwed
  what happens with ants
  you can muddle on for a while without most pollinators its just going to cause steady ecosystem collapse and eventually serious consequences for agriculture fishing air quality water quality flooding quality of life its more fascinating how that sounds like a good deal to most people and the mass extermination of most advanced life forms on earth is considered an acceptable loss especially considering the death of these biomes will eventually make life on earth extremely unpleasant if not unsustainable bird populations and their insect prey are also in freefall as are fish populations and countless other keystone species populations of course you cant shill against this in any meaningful way as its extremely evident to anyone who spends time outside near greenbelts or wooded areas that things are quieter
just ban pesticides more insects and more healthy food so everyone wins
explain it to me like i was braindead  how bad are we talking about
  complete annihilation of higher complexities of life same as if the oceans properties change too much its a critical sink for things in the atmosphere and secondary base of the suppliers of much of the oxygen in the world
societal collapse when
if you want to cry yourself to sleep ask a geobiologist what scares him   were literally teetering on the edge in more ways than one meeting random 2c goals wont do it residence time of co2 is 100 years by the time youve fixed it the minimum carrying capacity for organisms like insects will implode
i wish i had a bigger backyard and garden i live and grew up in a suburban neighborhood and it just looks so awfully bland invasive species everywhere most insects need suitable habitat so why not just grow one in your backyards or rooftops
  is there actually any way to survive this maybe by buying a large piece of fertile land setting up a permaculture and breeding pollinators and other important insects
listening a sad song  reading this thread  we fucked this real hard didnt we anons
  good i fucking hate bugs especially flying bugs   going outside now to spray some fly spray into the air in celebration
  this study is some serious nonsense    if the dates where chosen differently youd get totally different percentages eg the 27 years are 19892016 if you look at the timeframe 19892014 youd get only 23    you cant derive anything with that kind of arbitrary method also this is some seriously sensationalist bullshit and hallmann obviously did this on purpose this is as far from science as it gets
  we are pushing the limits i think if we halted pesticide use and focused on gmos we could get it back but we dont have the political ability to halt it
  are you saying we lost 50 in the last few years
  the crazy thing is the windshield effect i remember going on roadtrios as a kid and the car just being coated in bugs now it basically hasnt happened at all in my subsequent trips anecdotal but spooky af
  its ok anon after ww3 if we survive well have power to do it differently just keep holding on and be the best you can be love ya
  oscillations and shit muh nigga
  even if you modify the timeframe to chose the best possible interpretation were still seeing a catastrophic decline
    me too the windscreen used to get bug splattered not anymore something else you have probably noticed at night when a light was left on outside there would be lots of moths and other night flying insects fluttering around it now sometimes i only see a few sometimes none    some of the small nature reserves i used to visit in my childhood were busy with the croaks of frogs there were spider webs everywhere little crawling critters everywhere flying bugs occasionally you would see a few rodents always lots of birds some fish in the water shrimp etc now its fairly sterile not all the animals are gone but many of them seem to have disappeared and if not gone then their numbers have declined greatly    i talk to people about this and very very few seem to understand the significance of what i am saying they dont really care its of zero interest to them
    first up the damage has already been done what we are dealing with now is damage mitigation    if we could overnight put in place a benevolent world governing body which had the power to enforce environmental protections and which was sufficiently funded to enact environmental restorations it might be possible to turn things around    the cost of this would be manifold and in many more ways than one all nations would have to give up much of their sovereignty in matters of resource allocation and adopt severe restrictions on land and water use their industry and agricultural bases would be subject to stringent controls resulting in many activities and assets becoming unprofitable and worthless    their would be a marked downturn in the standard of living as measured by consumerism particularly in the first world    restrictions on population growth would be necessary first to decrease the rate of growth and then to stabilize the existing population numbers     all of this assumes such measures could be carried out without the upheaval that would result from resulting conflict with social cultural and economic norms we have currently have in other world it would require world wide irresistible dictatorial powers think of it like this no this farmland with its waterways must be restored to natural habitat no you can not have another child no you will not buy a new car no that factory will not stay open no you and thousands like you will not have a job in that industry no you will not eat these imported foods no you will not longer be able to buy cheap electronic goods no you will not be having that overseas trip no you will not grow that crop no you will not consume that product no you will not and a thousand other nos    people will say thats impossible nations an societies will never accept those sort of restrictions especially not overnight not even in a decade    and so anon that is why we are fucked
how long do we have
  forever uncle sam wants you to start up a bee farm
  im not american and lack the resources regardless
  given our lack of action on various environmental issues over the past decades as well as the increasing social unrest and polarization were seeing i think its fair to say that were going to continue doing too little too late theres some hope with the eu banning the worst pesticides now but im pessimistic enough that im thinking about ways of becoming as independent of the globalized system as possible
  the cost of this would be manifold and in many more ways than one all nations would have to give up much of their sovereignty in matters of resource allocation and adopt severe restrictions on land and water use their industry and agricultural bases would be subject to stringent controls resulting in many activities and assets becoming unprofitable and worthless  never gonna happen unless we get a chinese hegemony or something the first lesson of geopolitics is that nations never willingly give up their sovereignity for damn near anything    restrictions on population growth would be necessary first to decrease the rate of growth and then to stabilize the existing population numbers   only on africa even shitty nations like bangladesh nowadays are starting to get belowreplacement fertility levels
  youre thinking on the wrong timescales  more than 75 percent decline over 27 years
  only on africa even shitty nations like bangladesh nowadays are starting to get belowreplacement fertility levels  this combined with chinas experiments in population control are frankly the white pill to this dilemma liberalism has been completely unable to control the birth rates of the populations that it inhabits or whose brains it infests tomato tomato once nonliberal states take their hand at it humanity as a whole will learn how to deal with birthrates     for what its worth as the big liberals involved in africa start to die off they wont be replaced liberalisms aid only goes as far as is necessary to extract resources from africa and the chinese are demonstrating that its far cheaper to just bribe their governments and take the resources themselves once western corporations adopt this model or just defect entirely to china africa becomes a nonissue     either china figures it out and the issue is settled or they cant come up with something and the population just drops to stability life will go on
  more healthy food  actually you mean significantly less food
who else living in a land locked region in the northern hemisphere away from coastal cities bracing for impending doom
  china is also a disgusting authoritarian nightmare ill take liberal degeneracy over the ccp any day of the week
  false dichotomy flag    500 page penalty
  how is it a false dichotomy when youre talking about a scenario with a global chinese hegemony  also this notion that the country whos by far the worlds greatest polluter is going to figure out the solutions is pretty laughable china probably has a greater chance of collapsing than it has of becoming the next superpower in the next few decades
  liberals are the cause of all the problems  we need to consume consume consume  consumerism is good and not the cause of any problems  everything is hunkdydory  it will work itself out  so lets be bloated and content feasting on the worlds vast resources    you are the cancer  your ideology is cancer
  for what its worth as the big liberals involved in africa start to die off they wont be replaced liberalisms aid only goes as far as is necessary to extract resources from africa and the chinese are demonstrating that its far cheaper to just bribe their governments and take the resources themselves once western corporations adopt this model or just defect entirely to china africa becomes a nonissue    are you fucking serious lol
how long have we got    years decades    i need to start preparing for this apocalypse asap any tips im also 15k in debt
  youre on the wrong board friend
  lold
      jesus christ will you retards take it back to /pol/ this fearmongering is stupid
  china isnt going to find a solution because theyre a commune full of treehuggers theyre just the only ones capable of finding a solution because theyre the only ones who even think theres a problem thats the central problem with liberalism there is a finite amount of resources on this planet and eventually humanity has to make a choice about what to do with them or we can bury our heads in the sand and keep gleefully marching off a cliff because consuming makes us feel good these anons    are choosing just that and on one hand you cant really blame them longterm planning is something most people arent very good at which is what fuels this dilemma    the chinese are engaging in the genetic engineering of humans this is china so its going to turn out absolutely terrible for an uncomfortably long period of time but no one else is even trying
  this mostly why nothing will ever get done situation is as bad as people intuit it to be but natural instinct to compartmentalize and to optimism overrule it humans weren built to handle a system like this much less every biome on earth were just going to persevere or work it out is a death mantra but its a lot more socially tenable than panic even warranted panic
  china is also racing to get ai the thing is annihilation may actually be preferable to future where the ccp becomes a global hightech hegemon that controls literally every aspect of your life including your thoughts the social credit system is just a glimpse of that  in any case it may not matter at the rate insects are dying off theres no way china will come up with let alone implement any solutions
  we say that now but we also live in a society where the majority of information we as the public receive on china comes from people who are either the intellectual descendants of kremlinologists or are former kremlinologists there was a time when there was no way china could possibly survive without adopting a parliamentary democracy hell there was a time when there was no way china could survive after mao or tianmen square or any number of things     the inherent white supremacy of liberalism is its greatest flaw and assuming that just because the chinese dont do what we do that they must fail is an incredibly grave act of hubris when china does collapse  and it will everything does  i would be legitimately surprised if it was from something anyone of importance in the west predicted or foresaw
  social credit system  jesus christ its just like that black mirror episode
just require that every farmer also host a bug habitat    or find some kind of food that insects love but rodents hate
  i have no idea if china will win or collapse they have made massive strides and have massive problems  their people are going into massive dept investing in overvalued shit real estate that nobody lives in and where the houses are falling apart cause theyre built by corrupt construction companies who cut every possible corner   they have a huge shawdowbanking bubble  corruption is absolutely rampant  pollution is off the scale and theyll probably have a huge lung cancer crisis 20 years down the road  they have no clean water  theyre brutally oppressing ethnic and religious minorities  their wages and cost of living is rising making it ever more difficult for them to produce the cheap goods that made them rich in the first place  theyre antagonizing just about everyone politically and believe themselves to be superior  theres a huge increase in xenophobic nationalism     im sure theres a lot more to add to that list of course they could overcome all that but this idea of china being an unstoppable juggernaut thats on the verge of taking over everything is patently false at least in the short and medium term
  im also 15k in debt  you forgot to attach that btc address
 warming will cause an increase of insects and bugs   enjoy getting zika and malaria oil shill  in real life insect population is rapidly declining  can global warming shills ever make any accurate prediction jesus christ its quite impressive how consistently wrong they manage to be you wouldnt be able to be so wrong if you tried youd expect them to get something right out of pure chance but zilch nothing yikes
  the damage has already been done  seems like well be fine then since nobody has been impacted in the least
  dont use resources   save them for when the sun swallows the earth  im bery smurt
  just gonna be a correction dont be sad atleast you werent born a peasent in 1000 bc do your best unless you are retarded then party til you die
  idiot
its nice knowing that no matter what i do ill never fuck up this badly
  so far as is known each previous mass extinction has resulted from the arrival of some one major disruptive factor or at most perhaps two or three such factors thus it is widely believed that the dinosaurs were wiped out by the impact of an asteroid that kicked up colossal clouds of dust these obstructed the light of the sun cooling the planet and interfering with photosynthesis presumably mammals were better able to survive under these conditions than the dinosaurs were there are paleontologists who argue that some species of dinosaurs survived for as long as a million years after the impact of the asteroid hence that the asteroid alone was not enough to account for all the extinctions that occurred at the end of the cretaceous the dinosaurs they maintain must have been finished off by some other factorperhaps a prolonged period of unusual volcanic activity that continued to darken the atmosphere in any case no one claims that more than a very few such factorsall of them simple blind forceswere involved in the extinction of the dinosaurs or in other previous mass extinctions    in contrast to these earlier events the extinction event that is now under way is not the work of a single blind force or even of two or three or ten such forces instead it is the work of a multiplicity of intelligent living forces these are human organizations selfprop systems that assiduously pursue their own shortterm advantage without scruple and without concern for longterm consequences in doing so they leave no stone unturned no possibility untested no avenue unexplored in their unremitting drive for power
create robot pollinators
  what always baffles me is that we actually see all this coming yet refuse to do anything substantial about it
  its kind of like when you start having a seizure so you go for a fucking walk
  they all seem to have bunched up in my garden
  ants are useful mostly
  loss of habitat  that doesnt explain why my garden has no bugs in it when in the 90s it was rich with them theres probably 1/10th what there was and there doesnt seem to be any change to the vegetation or regional climate   people ive visited hundreds of km away report the same thing at dusk its silent when for the rest of our lives you couldnt hear each other birds squawking as the sun sets dusk chorus theres no birds because theres no bugs
  its the same deal in my garden its gone done by at least 1/10th the only thing thats changed in the last 15 years is that some properties were subdivided and others had new houses built on them i dont think habitat loss explains this either maybe increased pesticide use does but i dont know  habitat loss comes in when you think about ever increasing urban sprawl and farmland which helps disrupt migration routes makes sense since flying insects are especially hard hit
  good
  i did that 15 years ago and was told wed inevitably be in an apocalypse 8 years ago
hey dont look at me for answers
    its even worse the warnings began half a century ago     go back to the 1960s and 70s and there were plenty of people talking about the impact of things like soil degradation habitat destruction industrial contamination urban sprawl declining water quality over population falling air quality pollution species extinctions etc etc etc and so on    i grew up thinking we lived in a society where we had recognized the need to halt our destructive activities and focus on conservation that smart clever and well meaning people would guide our nations into a harmonious and sustainable future     man was i wrong it got worse as i grew older not better
    as a kid i could go outside into our garden and see hedgehogs sometimes mice plenty of bugs like praying mantis all sorts of beetles lots of caterpillars slugs snails all kinds of spiders aphids ladybugs millions of ants red ones black ones big ones tiny little ones must have been different species plenty of black birds thrushes and swallows and others even an owl on occasions and this was in the middle of a town with a small back section yet it was like a little adventure nature playground for us kids    jesus christ twenty years later and they are nearly all gone
    ants used to be a real problem around our house years ago they were forever getting inside we had to be careful not to leave food out and keep all surfaces clean if you left a biscuit on the kitchen bench overnight by the morning it would be covered in ants    now i would love to walk outside and see them because the little fuckers have all but vanished neighbors have mentioned the same thing
  i wouldnt mind them if those little fuckers didnt cover every remotely useful plant in aphids and build underground nests all over the place
  some years have less insects than others  wet/dry years and mosquitoes for example
  chemtrail hypothesis is suddenly becoming very attractive
  yep i had the same kind of experience i constantly heard about the problems we face and the potential solutions i heard about the amazing success of banning cfcs to save the ozone layer and figured wed solve all these problems cause the world is run by highly intelligent people who are working for a brighter future  there was a thread on /pol/ by a central banker or a very convincing larp by someone in finance that sums up the problem quite well  what have you learned about life working there   that the world is run by people who are very average  the world isnt run by anyone special just a bunch of normal people with ambition and drive theyre too busy looking for advancement and living their lives to deal with a huge host of highly complex issues that would cause a hell of a of boatrocking to really address   the simple fact is that the world is a lot more complicated than it used to be there are constantly more and more issues to know about more technologies and impacts to follow leading to more complex politics with even the most distant nations somewhere along the way the complexity has outstripped normal peoples ability to really understand the world at least without years of directed effort  and then theres the psychopaths people who know the damage their industries do and direct millions and millions of dollars to create fake science and sow doubt so nothing will be done  all the while our ability to influence and damage our world is growing exponentially through technology and gargantuan population growth  now we might still band together and fix the most dire problems in the last minute when things become too obvious and too bad to be ignored but im not exactly optimistic its becoming increasingly likely that were approaching a great filter
educating doesnt work green movements should strive to disrupt society sufficiently so it stops disrupting the environment if any of you think theres a peaceful solution with the billions infesting the earth you are delusional
  id vote for a green party with the tagline go eco green or we make you go plutonium green
  doesnt take a genius to figure out that if you simply salt the skies with metal ions eventually the entire biosphere becomes one massive antenna combine that will subionizing radiation towers and you can make the world play whatever tune you broadcast insects die first their carapaces being most affected by these frequencies as they function as highly sensitive resonance cavities negative synergy at its finest
good i hate bugs and i only eat meat so i dont need flowers
  you know we can grow insects in labs right oh no there are no insects oh no lets genetically engineer some insects to be immune to all the shit thats killing them and release them problem solved
  we have unlimited resources and science is basically like the magic in an elder scrolls game solving all these dire problems is easy  strange i wonder why environmental problems still exist at all
  environmental problems  you dont care about the environment you care about your own survival your environmentalism is totally and utterly selfish in one million years nothing done today will matter    nothing even matters to begin with but dont sit here and try to pretend you arent being selfish
  youre a retard nihilist thats why youve got nothing to add to any conversation beyond it doesnt matter
  you know we can grow insects in labs right  hurr we cant genetically modify insects            just because you didnt know we genetically modify insects doesnt mean we arent doing it nor does it mean i have nothing to add    and youre calling me a retard jesus
    oh and you want to talk about resources                oh no were running out of resources and theres no such thing as asteroid mining    youre a flat out fucking moron
  the ability to genetically modify insects isnt even remotely sufficient how are you going to genetically modify them to resist habitat loss for instance are you going to modify the hundred thousand species of insects continually to keep up with the rapidly changing environmental conditions  you also ignore that mass modification of insects is likely to have unintended consequences because this sort of thing usually does
  asteroid mining is a long way off you really are living in a fantasy land if you think thats going to solve our current problems
  how are you going to genetically modify them to resist habitat loss for instance  first you have to prove that habitat loss is the cause of the reduction  are you going to modify the hundred thousand species of insects continually to keep up with the rapidly changing environmental conditions  this planet doesnt need thousands of insects its nice to have variety sure but we only need bees and mosquitoes  you also ignore that mass modification of insects is likely to have unintended consequences because this sort of thing usually does  thats science fiction link me a single article proving that to be true      you really are living in a fantasy land if you think thats going to solve our current problems  i know how to solve our current problems we use biological weapons to eradicate 90 of all humans or you use thermonuclear weapons to glass half the worlds continents    because we both know the cause of every problem is over population
  measures in summer first and again in winter
  first you have to prove that habitat loss is the cause of the reduction  anon we fucking now that destroying the places requires for a species to live kills that species jesus christ are you just being a contrarian for the sake of it   habitat loss has been a consistent thing that biologist have been warning us about for decades and decades theres literally no question that its a cause
  know
  if we know it then prove it show me the fucking evidence im not going to put my faith in some retard who didnt even know we genetically modify insects    show me your fucking proof you fucking moron
  not one of these articles list habitat loss as the reason you could be the posterboy for the god of the gaps fallacy        
  some retard who didnt even know we genetically modify insects  youre living in a fantasy world anon i never said that you just assumed my position like a total fucking retard  here you go you utter braindead piece of crap              
  jesus christ dude its a well observed phenomeon that habitat loss reduces species numbers and diversity but youre not allowed to put two and two together  nobody is fucking saying that habitat loss is the exclusive cause but that its a highly likely contributing factor along with pesticides and climate change what we dont know is how much of a role each factor plays
its another climate change meme thread  fucks sake cant you niggers talk about anything else
no joke would anyone be willing to move to the midwest and co opt a bunker with me getting a degree in a mech e and would find work in a city
    thats from 1988    this isnt a habitat study its a hantavirus study holy shit    im not checking any further you didnt even read the shit you linked me you linked me a fucking hantavirus study lmfao    youre an actual moron      more than 75 percent decline over 27 years in total flying insect biomass in protected areas  well observed  prove it
  gov  gov  sciencedirect  sciencing  plos  edu    as if onesided garbage is any more credible than any random blogger because they have more views  typical agw priest
    fuck you people are dumb    read this more than 75 percent decline over 27 years in total flying insect biomass in protected areas  protected areas  protected areas  protected areas  protected areas  protected areas  and you still think its habitat related you cant even fucking read
  le gwen le chemtrails  
    lol now they run away and close the thread because they cant admit how ignorant they were    this is why 90 of the human population needs to be wiped out people like you
  nice self dialogue   obvious shill is obvious
  tfw this year has been the worst year in regard to insect numbers    ive never seen a year where theres been so many insects it has been fucking crazy like giant swarms of everything you can name in this area the winters are warmer and not killing them off as much it seems they are more diverse now too since insects from the south are moving up to the now warmer northern areas also fuck those new giant ass mosquitoes that are here now people can barely go outside now because of those shits
kys morrons
  lightning bugs/fireflies made a huge comeback here in the past 10 years too in the 1980s there were tons of them then they started declining to almost nothing now they are nearly the same as they were back in the 80s    pic from earlier this year
  and you still think its habitat related    it is if the temps are no longer the same you cant protect those areas from that type of change
  doesnt think that habitat fragmentation has any effect  doesnt know that insects and birds fly around over huge areas and rely on the ability to do so    it probably does they do
  he doesnt enjoy being slowly poisoned so agrochem companies can profit more
  tfw insects didnt disappear they just evolved to not get hit by cars
  it seems amazing that those who advocate energy conservation havent noticed what happens as soon as some energy is freed up by conservation the technological worldsystem gobbles it up and demands more no matter how much energy is provided the system always expands rapidly until it is using all available energy and then it demands still more the same is true of other resources the technological worldsystem infallibly expands until it reaches a limit imposed by an insufficiency of resources and then it tries to push beyond that limit regardless of consequences    this is explained by the theory of selfpropagating systems those organizations or other selfprop systems that least allow respect for the environment to interfere with their pursuit of power here and now tend to acquire more power than those that limit their pursuit of power from concern about what will happen to our environment fifty years from now or even ten years proposition 2 thus through a process of natural selection the world comes to be dominated by organizations that make maximum possible use of all available resources to augment their own power without regard to longterm consequences
  the people who can do something about it dont want to because its more profitable not to the people who want to do something about it cant do anything more than getting themselves arrested or killed in vain trying to do something
  excellent post thanks
  shit did he actually say that
  miss informed
  
  you might be on to something
  i went outside today and was looking at a nice little fruit tree this single tree had so much going on there was a spider hanging out in his spider web built among the leaves there was a line of ants going down a branch there was a pair of aphid type insects reproducing there were lichens or fungus growing on the tree there were a bunch of flies hanging out on the leaves a wasp was hovering around some leaves so much life on one little tree tree    then i realize most of the area for miles is covered in roads parking lot lawn and suburban house we have protected mangroove forest thankfully but a lot of the land has been ripped away from nature and repurposed for human use look at the us from satellite view in google maps and youll see how little untouched wildlife is actually left
  gentlemen you are on your way to destruction you have no chance to survive make your time
this is why i want to go to mars   rather go to fucked planet and try to make it better than stay here and watch our home burn to the ground because of no willpower to save it
guize we need these insects to pollinate the plants they will all die without them and then we will all die    lol gotta love environmental scientists trying to feel important the challenge is what  find a synthetic way to crosspollinate plants ooo so hard
do we know what specifically is causing this decline i mean id like a deeper answer than just pesticide or climate change which pesticides specifically are to blame why is climate change to blame
  ive noticed that too shitloads of fireflies i grew up in the 90s in rural ny i dont think i saw a single firefly till 2010 now i see lots of them all summer    but ive also noticed a crazy decrease in other species in the 90s there used to be millions of wooly bear caterpillars every summer i saw one last year
  the next saviour of humanity is whoever can rid this planet of 66 billion of us
  killing off a lot of humans
  there are lots of factors expanding infrastructure that destroys wetlands change in temperature and precipitation patterns widespread use and ubiquity of pesticides and herbicides eutrophication of ponds and rivers intensive agriculture and dense populations wreak havoc on the environment in general no single factor can be named which could constitute a fix by changing/removal
    the elephant in the room
  eutrophication  could we fight eutrophication by controlling where runoff from agricultural fields goes maybe by draining into manmade ponds near the field instead of into the watershed this seems like a cheap simple solution who cares how much eutrophication goes on in the drainage pond nothing was ever living there anyways
    its been a well known problem for half a century at least the cost of dealing with it makes the use of applied fertilizers and intensive farming unprofitable    anon all these problems have solutions the problem is the solutions costs money lots of money no one is willing to pay that cost no one is willing to accept the decline in their living standards    do you wear a tshirt made in china anon it probably cost 5 to buy what if i told you the true cost of that tshirt is actually closer to 100 once you factor in the environmental costs of its production and distribution    okay fine you say you are willing to pay 100 for it so we can live clean and green but most people wont    now its not just the tshirt anon its practically everything that has a hidden environmental cost the food you eat the traveling you do your housing everything that you consume take the price you pay for everything and multiply it by a factor of 20 or a number in that sort of magnitude ten times a hundred times does it make any difference its all way too expensive for most people to stomach    lots of people are keen to save the planet until it hurts them in the wallet then they go all quiet and find something else to talk about
  lots of people are keen to save the planet until it hurts them in the wallet  not even just the wallet try to point out how big an improvement just not eating so much meat would be and people go nuts
    yes this    if humanity cant not avoid the j curve then we richly deserve it    and that wouldnt worry me so much except we are going to drag down into obliteration so many other species as well
  then we richly deserve it  my problem is that some portion of humans dont deserve it but theyre not the most likely to survive it
  lets build buildings around farms and put solar panels on the top to power the growlights  usually the easiest way to accomplish something is the best way
  well thats life anon the rich and powerful get everything literally every part of your life is bread and circus
    depends on the exact nature and duration of the event in some scenarios no one survives in less catastrophic scenarios an existing subsistence life style may be of survival advantage to them and their descendants    worse case scenario in my opinion permits the survival of enclaves containing those with the social/cultural attributes that lead to the event in the first place
    in a nutshell its this
  its nice to have variety sure but we only need bees and mosquitoes  ive always wondered this what is the least amount of biodiversity necessary for maintaining the current global population using our current levels of technological advancement we need pollinators bacteria fungi algae and whatever insects and animals help trees grow fish and meat animals are already domesticated and indoor farming is starting to be a thing    this makes polar bears elephants and dolphins kind of useless is there a reason to care about the loss of these species beyond aesthetic preference
  what are cereal crops  what is livestock  please think before posting next time please
  most insects need suitable habitat    leaves left on the ground     but they get removed mulched blown away along with the massive species flowing grasses wildflowers    them comes the fungicide the herbicides chemlawn    underneath the soil layer is interrupted by hardware cloth over the top is spread a noxious mixture of copied woody debris that inhibits regrowth of everything but the must tenacious weeds
    changing patterns of development at the local level is the only chance you have
  yeah but if i dont do all that my lawn i never spend any time on not that i could if i wanted to wont be perfect
    there are still many species which could be removed from the global gene pool while maintaining conditions sustainable for human existence we have already removed so many already    by the same token we could also remove from existence every area and structure of any historical cultural and recreational significance farms and use the land and resources for the production of energy and consumer goods
its too late guys im an ex gov employee at the state level major food exporter there used to be an approach called integrated pest management now they just spray before during and after from planting to harvest destination china     the song birds are all crashing they feed their young exclusively with the caterpillars that get dose with the pesticides the entomologists know what is going on the rest of the planet doesnt care and certanly not average people
    when the j curve comes i sincerely hope you or your descendants are still alive to witness it
  youre either a great troll or an absolute moron
  this bacteria needs to start working on some new disease to attack asians
  africans
  africans dont pollute that much as chinese bois
  their wages and cost of living is rising making it ever more difficult for them to produce the cheap goods that made them rich in the first place  i thought their plan was always to cripple western infrastructure at the expense of their slave labor and then just strike when were down funny how thats turning out for them
  global warming fearmongers are like the 2012 retards you just need to get past them and understand the real problems
  the simple fact is that the world is a lot more complicated than it used to be there are constantly more and more issues to know about more technologies and impacts to follow leading to more complex politics with even the most distant nations somewhere along the way the complexity has outstripped normal peoples ability to really understand the world at least without years of directed effort  that seems to be the main problem along with the whole digital progress where many systems currently in place are being managed solely by computer algorithms nobody can really control any longer  spooky times
  asias population growth is currently decelerating
  decelerating growth is still growth  good thing too because without population growth there would be no economic growth and then how would you pay for all your stuff
   what do you call people who anally make it their hobby to maintain aesthetic landscapes    cunts
    there was never anything in the long term interest of america to outsource remember that on your way to the unemployment line
  look at the us  the us is virgin territory try looking at europe where humans have been living in modern civilization for thousands of years
  by the same token we could also remove from existence every area and structure of any historical cultural and recreational significance farms and use the land and resources for the production of energy and consumer goods  we interact with historical cultural and recreational structures a lot more than we do with toucans seahorses and orangutans in fact we already have biodiversity preservation facilities where we keep the species we demonstrably value the most zoos
    and your point being
  anything without immediate value to humans is worthless  this why were going to meet a slow agonizing death
    it has been the failure of scientists and environmentalists to recognize the need to take political control by any means necessary     instead they serve as lap dogs at worse as helpless bystanders or pathetic fringe groups at best
  that we should prioritize our shit over polar bears      value doesnt even make sense from a nonanthropocentric standpoint we are the only sapient species that we know of we define what is and isnt valuable and we must first exist in order for the concept to hold any meaning so yes things which dont provide value to humans are worthless     does this mean ignoring long term effects of our actions no but if we can still enjoy the things we value without a particular species existing then that species isnt particularly valuable is it
  you think youre smart but youre really not
  sounds communism to me are you an unholy impious degenerate communist anon
   conservative retard ignoring scientific evidence that doesnt fit their ideology   libtard science bad   screech autistically at the prospect of paying small amount extra to stop environmental damage   thinks modern agriculture solely keeps pollinators around out of loving benevolence towards bees   propose artificial solution that will make food cost 10x more than before   cant see the irony
  liberalism has been completely unable to control the birth rates of the populations that it inhabits  of course just as all those exploding populations in liberal nations like australia the uk france or germany would indicate
       that we should prioritize our shit over polar bears    thats what we have been doing for the past several hundred years    polar bears may not be essential to the global ecosystems many higher order animals arent particularly the predators the world would be impacted but would eventually manage to survive without the likes of wolves eagles and whales    the fact that cunts like you would carelessly wipe out entire species of such animals for the sake of your trivial comforts is a matter of ethical judgement however it is the welfare of the lower order organisms we are dealing with here the insects without a robust and diverse population of which catastrophic environment damage will occur but if by this event it will result in the extermination of every single one of your mind set then in the long run measured in millions of years it may be a price worth paying
  paying small amount extra to stop environmental damage    yeah man those carbon taxes will absolutely go towards the environment and not straight into richfags pockets
  china is also a disgusting authoritarian nightmare    vast majority of chinese are not harmed by the regime unless they actively oppose it china is like the ussr in this except that they also ditched the retardation that is communism and allow private companies thus bypassing the greatest blunder of the soviets
  the chinese are engaging in the genetic engineering of humans this is china so its going to turn out absolutely terrible for an uncomfortably long period of time but no one else is even trying    well said and the same thing is true for nuclear power china is one a a very few nations where nuclear is expanding fast
  theres a huge increase in xenophobic nationalism    implying this is a bad thing in the long term nation based on xenophobic nationalism will persist while nations based on openness will be overrun by climate migrants from africa
  born too late to explore earth  born too early to explore galaxy  born just in time to witness the end of humanity
  less whites more niggers  always been a staple liberal policy
  if pollinators go we will all die very soon after  china had tested succesfully microbee robots for this purpose
fuck insects
  without a robust and diverse population of which catastrophic environment damage will occur  thats why my question still stands what is the minimum biodiversity required to sustain our agriculture and economic practices assuming current technology not all insects are equally useful amazonian centipedes and moths are not as critical to us as bees or worms for instance at the very least we need organisms that enable us to farm food wood fish and livestock anything beyond what sustains us is ultimately expendable especially if the alternative means regressing the standard of living 100 years and crippling the global economy
    the you may as well ask any question to which there is yet no definite answer and is unlikely to be in the foreseeable future     i am sure it is possible to cite studies which give various estimates some more conservative than others the time frames of the estimates may be also be questionable given that the long term effect of species depopulation are uncertain    its an imperfect science which is the point you are trying to make one which can not by its very nature give precise answers and by which you hinge your justification to carry out further environmental destruction    but your justification is similar to down playing the danger of playing a form of russian roulette with only one bullet in the chamber rather than two we know that at some point the results are catastrophic we strongly suspect we are reaching that point due to the unprecedented decline of indicator species if we have not yet already passed it to risk this result for the transitory comfort it might give to a strikingly small percentage of the human population alive today is repugnant not only ethically but also casts doubt upon rationality of the collective human species    but you are looking for an excuse to maintain and in some cases increase the energy and material consumption which provides you with things like dental care holidays in exotic locations fashionable clothes and new electrical appliances every year anything that opposes that will be dismissed    should your mindset prevail  which it will unfortunately  i am sure you will continue to live in an age where such luxuries are still available i guarantee your descendants will not
  the people who can do something about it dont want to because its more profitable not to  how are we any different than bacteria following a chemical gradient toward food profit just replaces nutrients in our version of chemotaxis
  i guarantee your descendants will not  so better to give them up now in solidarity or something climate doomsayers are now claiming the apocalypse is coming and its already too late so what is the incentive to destroy our economies prematurely
  i love my fresh produce to have chewed holes and eggs all through it
  bacteria have no ability to choose to do something else they arent able to understand concepts like sustainability you cant look at what a bacterium is doing and assign a moral value to it free will arguments aside humans are rightfully held to a higher standard
  so what is the incentive to destroy our economies prematurely  prematurely  the economy is consumption there is no incentive just consume it all as fast as possible until its all gone
  have a choice between no more economy ever because everyone is dead or reduction in profits that you would never get any of  destroying everything is the best solution because fixing it is hard
  sure on the individual level or in small groups but it seems like our actions on large scales arent much different than a bacteriums
  its because the people at the top got there through greed and selfishness  why would they suddenly stop
why are the elite actively trying to grow populations  we can decrease our impact and have a better standard of life for more people by having less of us  why are they importing millions of fast breeding low iq immigrants into europe   to keep the ponzi scheme going and trash the planet
  the economy is consumption  and production all economies feature these things by definition      its not even a matter of salvaging its all over havent you seen the latest reporting on climate change
  from a scientific perspective production is consumption too
  academics at the london school of economics sold them and us a pretty lie theyve been doing it for decades
this article isnt even covering honeybee population loss just because of ccd which isnt linked to pesticide use btw noobs
    check out the new ghonorreah very promising god hates fags
    maybe by staying away from the jewish ponzi
  youre right it doesnt even look like were going to even limit climate to 45 celsius increase past preindustry the ball just wont stop rolling people arent even trying to control population its looking beyond grim it seems were enslaved to our desires that will be our downfall i dont know
  so if its all over which it isnt but lets pretend then what the fuck is the point of setting us back with regard to standard of living the market is very adept at finding solutions to problems even when neither could be predicted ahead of time the 1st world is the only place a solution if one can be found will be found it is more important than ever that market forces be allowed to work freely and efficiently without being burdened by clueless bureaucrats and massive taxes if were all going to die might as well stay in tip top shape for as long as possible in the hopes of finding a fix instead of gimping ourselves and slowly waiting for the end
  why did you post this on 100 different boards
  fuck the insects especially mosquitoes  something else will fill their niche
    simply because there still remains a chance to mitigate the damage the full extent of which is still uncertain and which ranges in estimation from a near total extinction event to lower ranges    think of it as being like taking a loaded gun away from your head and just randomly shooting it at some part of your body better chance of survival    but honestly i dont think thats going to happen mass media in the hands of the corporations means people are too easily manipulated by vested and selfish interests to the detriment of the global environment    congratulations you will have won whatever that means in a world which will undergo substantial ecological collapse
  you should read it as even in protected areas i havent seen anything but wasps in years and the occasional fly and bee butterflies are pretty much gone
jesus how dramatic
    first the free market created most of these problems in the first place second the free market has had over half a century to provide solutions it has failed to do so third there is no incentive for the free market to provide solutions which hinder its own profitability a profitability which has been artificially sustained by the exploitation of natural resources and the long lag time period of the planet reacting to damage    where i would agree with you however is in the existing forms of government and political hierarchy providing any sustainable solutions
how about we breed less niggery bugs who dont need to fuck up crops to do their stupid bug shit  and also kill all mosquitos
  france has recently banned a lot of pesticides and the eu has banned the worst of them so well see if insects return there in the next few years
cant we fix this problem by having more chinese people ride airplanes
somehow /pol/bros will link this to nonwhite people  see them do it now
  this is only bad news if you assume we want to maintain the human population at its current size i dont if global warming/fucking the planet up results in less people thats a cost im ready to pay provided i survive of course
  grow algae and use it as food engineer it to taste good  we need to grow the population
  majority of problems can be summed up as there being too many people  we need to grow the population
  people need to collectively recognize all life and living as sacred and unify religion to realize its true purpose explaining life and living and whats good of course we need major cultural and politicaleconomic change but that simply wont happen unless we all recognize the living god that gives us everything and lies at the heart of all our beliefsthere are many practical things to be done that we all need to be doing secular observation of biologyall though its a good thing as life is secular along religious lifedenial just wont cut it when the economy is draining the life out of the planet at breakneck speed
  i used to be antireligion now ive realized im just not a big fan of most existing ones god is the only thing more powerful than money
  with some of the otc weedkillers and pesticides you only really need a couple of idiots spraying that shit the most common domestic weedkillers stay in the ground for fucking ages before breaking down like 510 years    i think a big change has been the loss of gardening in a lot of the west it used to be that everyone had a garden that they sort of kept up with so you had a decent level of diversity and niches for little animals and things now people pave over it because they want another car parking space and also cant be bothered
  with some of the otc weedkillers and pesticides you only really need a couple of idiots spraying that shit  people are so incredibly dumb about poisons my neighbor was spraying whatever awful things she bought in shorts and flipflops with no mask of course on her cracks while her kids were playing right there thats pretty much the only time theyre outside and theres no way to get her to stop without it being banned and then her running out of it at least her kids wont have lice    she also just left big piles of rat poison all over because that was easier than cleaning up
  i have no problem with that i agree entirely its just that we are going to take down a lot of other species with us thats the part that pisses me off
as soon as it becomes profitable companies will compete for pollination contracts where artificially made or mass harvested pollen is sprayed over large areas    stop memeing
was put on risperdal for ocd and depression in early highschool apparently thats not a standard set of disorders its used to treat    did i get memed by the big pharma botnet how weird do you have to be to have tardive discardia
  did it work i was put on an array of different antidepressants and benzos that only exasperated my anxiety nowadays i self medicate with adderall ritalin and alcohol
  cbt is the correct treatment for depression and ocd drugs are just for managing symptoms
  i was able to focus better but depression was still bad  i self medicate with weed and alcohol not on risperdal anymore but still on prozac
  yes i recovered from ocd exclusively by means of cbt specifically exposureresponse stuff i took medications for years and saw zero improvement i have weird fatigue/anhedonia problems now and i think they were caused by the drugs they started around the time i started taking them and never went away
how do i get into ad astra    
  by not being a 35 year old balding boomer
  this sort of shit might work for highly motivated intelligent kids but it wont work for lazy and/or stupid kids    thing is highly motivated intelligent kids will do well in any environment its the retards who needs the structured approach of common core
  be rich and have lots of connections these schools arent made for the masses
fucking yanks can you please use different words for school and university    this is a school for kids you utter retards
  common core  there were heaps of problems with how we taught math even before common core but common core is fucked and its raising a generation of math illiterate morons it has nothing to do with being structured it has to do with common core actually being fucked    when i was in highschool long time ago now but i was marked down for using pid instead of pir2 to calculate circumference
ielts is an intelligence test isnt non native adult dont get a scores more of a limit discass
 as she was leaving she said he told her i want you to know that i want to hug you so bad right now but i know that if i do ill just want more     in his facebook post dr tyson described the handshake as one he uses in appreciation of people with whom ive developed new friendships he said that at work ms watson freely offered hugs which he typically rejected but that on a few occasions he clumsily declared if i hug you i might just want more    
yeah that sounds about right  black pop science man is pretty cool
  wait that is sexual misconduct
professor suggests to read wikipedia article on time dilation  as the result of nature of spacetime  source howstuffworks
  your professor is an idiot then because there are about a zillion great introductory books to sr
  professor suggests to read wikipedia article  how the students arent reporting him
  name 1 one
  im not that person but spacetime physics by taylor and wheeler is good
  wikipedia is good and open
/sci/ why is it that people with majors that require no critical thinking/problem solving and dont make a difference for the future of humanity are the ones being recognized and given insane amounts of money in scholarships for studying worthless majors to why tf does anyone need to pursue a masters after completing a ba in middle eastern and north african studies literally 70k in scholarships for studying 3rd world neanderthals     sauce 
  you see when papa corrupt jew bureaucrat and momma corrupt jew bureaucrat love each other very much a worthless brat is born in order for the worthless brat to be eligible for a cushy job in state department he needs a degree this is it
  it says right there  a rhodes scholar should show great promise of leadership in short we seek outstanding young men and women of intellect character leadership and commitment to service  ie not beta masturbators who somehow want to get paid for doing their insular autistic sudokus
  has it ever occured to you anon that these majors are being funded as a twofold measure    eg  1 to keep the public placated and idiots out of positions of true power    2 to keep the educated population occupied and spiteful so they cannot continue to concentrate on attaining true power
  intellect  ba in middle eastern and north african studies    choose one
  he thinks being aware of this can break the cycle  lmao no you will never be free of the brainlet menace rightfully so
  why do you think someone with intellect couldnt handle a ba
  its not about if they can or cant that ba is literally all memorization hardly any critical thinking or problem solving is required yet is given 70k mainly because of 40 gpa in an honors program
  mainly because of 40 gpa  but thats explicitly not how the rhodes scholarship works read about it
  also    ba is literally all memorization  this isnt true have you done any ba courses i assume you were too busy masturbating i tried one or two and barely passed while i can get top marks in stem courses because there is a type of thinking required synthesis etc that i wasnt used to
  i know its not however she wouldnt have received it if not for it      bachelor of arts isnt science oriented on top of it being eastern and north african studies it cant get any easier than that
  bachelor of arts isnt science oriented  what the fuck does that have anything to do with what were discussing what a weird nonsequitur comment
i feel this thread was made by an actual big bang theory character your head is so full of star wars and reddit that you actually believe doing science is the only activity that involves thinking lmao
  its easier is my point i know first hand i highly doubt you had any top marks in stem courses if you barely passed some ba courses
  eastern and north african studies    wow so much thinking studying under developed niggers
  i highly doubt  i know you do because you are a child or a shutin and you cant understand that being good at math and chug and plug doesnt make you automatically able to write a good explanation of the cause of the iraq war
  ba shit is not about the topic it doesnt matter if the topic is niggers or glorious nippon or pepe its about whether you can find the right evidence for some question about the world and synthesise it into a logical argument just instead of quantitative stuff and experiments its other arguments and ideas besides it doesnt matter if you can do well at that while being dumb because the whole point of the rhodes is its not about her marks in her course so for fucks sake stop whining and being jealous of a situation that isnt even real you fucking weeping crawling worm
  what the fuck does that have anything to do with what were discussing    i never said we dont need majors like that my problem is that people studying majors that involve doing stuff like such are getting ridiculous scholarships to learn how to do things as such which doesnt take much critical thinking and much less problem solving
  this thread is a fucking disaster its just me explaining to you over and over the same thing i seriously have to post it fucking again you dont know what the rhodes scholarships purpose is what people get from it what criteria theyre selected on and what outcomes it has you just think  me science me should get moneyyy science help society other things dontttt  fucking faggot go and look up the people who got the rhodes scholarship in the past what they then went and did and tell me it would have been money better spend giving it to some mediocre science nerd good scientists already get their own scholarships  seriously please go and read what i asked because otherwise this has all been pointless
  much of the money has gone to people that end up doing useless shit idiot waste of 70k       fucking faggot  what are you gonna cry     science help society other things dontttt  look up the people who got the rhodes scholarship in the past   meghana narayan  international swimming champion from india    wow what a big help to society youre right
  this
  sports    selection criteria  in his will rhodes specified that he did not want his scholarships to go to merely bookworms he wanted candidates assessed in regard to  his literary and scholastic attainments  his fondness of and success in manly outdoor sports such as cricket football and the like  his qualities of manhood truth courage devotion to duty sympathy for the protection of the weak kindliness unselfishness and fellowship  his exhibition during school days of moral force of character and of instincts to lead and to take an interest in his schoolmates for those latter attributes will be likely in afterlife to guide him to esteem the performance of public duty as his highest aim    take it up with cecil rhodes do you even know who cecil rhodes is
  im thinking of for example two of the best prime ministers of australia  you couldnt take these guys and replace them with some nerds  the rhodes is not for nerds theres plenty of scholarships for nerds
  they give out money for these degrees bc no one would pay for them otherwise
what is so illegitimate about studying mena are you such a brainlet that you cannot see how we might require people to do research about that region so that we can better deal with them are you literally that fucking stupid
  so you would appropriate the capital in rhodes trust that he set up you want to steal a persons money and redistribute it to what you deem a more appropriate allocation are you stalin
  needing 70k to learn how to manage niggers and sand niggers    are you really that fucking stupid that you genuine think it takes that much cash to teach someone how to deal with neanderthals
  this is the sticking point perhaps  because of your science funding mindset you think that the scholarship is to help the person learn their subject thats not what it does
  this tbq  journalism communications and business majors are the most cancerous worthless people in any college not that studying stem or whatever other shit makes one inherently better but these people attend universities almost explicitly to waste tution money party fuck and disrupt people who actually care about being in college
  regardless its a waste of 70k to people like        some dumbass that thinks giving 70k to an international swim competitor is a good idea
if op is so smart why doesnt he just invent some science and become rich so that he can fund himself 70000 is like two years at a mid level state school     if scientists are so smart why dont they have all the money
  70000 for two semesters     jesus is that for out of state students i go to an upper tier state university and pay nowhere near that amount as im from the state and city
  if you cant handle arts courses you are a fucking brainlet
  implying your autistic play sets will have even one iota of the impact that these people that will head governments and international orgs will have
  you absolute sniveling retard engineer  if your math classes were plug and chug problem solving no wonder you dont have the proper perspective  shut the fuck up engicuck
  well seeing as we are literally rendering human governments obsolete with artifical intelligence yes we have a far stronger impact
  seeing as we are literally rendering human governments obsolete with artifical intelligence  strong delusion my friend
  living in denial isnt going to stop anything
  ai aint ever happening boyo
  we dnt need it to be anything like humans  we just need it to manage society better than humans   it doesnt matter if its actually sentient or thinking all that matter is if it moves the data in the matrix around quickly efficiently   you are just a piece of data and can be manipulated as such
  a computer has no power nor ability to execute a given political decision unless we allow it to
most people accept that dogs despite having virtually all the same social traits that humans do are less intelligent than humans so then why dont we also accept that some members of our own species are almost as intellectually limited as dogs with the small exception that unlike dogs they happen to have the power of speech
  this is not a racist post by the way considering where i am posting this i just realized i should make that clear every race has doglevelintelligence members
  but some races have more dog intelligencers than others now you are a racist like the rest of us kid
  yyou think they were good you wot m8
  why do you guys always talk in this weird imperious tone when you went to school with countless human shit stain rich kids and frat boys who will get 6 and 7 figure jobs through their parents and contribute nothing to the economy do you actually think there are more jewish legacy faggots working at vox and the state dept than 105 iq alcoholic coke head sociopaths working at elite law firms as financial managers and in the oil industry or doing defense contracts while fucking 12 year old hookers on business trips in se asia i dont get why unless its displaced ressentiment that you people feign this kind of all knowing exhaustion with the jew as if your own race isnt decadent and pathetic in its own right
  bob hawke and based tony   wasnt counting cuckbull
last christmas i give the cock  i give you the cock
will you miss 4chan when its gone
  nothing of value will be lost
  no nostalgia
  but ive already been here for years left felt nostalgia come back that point is past anon
  look at the address bar
  it has begun
  no since everyone from containment boards will just flood and shitpost in 4channel
  based 4channel supremist
  no this website has very likely singlehandedly destroyed my life
  its been gone for years
  maybe youre right but i think its bigger than that the whole internet has changed everything has changed and for the worse
i think 4chan will probably outlive me to be honest
  this who else /suicide/ here
  ill just migrate to an even gayer website
im happy about it for one the further /sci/ is from /pol/ the better once the polshills dont see links to /sci/ any more theyll forget about us and slowly but surely youll start seeing way fewer climate change is a hoax and race realism and nasa is cgi earth is flat and then we can finally raise the quality of the posts here
  yes we will finally be able to have nothing but collegerelated threads without having /pol/tards distracting us
  ive seen a lot of fairly convincing evidence that a lot of nasa is cgi their own footage
  im cgi since i was 5yo nasa doesnt even come close its all props and smoke
whats 4chan is that some kind of reddit shit   i only browse 4channel
  i already do op
    i love this board serial experiments lane for the win
who else thought theyd be lain
why did something happen again  as long as /sci/ and /a/ are fine ill be fine there are some /a/ replacements in case it goes down nothing for /sci/ though unfortunately
fixed
nice
  fixed

how are your stem studies going
  get yourself together    i like your paper and i think you have the right idea getting it all written down and out     but realizing a problem and writing down a problem do not address the problem    make a second page  for every worry and complaint you have write a preposed solution     best of luck
  nigga i just started my masters and im 26 youve got plenty of time to get your shit together
  hahah im 31 you stupid fucking nigger
  i relate far too much to this to the point where i could have written most of it
  tfw last quarter  only need to get at least 200 in my classes to pass  prof wont talk about the curve  expected the averages on tests to be 80 to 85 instead they were 45  still above average but dont know if he will still just fail almost everyone for not hitting his goal of having people score above 80 in the class     i hate this shit so much bugs me that the hw is piss easy but then come test time the material is way different
  damn that sucks im 21 and i already have a masters in math
im doing my first year in maths taking real analysis and linear algebra pretty good i think
im in a worse position  kek
do what you enjoy they said  i dont even enjoy being alive  float the idea of dropping out to advisor in a secretly cynical way maybe fishing for hope  actually encourages it
  float the idea of dropping out to advisor in a secretly cynical way maybe fishing for hope  actually encourages it  is that real
  fatality
  lmao youre a fucking idiot
    shit man i dont know what to tell you talk to your advisers befriend someone anyone start living healthier stop comparing yourself to other people if its not motivating you to improve yourself
i have one more semester with only one class to take plus my senior design project
  tfw incapable of focusing on anything  tfw can never pay attention in class  tfw have zero motivation and nonstop avolition  tfw disorganized thinking  tfw gpa is absolute dogshit
  thats pretty much been my semester as well but with 2 courses like that class average is around a 50 in one but due to the professors curve calculation im passing somehow the professor of the other class hasnt posted any info about the curve so i dont know whether or not im gonna get justed hes a total bro though so i might squeal by thank god next semester is going to be much easier
  kekd
  squeak by     im on mobile
mostly done with ms 37gpa gonna add a second major things are going ok
  are you me
  40 gpa currently but likely will fall to 39 as im hovering around a 90 for math  hopefully theres a curve that will bring me up  good luck op youre still young so you still have time to get your shit together but the sooner the better hoping for the best for all in here
  6 years on undergrad  thats nothing man i had two friends who spent 7 and 8 years on their undergrad respectively one could not be assed to pass anything after most of his cc credit did not transfer the other had motivation issues and watched two programs shutdown within a year of his enrollment   the first one is currently working as a paid janitor with 8 years of student loans left to payoff he ended up with a ba in environmental sciences if i remember correctly the other just got his masters in physics last year
  i had to take a few weeks off and interrupt my masters because stress caught up with me after 2 straight yrs of doing uni shit
  i cant believe hes dead bros
  im on mobile hehe xd  please go     environmental science  he deserved what he got
math major doing a minor in econ in 4th year will probably be back for a semester in 5th do finish up residual courses 32 gpa but hopefully will have a 40 for this semester after exams working on a final project for econometrics that is fulfilling and should get a chance to more research related to it later all in all pretty ok desu
  nigga i havent even finished my bachelors and i just turned 28 best case scenario and i wont even have my ms until im 31
stop fucking posting this macon
  tfw 21  tfw just started with ece bachelors
  be foreigner in 1st year   1st term is mostly things ive already done in high school back at home still study every waking moment ace the term   2nd term my mind fries up i stop leaving my home except for groceries constantly tired do no assignments and barely pass   advisoror whatever you call it in undergrad changes after that year  meet him a couple of years later  its okay anon not being from here means you had a lot of catching up to do
questions that dont deserve their own thread  why are aldehydes more reactive than ketones can someone explain the mechanism to me
its because they are less sterically hindered also the extra carbon in ketone acts as an edg through the inductive effect to make the carbonyl carbon less reactive    q  can someone confirm if i got the mechanism right in the oxidation of piiipv using h2o/i2  this is part of the solid phase synthesis of dna/rna if it makes a difference
  forgot pic
asked in /sqt/ but didnt get anything what would be a solid undergrad text for special and general relativity
  hartle is the one that should be good for introduction to the topic if you want to learn more schutz/wald should suffice
  thanks mate
lmao so relateble have an upvote
  upboated
  gee op i know im a brainlet but you didnt have to make it so painfully obvious
  mods
  faggot  the act of being op
  epic im going to post this to my facebook
summary of what i learned in biochem
god damn and i really respected this guy too    two more women accuse neil degrasse tyson of sexual misconduct    two more women including a fellow astronomer say neil degrasse tyson is guilty of inappropriate sexual conduct    dr katelyn n allers associate professor of physics and astronomy at bucknell university told me that she was felt up by tyson at an afterparty following a meeting of the american astronomical society aas in 2009 aas didnt have a mechanism for reporting sexual harassment at the time but dr allers says she probably would report the incident if it had happened today     
  why are you giving so much authority to these cunts why do you keep spamming this board with this
  op dedicates their life to subversion
the dude did nothing wrong other than one arguably creepy comment he should sue these women
hes obnoxious enough to check under a womans dress to see if she tattooed pluto i believe his denial
not science or math
literally no evidence  i dont like black science man but roasties jumping on the rape bandwagon doesnt mean anything
  tenalp a si otulp
patheos  patheoscom is the premier online destination to engage in the global dialogue about religion and spirituality and to explore and experience the worlds beliefs patheos is the website of choice for the millions of people looking for credible and balanced information about religion
  two more accusations both of which have no astronomical significance
prove it happened you cant into the toilet hilarious when you apply the scientific method to womans bs
  lol i believe baseless accusations because they confirm my racist bias
  /pol/ is almost exclusively a racist at all costs board they dont care about anything else
  in any other country he could sue for libel and win and he could also sue the newspapers for defaming him and win
  were you in a coma and missed all the accusations against whtoids recently
  see 
  why cant he in this country
  no its not
    god damn and i really respected this guy too    lol what are you talking about he gets more pussy than most physicists hes based af
  i respect him more now
  eurasians  why are you faggots saying this now your ancestors have lived in europe for 34000 years and are from western eurasia for even longer than that you think steppe niggers are polite or at all respectful towards women
  god damn i really respected this guy too  uses reddit spacing  what a shocker
  im indifferent towards bsm    but im glad this cunt got banished from the spotlight
  who cares its hilarious when some supplicating faggot gets metood
i love watching liberals cannibalize themselves whos next  bill nye  adam savage
  no its not
adolf hitler was a migrant
  sounds like the liberals are the ones who stay true to their convictions rather than making egregious concessions just because youre on the same team
  adam savage  doubt it if that happens then vsauce is next
  accusations  innocent until proven guilty
  its absolutely nothing about staying true to your convictions its about women seeing an opportunity to get attention and taking it the people who pretend to be outraged over this are also doing it for selfish reasons its an easy way to score brownie points in the eyes of their peers nobody involved in this gives a flying fuck about integrity or consistency theyre all in it for self serving reasons just like everybody ever no matter which side youre on
  their moral system is based on morals they dont actually believe in  stupid nonsense
  hes obnoxious enough to check under a womans dress to see if she tattooed pluto  i would too
  morals are inherently selfserving nobody would willingly dedicate time and effort into the upkeep of a system if they didnt believe they got something out of it someday
  vsauce is a closet home men cant be part of metoo
  whatever happens neil the grass tyson is still an incredibly smug cockwomble nothing but schadenfreude
  as someone who lives in portland one of the liberal capitals of the country they have an odd habit of letting shit slide if it involves someone on the same team
  shame on you for respecting a popsci do nothing timebomb
  what if they believe it is ultimately selfserving to maintain such a system
  then their morals are in conflict with the system in place and theyll most likely wish to remove it and replace it with system that is to their liking but every bit as selfserving as the one before it
  then their morals are in conflict with the system in place  what
  you seem confused selfishness actually encourages the consistent application of a moral code if you believe the purpose of that code is to serve you
  having a modicum of respect for more stars in the universe than atoms in the universe tv man      its /pol/s fault meme science man sexually assaulted women    this board is pathetic
  so suddenly because hes black he actually did it  you guys deny it when kavanauh assaults someone but not when the guy is black
  of course i believe he has a right to a fair trial you troglodyte and if he is proven innocent then that is all well and good however the fact that watson actually reported the misconduct gives much more credibility to her claims than christine i remember literally nothing about the incident but it totally happened you guys ford i shouldnt have worded my previous post like its a fact that he did but whatever its a greentext so who cares    this has literally nothing to do with his race if bill nye was credibly accused of sexual assault i would be saying the same exact thing you are the one who is making a sexual assault investigation racially charged and you should be ashamed
  two more women accuse neil degrasse tyson of sexual misconduct    this is my opinion on the matter  not only regarding tyson    take it to court the same day it happened or the day after or shut the fuck up with your imaginary problems
  tyson literally admits two of the incidents happened in his facebook post  wow why arent you denying it you hypocrites
  tyson literally admits two of the incidents happened in his facebook post    i dont give a fuck    if he did something criminal they would lock him up is he in jail
  youre the one whos confused here people generally dont believe that being selfish is particularly moral most groups often try to paint a picture of their ooposition as being selfish and uncaring while portraying themselves as the opposite people will always prefer to rationalize their selfishness as something more noble whether or not that selfishness produces results or not also take your pics back to /pol/ this is /sci/
  because of heisenbergs uncertainty principle its impossible for my goalposts to be stationary ndtfag
    gives much more creditability to her claims  watson said tyson occasionally made misogynistic comments and that he kept a list of overweight actresses on his phone to prove that women arent inhibited by portrayals in the media when it comes to health and fitness he allegedly said it was untrue that women feel pressured to be skinny based on societal standards    exactly what credible misconduct is present here unless i missed something its not like they were naked or pornographic pictures that he showed her it may come off as creepy or poor taste but just like the galaxy tattoo and handshake nothing fully inappropriate occurred to warrant sexual misconduct or assualt    i feel like everyone is dancing around the fact that the large majority of scientists have no game in terms of talking to women just because tyson has a wife/kid and seems confident in talking science/education material doesnt mean it fully translates into other sectors and honestly talking about certain topics with the average woman will always trigger a creep response try talking to a woman about nondualism for an halfhour and bring up how everyone experiences rape in their past/current lives depending on the philosophic interpretation utilized here and everyone is evil including the victims of evil and see how well the woman responds to such a lecture protip it wont go well
  hes not in his right mind a scientist is not a regular movie star hes more important than people who dont contribute to the human race  he must be trying to look the bigger person
  protip    real protip here dont talk to women ever nothing good will come of it
  how did you leak out of incelsme anyway      agreed this is pol shit it does not belong here
  and if he is proven innocent  what there has to be proof that hes guilty otherwise there is a presumption of innocence just so you remember
  people generally dont believe that being selfish is particularly moral  but selfishness itself has little to do with morality nobody says for example that its immoral to keep your own heart even though you could kill yourself and selflessly donate it to someone in need  and if you know this isnt /pol/ why are you projecting autistic reductionist fallacies  infant cannibalism is fine trust me i know for a fact most people dont actually think its wrong theyre just virtue signaling or afraid of being caught while demonizing the other side
  america has a higher than average bar for convicting for libel or slander
i am asked by thousands of people per year to take pictures with them a flattering time consuming but delightful chore as many in my fanbase can attest i get almost giddy if i notice youre wearing cosmic bling  clothing or jewelry or tattoos that portray the universe either scientifically or artistically and i make it a priority to point out these adornments for the photograph  a colleague at a well attended afterconference social gathering came up to me to ask for a photograph she was wearing short pants with a tattooed solar system extending up the posterior of her upper thigh and while i dont explicitly remember searching for uranus it is surely something i might have done in that situation i was reported to have groped her by searching up her pants while i said and heres uranus when this was simply a search on the covered part of her pants i only just learned nine years after that she thought this behavior creepy
  legibility  reddit spacing
  but selfishness itself has little to do with morality  thats not what youve been saying here  nobody says for example that its immoral to keep your own heart even though you could kill yourself and selflessly donate it to someone in need  they dont because suicide is considered selfish and thus immoral  and if you know this isnt /pol/ why are you projecting autistic reductionist fallacies  if you know this isnt /pol/ why are you arguing using autistic strawmen like  infant cannibalism is fine trust me i know for a fact most people dont actually think its wrong theyre just virtue signaling or afraid of being caught while demonizing the other side
guys on the right   sexual offenders or promoters of it  ugly  arrogant  have stupid opinions    guys on the left  healthy sexual lives beautiful wifes  handsome  humble they dont go around spouting nonsense about other fields
  healthy sexual lives beautiful wives  anon i like einstein as much as the next guy but
  dont go around spouting nonsense about other fields  probably cause they were scientists not philosophers of science
    muh sexual assault  credibly accused  please fucking kys white knight
  but tyson is neither
    all of you get in the can
  thats not what youve been saying here  but it is  they dont because suicide is considered selfish and thus immoral  flimsy reasoning suicide can be selfless consider the soldier who leaps on a grenade to save his buddies now what  if you know this isnt /pol/ why are you arguing using autistic strawmen  its not a strawman its your argument distilled erroneously assume everyone is pretending and then lean on that assumption to dismiss their convictions
  he kept a list of overweight actresses on his phone to prove that women arent inhibited by portrayals in the media when it comes to health and fitness he allegedly said it was untrue that women feel pressured to be skinny based on societal standards    based
  but it is  you claim that  but selfishness itself has little to do with morality  while you yourself argued before that  selfishness actually encourages the consistent application of a moral code  if selfishness has so little to do with morality why argue about it in the first place  flimsy reasoning suicide can be selfless consider the soldier who leaps on a grenade to save his buddies now what  missing the point the selfishness of suicide is debatable but the reality is that most people still consider it a selfish act in general whether you agree with that or not i personally agree with you but that doesnt matter when discussing perceptions and views of people in general  its not a strawman its your argument distilled erroneously assume everyone is pretending and then lean on that assumption to dismiss their convictions  your strawman makes it seem as if i considered sexual harrasment acceptable while i never expressed such an opinion
  what fucking trail none of these people are being sued there are no official cases filed against them and so they can never be proven innocent its the exact same tactic crazy leftists have used ever since mattress girl she has still had zero repercussions and the whole saga is still detrimental to actual rape victims just launch a media crusade and no one can defend themselves    the lesson here is to do what wallstreet men are doing just stay away from lefty women entirely in a best case scenario they just use men to advance their own careers failing that they throw tantrums in the media dont talk to them outside of work and avoid them at work as much as possible stick to the rational boys and girls go home and fuck your wife
  just stay away from lefty women  its true they will just take one comment out of context and use it to hurt you if they feel they can gain some kind of power
  even if they come to you and ask you for help and you actually help them they will then file complaints against you for mansplaining those women are outright crazy and desperate for any sort of attention/nonmerital promotion    when a lefty women asks me for something i make excuses to be elsewhere the only women i actually help/promote and interact with at work are those who are not politcal and have bfs/husbands/normal hobbies and i have talked about my girlfriend/hobbies before watch out for the beta orbiting incels too luckily most people are normal and they will support you if you are friendly with them
why is no mainstream news outlet like cnn reporting on crispr babies this is definitely one of the most significant scientific breakthroughs of the century do they still not believe him
  more hiv resistant  no way of testing it  gib monies plz    snake oil babies are snake oil
      literally on the front page of cnn for the last few days you fucking mongoloid
  cnn  mainstream  fun fact fox news has like 4 times the viewership of cnn  cnn is actually somewhat niche its like 10th place in tv networks
  go back to the russian internet gay
  sstop breaking my immersion  
  significant scientific breakthroughs of the century    but he hasnt demonstrated anything in fact hes caught himself in a greater ethical dilemma and what all the fuss is about because he precisely has no way of testing his experiment babies in any circumstance nor is the long term consequences of his mutations known eg has it affected anything else the lack of uniformity observed in cells taken and tested have also presented issues which were already understood and known about by the scientific community working in that area and one of the major reasons why noone takes it so lightly and frivolously as this guy has done his trampling on the the standard ethical processes and conduct in evening performing this work could backfire on the research area as a whole    this guy was a shortsighted moron and nothing to look up to nor praise
who else is fucking pumped for fall term finals i feel like i could murder dwaynetherockjohnson in fair unarmed combat eat one half of his bloody corpse raw and dryfuck the other half into an unrecognizeable pile of gore and i dont even care which half is which fuck i am goddamn horny for this boys

what is /sci/ thoughts about optimistic nihilism    i started having an optimistic nihilistic view of things a few years ago only to find out recently how this way of thinking is called and honestly i fucking love it  started dealing with family members death and funerals way better stopped worrying so much about things i will forget in a few weeks months or even years stopped worrying about what other people think and their shitty lifes anon why are you asking us what we think about this then i am just wondering and im genuinely curious thats all stopped having so many self doubts kinda embrassed death as a part of life and that it just happens and most importantly the realisation that nothing really matters and thats why life shouldnt be taken so seriously the point of it is just enjoying it as much as possible before the lights go out try to spread your genes and try to learn as much as possible about your surroudings through science because whats the point of being alive if you dont know wtf is around you and how it works we should take solace with the fact that nothing really matters because the heat death of the universe will make all this shit like it never happened to begin with but that doesnt mean you should stop trying to live a good life while you are here     so  is there any downsides to optimistic nihilism i would like to hear your opinions

there is no upsides to studying this sort of philosophy if you want to be a natural scientist it can only confuse the shit out of you and demotivate you better to listen to some upbeat music and shake your head a little bit
  im not studying it i just adopted it im studying science and im fine with this i listen to jake chudnow so upbeat musics are not for me ahah
  as well as many posts in this board you dont see me bitching about it
its the best way to live treat life seriously and not seriously balance yin yang middleway whatever the pros call it

and not newton and leibniz    this is what gauss said    in a certain respect one can rather say of leibniz that he spoiled mathematics his invention of differential calculus is not anything so great it was actually already prepared by archimedes    is this true
  he got it from india
  robin williams is alive
  he got it from india    ahh yes the kerala school that was founded in the 14th century     1700 years after archimedes death    makes logical sense
  dont even bother hes a pájeet
  archimedes invented calculus  plot twist it was eudoxus    he also came up with the first astronomical theory and he is likely the one who came up with the abstract theory of proportion used in the 5th book of euclids elements which is basically a precursor of dedekinds construction of the real numbers    eudoxus is the unsung hero of mathematics most likely he was too smart for his times

what is better technological augmentation or genetic/biological editing sure why not both but here im asking a comparison  after due ponderation i think it is the second technological augmentation has several flaws we dont know how and if we can build synthetic tissues we should first find a way to give them power without having to recharge every few hours or so and every few years we should get surgery because prosthetics have the bad habit of not repairing themselves  what do you think /sci/ we will be ubermensch or cyborgs
  i think youre a popsci brainlet and should fuck off back to /tg/ or wherever you come from
  popsci brainlet  frogposter  im in a thread i dont like why am i mad  found the literal brainlet now answer the question or get out faggot
  dont make another post on my board ever again    get owned kiddo
  getting outclassed by a frogposter on /sci/  fucking embarassing but rest easy knowing that youre not alone in this sea of retards
  technological augmentation or genetic/biological editing  technological augmentation all the way at least in the end of day youre still a human  
probably biological its always easier to improve upon already working things instead of replacing that shit completely
  genetic/biological  this

hey /sci/    ive completely stagnated in my life its a long story of how i got here full of abuse and neglect and also my own inability or lack of motivation to change but lets get to the point    i am extremely behind academically i have trouble doing fractions and i can barely do 4th hyear high school physics i ahve been diagnosed with add and have no study skills whatsoever     i a verymuch interested in physics i always have been since i was little but i have never dealt with the actual math i have never tried breaking through the pop sci   i realised this about a year ago and completely gave up on it i moved on and was planning to go study social work     but even after a year or two of doing nothing even remotely connected with science i cant shake the feeling that if i dont atually try and be proficient in math and physics i wont be able to look at myself in the mirror     so im trying to work on my math and physics through khan academy but i run into a lot of trouble and together with my add its hard    i live with my parents and work in a store fulltimei am in 6000 euro debt wich im paying off and i have a low level high school diplomadutch i kind of okay social skills and very little experience in life     how do i go about improving myself  ive been lurking a lot on /sci/ and i admire you guys     some advice would be awesome
op here    im 23 years old
adult with add    what
  its a thing  look it up
  add   so why arent you on adderall or whatever fun drugs you kids get for free nowadays    i am in 6000 euro debt  bruh thats nothing
    i am on ritalin and it doesnt really work all that well i know thats nothing but i have to pay like 400 euros a months to debtors for about 16 moths so that sucks
    adderall is illegal in my countrynetherlands
  yeah i get that it sucks but my student loans are much higher than whatever you have and a great many people have a mortgage to pay off too so cheer up its not all bad    i have a low level high school diplomadutch  so vmbo which sub level how about going mbo  hbo  uni
    yeah vmbo    yeah i could do but it takes a shiotload of time and im already 23 also the worry is more that i dont have any life experience and dont know who i am what i like etc
  nigga just focus
  but it takes a shiotload of time and im already 23  if you want to get really good at physics it might take a lifetime 23 isnt that bad though if youre really dedicated its a viable path as any    lets say you do mbo and then get your hbo propedeuse takes 5 years but then vmbo was only like 3 or 4 years so part of that is making up for the 2 to 3 years you skipped compared to vwo i dont know you personal history so exact number i dont know in your specific case     then when you have hbop you can look around and think what you wanna do you can continue with hbo 3 years or switch to uni for a bsc 3 years uni will be harder hbo considerably easier but if you wanna do a msc after full hbo you almost always need a switching program to make up for lack of knowledge 6 months but at least you have a valid hbo diploma    msc is 1 year on non tu unis but 2 years on tus technische universiteit ie delft eindhoven or twente
    thank you    got any advice for brushing up my skills before doing it    also still trying to find out if i should stufy physics what kind ofperson should you be  why do poeple love physics
  sentences are not paragraphs retard
    does that mean that i am a retard though  ive just been poorly educated im like a huge fat guy thats in the gym his first day give me a break please
        fellow dutch fag doing a theoretical physics phd after a slightly non traditional route to drop some major bummer   ability to do physics is respected for those for which it comes easy getting a physics degree is really a benchmark for ability to do certain work afterwards if you have ever truely struggled with fractions as an adult physics is not for you combine this with add that prevents the true struggle needed for the less biologically gifted 8 hour study sessions every other day min and i can not truthfully recommend you getting a physics degree this pains me as i respect your drive and interest in physics as gaining an understanding of the natural world around is one of the most fulfilling things a man can do     luckily getting an academic wo diploma is not the only way this aim can be met i would definitely follow anons recommendation and do an hbo or mbo degree also consider that we are living in the information age and all scientific knowledge is for free on library genesis and scihub     i would recommend picking up strogatz nonlinear dynamics if you manage to work through that wo is worth it if not then not  also all stem research masters are two years
    thank you for the honesty man  but are there not still any othercareers i could pursue outside research anything that is also fulfilling im grasping at straws here  is there a way i can test myself to learn all of high school vwo physics in a year and if i do it i am suitable i mean it sounds unlikely that its impossible for me to study 8 hours a day     i just dont want to give up without putting myself through a real test i wont ever be able to genuinly enjoy my work   how could i prove it to myself
it all comes down to this    how bad do you want it
    i cant be happy doing anything else without having really tried and failed
  got any advice for brushing up my skills before doing it  kahn academy is a good start try to buy/borrow copies of the books you used during high school and also consider buying a few examen bundels take a look at the most recent final exams for your vmbo looking at them gives you better understanding of what is expected of you when you start mbo then do the exams when you think youre ready make sure to force yourself to adhere to the same restrictions as the official exam so no books/phone/whatever and allow yourself only the allotted time if you pass you know youre ready for the next step    for planning your studies set weekly goals but be realistic do not write down your end goal as a peak of a mountain you will surely lose motivation rather split it up like this week chapter 31 or whatever and keep track of your success and failures and provide feedback on yourself on what went well and why and what went badly and why and write down what you will do better to improve on this not only will this give you a much better overall feeling of accomplishment in the long run you will maintain much of your motivation and have a good way to keep going    also still trying to find out if i should stufy physics what kind ofperson should you be  why do poeple love physics  people do physics because they love the subject getting a physics degree for many is about more than just getting the paper they will love the subject for the rest of their life even if they end up doing something else completely career wise it is not for the faint of heart as  said and it will be a hard road but the achievement is overall well respected
  just kys desu
    thank you so much anon  my life is in the shitter right now  i ahve cold turkey stopped all my bad habits a week ago i will have to build upmy studying skillsto more and more time each day  im also ngoing to go back to therapy for my addmaybe try other meds    i wont be happy if i dont try  i have to do it
  there are an enough options for people interested in the natural world outside of pure physics i would think the best option with your background and add are applied science studies with some practical work probably hbo         stuff like biotechnologie chemie chemische technology bio informatica toegepaste wiskunde  technische natuurkunde en werktuigbouwkunde learns you scientific truths it does so in a very select area but this allows you actually use that knowledge a pleasure that must not be underestimated     also the advice of the other anons is correct 6000 euro and 23 is nothing do not let this keep you back from moving forward as otherwise youll be saying at 30 that you could have turned your life around at 23     godspeed
    thank you so much  i will make it to the other side  and if i dont i will at least be at peace   i wont ever be able to lok at myself ever again if i have not done the absolute maximum i could to be part of the things that i admire
this thread is cringe as fuck
  coke has similar effects to adderal
    nah i dont want to gte addicted to doing coke and fuck up my life irreversebly        i know i am a cringe machine like no other  any advice on not to be so cringe is also welcome
  23 is fine id say 30 is when its starting to get late

have you ever edited a wikipedia article just to include your own research paper or even created a new article to highlight your area of research
no and never will
  no because i havent researched anyhing
no but my advisor obviously did
  he probably had some unpaid student do it for him no
  knowing him he wouldnt have trusted someone else to do it right
  no but i used to constantly edit giorgio tsoukalos page to include his doctorate in science
  no i dont have my own research paper because im an undergrad in lab hell  work under a grad student and do pcr and rna purification over and over again for up to 10 hours at a stretch  grad student is supervised by a postdoc  grad student has talked to the pi only a few times only postdocs are worthy of conversing regularly with the pi  met pi once outside of the interview to get the assistant position and he seems like a real egotistical faggot shithead  my name better be on something by the end of this they only hired me because an undergrad and a normal thermocycler to do cycle course pcr is cheaper than one that does qpcr
  not yet but catch me editing that sweet artic fishes page soon boys
using wikipedia instead of infogalactic  do you like having some autist approved editor coming back to cuck you seconds after you made an addition
  sounds like an awful pi find another
not faking an edit war over if your paper should be included or not
wikipedia has been corrupted to the point of memehood when the fraud that is modern physics has been proven wrong by advanced ai the world will finally see that wangdongs proof of netwons laws of seminical refractules was right all along
hello /sci/    i know personal questions arent meant to be put here however i was thinking maybe someone could have some insight     i am currently in uk college and have been accepted into a top university in the usa     my issue is that i go through periods of extreme productivity followed by periods of extreme depression and nihilism at gcse and a level this isnt an issue however when i go to university i presume i will fall behind when i inevitably go through a period of nihilism i have tried to brute force it through the stage of depression however this just leads to the depression hitting even harder     any help is appreciated   anon
i know personal questions arent meant to be put here  stopped reading there reported
  ok do you want me to be angry or something what was the point in saying that
be me  be a physicsfag  first year is easy  autismhitsjpg  get the bright idea to deliberately tank everything  and i mean everything  figure that if i dig myself into a hole ill rise stronger  decide to do it  oneyearlaterpng  have totally stagnated  spent a whole year watching shows  dropped all social interactions  went to class only for the mandatory labs once a week  brain has rotten  10 classes behind  2 months until finals season  aam i autistic any other anons who tried a similar experiment it seemed like a good idea at the time
  lol why the fuck did you think it was a good idea
  i figured itd prepare me somewhat for life give myself an easy hurdle to overcome
  give myself an easy hurdle    isnt the point of a hurdle to make things harder for yourself as a challenge
  gotta stop any kind of my personal growth while watching shows for a year so i will rise stronger  the only way you may become somewhat stronger after that is if you catch up
  my thinking was that it was going to be tough but it was taking place in a sort of controlled environment it wasnt real life yet so i could experiment the plan was to learn to work under extreme pressure and come out a stronger more focused person
  thats the actual plan study and manage to pass the new classes plus some older ones and graduate at the same time as i was supposed to if i didnt fail classes
  hoo boy undergrad is supposed to be easy enough that undergrads can do it if you feel you arent being challenged pursue extracurriculars such as research youre probably going to find upper division classes to be more difficult i dont think youre necessarily autistic you just made a bad decision
  you double nigger youre giving yourself challenge by only doing the undergrad curriculum the nonbrainlet actual physicisttobe way is to in parallel take grad classes and alredy focus on your chosen specialization and start working on research with professors doing this work in your area     you fucked up and now not only will you not be able to catch up but youre alredy behind those who are not retarded like you and understood that what makes university hard is actually profiling yourself into some career    gg
    notamerican i cant select classes bar a direction during the final two semesters here you get into one division of the uni after hs and the curriculum is all decided by the uni
  im from central eu and no good universities do this in that case you go to a brainlet university and thats a gg by itself
  im a south europoor so im thinking of doing my phd at delft though i reckon i can raise these numbers
    this was a stupid move you should have focused on taking harder classes earlier not fucking yourself over why did you want to induce artificial hardship on easy material when you could have just taken harder material youll now feel a sense of accomplishment over what people consider the most basic classes in university    no guys im not dumb i was only pretending    no based on your reasoning you are legitimately stupid
  well like i said i cant take drop or whatever else any classes its all decided by the higher ups
  i somehow doubt that youre literally not allowed to take upper div courses even after consulting with the professors or the dean of the faculty thats just bullshit every respectful university needs to have means to promote curiosity in good students like this
  not really like i said the curriculum is set think of our unis as just schools on a harder difficulty you get to choose nothing bar a direction electronics theoretical etc at the last year thats the way all operate they are government run which means that theyre free and that you can never be kicked out
  in other words you attend some sort of polytechnic university that doesnt engage in research or have the right to grant doctorates
  what country do you study in
  nope not a polytechnic thats just code for engineering here    denbtland
  my fellow monkeynigger how doest thou
  you only get worse over time the older you get the more work you have to put in to stay sharp if you arent growing youre dying
  ah okay i guess i wish i wasnt a khv with no friends this whole business cost me more than just grades    yeah it makes sense i get that dunno at the time i felt as if i was conducting some psychological experiment in truth i guess i just wanted to see if i had enough mettle willpower whatever to pull it off
this is the most dunning krueger thing ive ever read
  post transcript pics or it never happened
this is what you asked for buddy    fight or perish
the crash is a top 5 mad men episode
predictive linear systems in one field is the same as chaotic nonlinear systems in another field
  thats not his point and you know it
  predict future events that we cannot actually test in any way vs almost everything can be tested
  we were right about this one thing therefore were always right
so next time a space ship blows or malfunctions can i use it as proof that global warming is fake
  stop paying attention to this dumb nigger
  space shuttles have already blown up in the past even though some didnt it must mean that global warming is both true and false at the same time
  also not his point
  what the fuck is it then
  these people spend years to gain expertise in their fields so chances are they know more than you  bbut the models are always changing and so are the predictions
  then hes making his point in a horrendously phrased way  either way dumb nigger
  na youre just a brainlet who cant think past the surface
  science nigga is deep
  he thinks that is deep  there really is no hope for humanity
women are lying whores    whoa neil
  they are
  the people who land shit on other planets are not the same ones working on climate models the success of one group of people does not imply the success of a different group studying a very different topic which also happens to be significantly more complicated      scientists have conducted studies that demonstrate that eye witness testimony is unreliable
  appeal to authority
do you believe in evolution  why
  archaeopteryx
a scientific theory is a wellsubstantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world based on a body of facts that have been repeatedly confirmed through observation and experiment such factsupported theories are not guesses but reliable accounts of the real world the theory of biological evolution is more than just a theory it is as factual an explanation of the universe as the atomic theory of matter or the germ theory of disease
  do you believe that a populations genetics can change over time
  yes because its pretty fucking obvious that all life shares a common ancestor
    no its not a religious system
  believe
  no i believe in metamorphism of species by prayer to greek gods
  weve literally seen natural selection the idea that it didnt start happening until we could write about it is fucking stupid
how to spot brainlets the question    that is perhaps the most stupid question in all of science its akin to asking do you believe in atoms
  not really
  though it would be fascinating if abiogenesis actually happened multiple times perhaps some life began on earth while other life arrived on comets or something    but this all happened billions of years ago and today you cant distinguish the different origins of life because of endosymbiosis horizontal gene transfer etc merging things together
  yes because of the overwhelming evidence
the following people should be thrown into a wood chipper    evolution deniers  moon landing deniers  flat earthers  antivaxxers  acupuncture believers  homeopathy believers  chiropractic believers  9/11 truthers  any other conspiracy theorists  anybody who believes in religion instead of objective scientificallyestablished fact
  do you believe in evolution  why  for lack of a better model that doesnt involve sky wizards that fits observations
  looks pretty badass
  we can observe it happening in quickly dieing species
  theory    let me guess you dont know what theory means 
  i do because it makes the most sense
  no i accept evolution
can u fags help me calculate how much does this weight    its a concrete plate with some dirt btw
use a scale
  i dont have one
  download precalculus book and calculate its volume then find density of material and apply it
  im not an engineer
  kys
  then make one like pic related the amount of water in the bucket will be proportional with the weight of the concrete plate 1l water  1kg
  dont forget the weight of the bucket
  im guessing the stone is like 2030 kg but i am not sure
  its not the hard part of engineering this is high school level shit
  1 volume of truncated cone google it  2 density of concrete 150 pcf
  truncated cone minus the hollow cylinder to be more exact
get a large measuring container  put it in  cover in plastic wrap beforehand   the displacement is the weight
      well youre just fucking worthless then arent you        a truncated cone is called a frustum
  you dont need to if you know the volume of the bucket and the amount of water in it
im putting together a team
count me in
no youre putting up a medal

  who is that guy
i have nothing left to conquer but your cause
alright medfags i really need your take about this one a shoulder fell upon
  im sorry it looks terminal that skeleton is going to get tired of being inside your body soon
  almost like nature is tired of you ever reproducing and thus keeping you in inceldom op i cant figure shit from this potato photo
  i dont know how it should be but that thing on the top left looks like it should join the other part after the gap conclusion its broken
  the radiopaque prominence distal to the 5th femtoscapular process is suspicious for malignancy likely metastatic cancer
  yup zoomers everyone cheers
  heh ive once heard about this whole joining business and about how it should be but then ive seen your terminal case masturbating in the mirror to your waifu moral of the story is youll never know how itll go
  take this note to nearest shaman and he will fix you right up
  yeah ive already figured that out from your epic memes you really deserve this shit
  how did you get an xray without a diagnosis
  op is probably from  also explains why he expects at least halfway competent people to frequent 4chan
wow this thread is a fucking joke kek
what is chinas space program like i know they have one but everyone seems to say it is mostly fluff what happens if it isnt and they actually start making colonies in space they tend to do crazy shit that other countries wont do i can see them colonizing the moon and mars despite all the problems and any mass deaths that may happen    will such a move kick start a new space race
their space program is decent but not amazing i would be very surprised if they managed a lunar landing before 2030 much less anything resembling colonization then again maybe im wrong which would be great
  if it lit a fire under nasa and esa all the better can you imagine secret military spending directed to nasa shiiit
  they have launched more than space x and the rest of world combined this year     you do the math
  what the hell are they putting up
  moon and wifi
  lol a moon  thats funny anon  oh you mean launch probes to the moon right  no wut  jesus fuck
  no one knows space x lady literally said that the government should be very concerned about it
  you dont have to imagine something thats already happening
  oh really looks like they are sitting on their thumbs to me
this is unfortunately what happens when you sacrifice maximum technological efficiency in your society to appease groups you feel sorry for through diversity hiring etc you get outcompeted by more ruthless less sentimental societies the destiny of mankind will pass out of our hands and into chinas
remember firefly tv series and the serenity movie chinese was the main language other than english because the chinese colonized a shit load before everyone else
    
  pentax astrotracer bro
  tiny periodic brightness fluctuations is proof of extrasolar planets  all those stars have planets with orbital planes that intersect our line of site  the absolute state of modern astronomy
    tiny periodic brightness fluctuations is proof of extrasolar planets    dips in brightness are periodic and consistent with an obstruction orbiting the star the existence of planets have also been validated with direct imaging    all those stars have planets with orbital planes that intersect our line of site    there are 400 billion stars in just our galaxy is it really out of the question for some of them to have an orbital plane that intersect our line of sight
    sorry but the pentax astrotracer is not a camera tracker it tilts the cmos sensor along the optical axis from inside the camera itself            it wouldnt work for long transiting events youre better off with an actual camera tracker either diy or commercial
  the existence of planets have also been validated with direct imaging  citation needed  afaik no telescope in existence has the angular resolution necessary to resolve planetsize objects lightyears away
  
  there are 400 billion stars in just our galaxy is it really out of the question for some of them to have an orbital plane that intersect our line of sight  there are 133 stars within 50 light years of the sun    39 30 of those stars including the closest star proxima centauri are confirmed to have exoplanets whose orbits directly intersect our line of sight to the star this is ridiculously improbable
  this is ridiculously improbable    from     geometric probability    transits can only be detected if the planetary orbit is near the lineofsight los between the observer and the star this requires that the planets orbital pole be within an angle of d/a part 1 of the figure below measured from the center of the star and perpendicular to the los where d is the stellar diameter 00093 au for the sun and a is the planets orbital radius    this is possible for all 2π angles about the los ie for a total of 4π d/2a steradians of pole positions on the celestial sphere part 2 of figure  thus the geometric probability for seeing a transit for any random planetary orbit is simply d/2a part 3 of figure borucki and summers 1984 koch and borucki 1996    geometry for transit probability   for the earth and venus this is 047 and 065 respectively see above table because grazing transits are not easily detected those with a duration less than half of a central transit are ignored since a chord equal to half the diameter is at a distance of 0866 of the radius from the center of a circle the usable transits account for 866 of the total if other planetary systems are similar to our solar system in that they also contain two earthsize planets in inner orbits and since the orbits are not coplanar to within 2d/d the probabilities can be added thus approximately 0011 x 0866  1 of the solarlike stars with planets should show earthsize transits
  the ridiculously improbable part is something which has 1 chance of happening being observed in 30 of cases  ridiculously improbable that the phenomena of slight periodic changes in stellar brightness are the due to extrasolar planet transits
  probability that 39 out of 133 stars will have planetary orbital plane orientation that has a 1 chance of occurring  133/39  00139  1  001133  39  13258528e78
      from     the orbits of the planets can be at any angle to our line of sight therefore the kepler mission is designed to look at more than 100000 stars to find the small percentage that will actually show transits for a jupitersize planet orbiting close to its star the chance of a transit is about 1 in 10 10 for an earthsize planet in an earthsize orbit the chance of it being aligned to produce a transit is less than 1    and that fits with the pattern of exoplanet discoveries with hot jupiters making up the majority of exoplanets discovered also that 1 odds for a planet like earth is for each individual planet star systems with multiple planets means that the odds of discovering at least one goes up especially for the ones that are closer to their parent star
  ok lets say they all have the high probability of 10 probability that 39 out of 133 stars will have planetary orbital plane orientation that has a 10 chance of occurring  133/39  0139  1  01133  39  17044447e43
  math is wrong  actual probability that 39 out of 133 stars have planets whose orbits intersect our line of site to the star  assuming such an orientation has a 10 likelihood of occurring is 33513904101660767e10  those are lotterytier odds    online calculator for anyone wanting to verify  
  could it be that the orbital planes have a preferential orientation
tfw motorized eq mount costs literally its weight in gold and too retarded to diy one  azimuthal suffering
  costs literally its weight in gold  i dont think theres anything more expensive than a 10 micron gm4000 mount which weighs 125kg and it goes for 2785700 which is considerably less than the cost of its weight in gold
  i tried for biology but citizen science can be too expensive
  not to mention the gm4000 has a payload capacity of 150 kg 330 lbs thats not even half the weight of a monster 16inch schmidtcassegrain        for anyone starting from scratch yes but if you already have a dslr they sell cheap camera trackers under 300 that can be mounted to a standard tripod then mount a 20 ball socket mount to the camera tracker from there all you need is a standard dslr and you wouldnt even need a telescope just a fixed focus lens or zoom lens that can lock the focus in place though if youre really strapped for cash some people have used something as simple as tape for their cheapo 100 zoom lens        this person bought a used lens for 92 and that worked
  150 kg 330 lbs thats not even half the weight of a monster 16inch schmidtcassegrain  just the ota weighs that much are you sure that doesnt include weight of a tripod and mount
tfw a gravitational lens telescope wont send back images of other planets in your lifetime
  i apologize i meant to say the monster 16inch schmidtcassegrain ota wouldnt even be half of the maximum weight limit of the gm4000        according to the official meade site their 16sc ota weighs only 67 lbs
  if nasa hurries up and develop fusion propulsion we could    
  citation needed  how out of the loop are you    as for transiting planets yes its only about 1 that line up with our solar system most detections are via transits because its easy with our current tech
  proxima b doesnt transit it was found using radial velocity of the 57 star systems known to have planets within 50 light years 3 of them were detected using the transit method the rest with radial velocity the transit detections include the trappist1 system which has 7 planets radial velocity is harder to do so far so we will invariably be skewed towards seeing transits but even so the number of lined up systems is not excessive  
    yeah well (((radial velocity))) is pretty suspect for a lot of reasons
  why dont you just cut to the case and say you dont believe astronomers didnt find any exoplanets at all
  those are point sources and not resolved
  so by your crackpot logic no star has been directly imaged because theyre all point sources except that one fatass star we got a disc of that one time  betelgeuse maybe
  dont believe astronomers didnt find  thats a double negative please learn proper english skills
  t doesnt know the sun is a star
  thats changing the subject do you believe scientists found exoplanets or not
  not according to the iau because it hasnt cleared its galactic orbit
  if you count forecasting economic variables as citizen science then sure
  radial velocity is suspect  you changes subject  english motherfucker  you thats changing the subject
  thats radial velocity is suspect learn to speak english first before you correct other peoples grammar
  just answer the question do you believe that astronomers found exoplanets or not
  astronomers have inferred the existence of exoplanets
  reflected light from the planet 51 pegasi b which was already discovered using the radial velocity method was detected        so thats two detection methods for the same exoplanet
  astronomers finding exoplanets is a fact not a matter of belief  read your stupid zombiejew book if you want belief
  oh sure (((5)))(((1))) (((pegasi))) (((b)))  more like 51 pegassi b amirite
  some stars have been resolved by using our largest telescopes but exoplanets have never been resolved read up on angular resolution and the definition of image resolving
  he said retreating into pedantic pointscoring after his baseless assumptions about all exoplanets being transiting had been destroyed utterly
  astronomers finding exoplanets is a fact not a matter of belief     was making posts to the contrary griping about astronomers declaring periodic dips in the light of some stars being caused by exoplanets    read your stupid zombiejew book if you want belief  im not a christfag fuckwit

how can one focus when they have schizophrenia
  disproving the riemann hypothesis
just be yourself man
  try eating large amounts of raw cacao must not be roasted or processed with alkali cold pressed and dried into a powder    may or may not make psychosis / hallucinations worse may or may not improve focus its worth trying
  actually on second thought it will very likely worsen any sort of psychosis try with great caution
  i dont know why but listening to rock music helps me
  take your meda
  how can one focus when they have adhd
  try very hard to get prescribed amphetamines by your psych hell instantly oppose you due to the misconception they cause psychosis but if he was well read hed know its genetic psychosis and not general this is of course ignoring the surprisingly positive studies surrounding amphetamines with anti psychotics in most cases

  no they havent   not like us anyway
  man theyve found heaps of shit like this theyve found screws hammers bolts even electrical shit embedded in bedrock which we know took millions of years to form    the fact is we arent the first intelligent species to evolve on this planet and we know that any intelligent species that does evolve will have to use tools      nice way to try to discredit the whole story without adding any constructive argument this has nothing to do with religion faggot

sorry op but anthropology is not a science just as geology is not    how to tell if x is a science  the whole field isnt populated with wild speculation  the whole field isnt upended regularly with any mild discovery  there is a way to verify hypothesis that doesnt rely on pure speculation    thanks
  please give me links to said articles that state/debut pictures of objects embedded in bedrock or similar    i wont be accepting the axe that very well couldve formed naturally other evidence is welcome
can someone explain how to fill in the blanks with the info provided missed my lecture on markup  help
ok accounting is not science anon if youre gonna make a homework help post stick it in /sqt/
  my uni literally offers a course called accounting sciences    300 is 125 of the cost so the cost is 240  the difference is the amount of markup 60  rate of markup is the ratio of markup to the whole price 20    if the markup is 3325 of the price then the cost is 6675 so the price is 9288  the markup is 3325 of that so 3088  rate of markup is markup over cost so 4981    if i made any mistakes its because im literally not a fucking accountant
  oooooh you wanted the method  let mathmarkup mu  pricepandcostcthenpc1 mu/math
  s  c  gm  now plug the values in and solve for the missing term gross margin is relative to either cost or selling price so use either of those terms when appropriate    t accounting brainlet
  my uni literally offers a course called accounting sciences  doesnt make it a science
hello /sci/ i see many intelligent people here and want to ask if it is normal to have extremely poor memory for example i never remember anything shortterm such as conversations tasks books movies tv shows and dreams  i need to write down things to do on a list and have a schedule or i will forget and possibly double book/schedule its affecting me at work and my relationships with friends and the girl friend sometimes i wonder if my memories are real or if i experienced a lifelike dream i probably forgot most if not every movie and tv show ive seen over a year ago    people can recall conversations and sometimes events with me that i have no recollection of its very depressing actually    my question is  is this normal or some sort of mental disorder is there any proven mental exercises i can do and does anyone else here experience similar traits as me
  how much time do you spend with technology be it computers smartphones video games tv etc
  sort of unrelated to your post but significant memories are just a blur for me and have no real weight attached to them i recently thought about a great achievement i made this year and literally felt nothing about it even though it took me years to attain its like im always living by the moment and not storing memories in a visceral way
  put it this way i work 50 hours a week and when im not working almost all of my free time goes into some sort of those technologies
  from what ive read a large contributor to retention of information is how frequently those memories are actively thought about with the necessary frequency becoming longer compared to last time or rather to have the highest likelihood of keeping dispositional knowledge it must be occurrent knowledge with decreasing frequency or even another way to explain it because im too drink to be sure that was clear your likelihood of remembering something goes up if you think about something more often to maximize retention vs time spent thinking you need to think about it with decreasing regularity        my theory is that you dont ever think about those things youre probably so engrossed in work or whatever problem youre working on that you dont think about those things so they dont get retained i dont remember peoples names because i hear it and dont ever think about it again because i dont care at least until i have a reason to be interested in them as a person     does this rationale seem to fit your situation
  i feel like this too there is so much information that people for instance colleagueor or my girlfriend must remind me of    when i was younger my family jokingly used to call me prof because i was so very distracted all the time now that im 25 i just struggle to keep up with remembering everything that im expected to remember    this sometimes becomes uncomfortable or embarassing especially at work where i understand that i ask the same questions twice within a 510m period    so i guess i can chip in to tell that i too experience similar traits as you op
  it certainly seems like this is the major contributing factor however im not entirely sure if this is entirely the case with me for example i also have a mild speech impediment because i cant remember how to pronounce words although i can spell them and understand their complete meaning       i can relate to this entirely      good to know im not alone if only there was a solution
i dont understand the concept of dummy variables in multiple regression how can your model be accurate if you randomly assign values to different levels
  anon you know how like some posters will say something retarded and when theyre called out on it they simply claim they were merely pretending imagine that but in terms of variables essentially by using a 0 or 1 you can bait the regression to model a categorical variable of course you and i anon know that its merely pretending
  a dummy variable is just a binary variable put into a regression if the value of the dummy variable is zero its as if the variable was never there but if its one it essentially moves the intercept of the regression equation up or down by the value of the coefficient
    who the fuck calls these dummy variables
  ive never heard them called anything else other than binary variables but usually ive only ever heard the usage of dummy variable in the context of regression analysis
  ive only heard them called indicator variables or onehot in a context with many categories
dummy variables only take on 0 or 1 as values so if were regressing wage wed have female as a dummy variable and its coefficient would be whatever you could add another dummy variable that is whether or not you have a high school diploma or if you can read or not the purpose of the dummy variables is to allow us to more closely describe the relation of whatever variable were actually interested in
  people doing statistics
    the first thing you do when making a statistic is you make assumptions about what is a suitable model for the data if you use a linear model then you assume the relation between predictor independent explanatory x variable and response dependent observation y variable to be linear if you want to incorporate a categorical binary variable eg x  male female you can do so by introducing a dummy variable x that is eg 1 for x  male and 1 for x  female since you are using a linear model the dummy variable has its own coefficient βi that will be adjusted to optimally fit the model to the data so you assume that the influence of sex is a constant offset which moves the line along the y direction this might be a decent approximation eg if you want to predict income based on various socioeconomic factors and sex then the income will be higher for x  male than for x  female by 2βi this assumption might of course be completely wrong or result in a poor approximation of what you are trying to model with your model
tell me /sci/ what do you think of these fields
  its mostly for the dumb
  why it is rather quite rare to see a for example maths or further maths major gain some highly respected position of actual influence most just die somewhat well respected but eventually fading into obscurity
  they are for people with a high verbal iq good verbal reasoning and great imagination unlike     personally i love philosophy psychology and literature they are half of my favorite subjects the other half belongs to the somewhat harder sciences but etiher wqays im really fond of these fields )))
history   pretty based and historybros always have good stories to tell actually understand how to look at a situation objectively no problem with these guys    literature   most have over inflated egos and are dispossessed because their shitty book didnt sell pretend to seek knowledge but dont pursue anything at depth exceptions for computational linguistics     philosophy   modern philosophy is full of faggots playing word games peaked in the mid 20th century if a philosopher doesnt have another area of expertise they are an absouelte fraud    psychology   couldnt hack it in neuroscience psychology  neuroscience is based
  history  not different from being religious you just choose to believe anything some people say cant check the trueness and cant even practically use that knowledge though analysis as an equivalent of spiritual practice is obviously good for you  literature  absolutely essential but one should be careful since some authors are depressed and have some really pathetic worldview  philosophy  absolutely essential but one should be careful since some authors are depressed and have some really pathetic worldview philosophy of suicide is truly pitiful  psychology  absolutely essential should be studied at middle school along with logic lots of practical usage and just helpful information
history  you can check trueness up to a certain relatively recent time period that knowledge is always used practically you got yourself a history it means you got yourself a nation and a people and thats very powerful just see how basically every modern nation state created itself within its new borders  literature  an art that shouldnt be a formal degree as a academic field its mostly bullshit  philosophy  complex and beautiful poses important problems as a academic field its mostly boring all the energy is wasted trying to outsmart others and prove that hey philosophy is important too lets discuss refugee crisis and data science philosophically  psychology  yeah nice theory good to know not trustable and also fuck evolutionary psychology
  fuck evolutionary psychology  evo psych studies are among the most replicable studies in modern day psychology what turned you off from evo psycho anon
  wow i guess if you write a book about your life i can just say how can we prove its true and tell everyone you never existed
a man who is not at least familiar with shakespeare homer dante and plato can never be a real intellectual
  well thats exactly what i mean you shouldnt just believe what is written or said without logical analysis at very least until you see it yourself unless you got that superb intuition or other insight thing that has validated itself on practice if its even real in your world view if you dont have such superpower while believing highly biased topics like history or even science for that matter without using your brain then youre no better than religious fanatics sadly most people in the world dont question their believes and dont like to think for themselves
  philosophy student here history is great and literature and psychology are alright in my humble opinion philosophy and math are the two most important intellectual endeavours one can undertake they are necessary and sufficient physics is a close second and is sufficient but not necessary as is everything else      nb something id be careful admitting in public especially in academia is that most philosophy is either a regurgitation or b selfcongratulatory or c pointless my opinion may change but as of now i dont admire philosophers who philosophize for philosophys sake if theres no essential telos to your work that is if youre just a scholar of philosophy you shouldnt represent the field
  all four are great with philosophy being my favorite of them if not for math and physics id probably be a humanitiesfag but i kinda am one desu
  all pretty based and important in their own way  you never know too much about anything ever
  because while you dream of being gandalf the grey or creating girls with cat ears while you dream of casting lightning from your fingers and freezing time and space to live eternitities while you dream of expanding our knowledge to the furthest reaches of the universe and beyond   we are doing it
ive just started a degree in engineering which ive been excited about for such a long time like a number of aspiring engineers in the world im very idealistic i want to use my problemsolving ability and creativity to best help humanity and aspire to end up in a rd position    naturally i know im not going to go on like a tony starkesque figure creating clean energy in my basement but as my degree progresses and i look to a masters and hopefully future phd which discipline of engineering can best allow me to do that im very interested in robotics in that it would allow me to combine aspects of both me and ee while working on projects that can increase efficiency through automation or provide relief during humanitarian crises conversely im also interested in renewable energy technologies with an obvious benefit for the world but appreciate that would perhaps limit me more to ee i love tinkering with and making actual mechanical things while also enjoying ee    im very early in my engineering career but im really keen to use my life in the best possible way to help others thats my only motivator and im not motivated at all by money any and all advice would be greatly appreciated
tfw there will never be a good dark tower film or tv series
  im a me graduate and aspire to enter the renewables market theres just as much ee as me in renewables the electrical aspect behind it is obviously important but mechanical engineers are always finding way to improve mechanical efficiency and produce innovative solutions even with solar tech there is a need for mechanical engineers to model thermal behaviour and distribution    mechanical engineering can come into almost any industry if you give it a bit of thought ill give you an example like where i currently work im in the electric motor industry but mechanical engineers largely outweighs electrical engineers in our design team since we need to model thermal behaviour design the structure and housing of the motor develop cad models simulate fluid flow etc
best career to pursue with a master in psychology
  sandwhich artist
md and get a real specialty like psychiatry
    have you considered ufo research
  the profession is for brainlets a master in psychology do you get that from reading some wikipedia pages
  i forgot how elitist this board was
fyi a german mailman pretended to have a phd in psychology and got to be the senior physician at zschadraß forensic psychiatry
    forgot the link sorry you got scammed out of your money  
  we hate all pseudoscience equally
  i thought this board was meant to be smart and then i see shit like this and remember everyone here is just a teenager and people actually believe this
  lisa homemaking can be very rewarding
  do human factors you can easy make over 6 figures after a few years
  or youre just a big nigger and got trolled by some faggots why dont you go back to reit so this doesnt happen to you again i bet they love you for your psychology degree
  nobody with a real degree respects psychologists thats a thot subject
  last weekend i fucked that hot psychology chick  thinking_emoji psychiatrists are the same its the female science/medical profession for their lesser interllect
can i get some actual suggestions rather than everyone shitting on my degree i chose it because i love the mind and studying how it works i also enjoy group tests and analysing people i dont give a fuck if im not as smart as some physicists or whatever that shits just boring to me maybe if you guys actually followed your passion this board wouldnt be full of threads about people wanting to kill themselves
  if you want status and easy work just work as a clinical psychologist if you want money or want to help people get a different degree
  you may stomp your boots on the creeping shadows but theyll never submit to your will  your profession wasnt made out to be a big career opportunity
  barista
  do creative writing courses for middleschool children
  followed your passion    kek enjoy your passion 10 years down the line
  i dont want some big rising career were i make millions if i did i wouldnt be in this field im just wondering about what i can potentially do with the degree      yeah i think the best thing i can do is clinical       stay jaded kid
  if you acquire your degree at a good uni then you should have good statistical skills which are highly sought after in the labor market  source msc in statistics and phd in psych and have seen lots of pure psych colleagues pursue dataanalytical jobs
  this is good advise thank you
  he was very passionate in spending money on it somehow he believes this secoundary course will get him any laurels in real life or he just didnt understand what his profession was to begin with i mean hes asking us the elitest 4chan suicidal anime retards what career he should aspire after getting a masters degree in psychology i guess were the real losers here
  seething
  of course
  good job capitalising your words i dont think we could have understood you otherwise
its another episode of anon thinking psychology is a science
  will they ever learn
  op here i dont think this at all i know i didnt study proper science
  this desu psychology is going through a major replication crisis
so basically im working on some excel data sheets for a project one of em is a database with data linked on another sheet for formulas and shit now what i need to do is add extra rows on top of the existing data rows without fucking up my existing formulas on another sheet as it would shift everything is there some non retarded way for doing it
just use a programming language ffs
is there anyway to restart your university career i fucked up and i want a fresh start can i just apply to another university and just give them my high school grades
sure and depending on the situation you can utilize your university credits too
  i know theres no restarts thats not what lifes about but my thoughts were so loud i couldnt hear my mouth    
  tell me more anon
computer scientists with no education in biology want to recreate intelligence    is it because their are dumb
  yes i dont fucking get it either the only intelligence we know of is based on chemicals and these retards think the optimal way of recreating it is using a fucking piece of metal
  only communications we knew was glyphs and sounds and somehow these retards made it into piece of metal and intelligence doesnt go far beyond what you can communicate maybe its you who is retarded
  yeah maybe thats why they fail so much 70 years of research billions of dollars and the state of the art is a computer that can play a board game
  youre missing out really important stuff there is computer that can make a voice call to book you a meeting at hairdresser      biology doesnt understand intelligence very much
matematicians hold our beer
  yeah dudeeeee like the human brain really crazy stuff uh almost like magic bro
  biology doesnt understand intelligence very much  exactly the reason why all the funding should have gone into neuroscience in the first place
  really important stuff  book you a meeting at a hairdresser    t computer scientists
  it is because they spite nature organic functions and everything that cannot fit exactly into objective neverchanging functions they wish to replace god with himself to have an ultimate control over each and every aspect of that which can be considered life i am led to believe this is due to the extreme autism and antipiety required to flourish in higher levels of computatuonal theory
  maybe i actually really am retarded because i didnt get your post at all
  metal isnt a chemical
  i meant based on chemical transmission as opposed to electric and i admit i phrased it as an idiot
  so its because they cant get laid
  i dont think biology even has it covered consciousness is poorly understood in its role of intelligence
  engineers with no education in avian biology want to recreate flight
  chemicals that are only used to induce a transfer of electron potential
about half of the phds at deepmind are neuroscientists
    computers were invented to replicate abstract human thought
  not him but communication also didnt start as technology yet here we are    perhaps computers etc are not the optimal way but science often is less often about that  we are pushing our limits on all the fields our chemistry is clearly further away from intteligence than our computer systems are
  no  neurotransmitters are not just there to carry or attenuate the signal from neuron a to neuron b it is just as crucial to the function as any other part  you could just as well say the electric potential is only there to induce the influx of calcium at the synapse   neurotransmitters dont just magically tell the cell downstream to fire and then disappear    if we replaced every chemical synapse in your brain with a direct electrical synapse you would be dead
no one has a fucking clue concerning consciousness if they say so they are lying out their ass  right now we understant the core of stars billions of light years away better than the thing that makes us able to know about them  science sure is one hell of a ride
i guess what i mean is transmitters and receptors dont just carry the signal they modulate it  and they dont just modulate it they modulate it conditionally based on thousands of weird chemical parameters that we dont even fully understand in nature yet the system isnt static at all its constantly upregulating and downregulating and reuptaking and shitting out gases that synapse in reverse and all other manner of weird chemical bullshit    im not saying computers cant ever emulate this but modeling our thought process with simple electrical synapses is never going to get us far
  no it is because they are arrogant the probability that a cell gets created randomly out of acids is about as high as a microchip randomly being created out of sand and rare earth laying close to each other only god can create life and consciousness no human can and will ever be able to
  there i bit  heres your fucking you happy
  he thinks evolution creates systems in an optimal way
  based and redpilled
  people in the research field dont want to recreate human intelligence the idea is to study the forms of intelligence defined as the ability to perform tasks tasks defined as computable processes for which intelligence decides on a finite series of steps until it can halt and the problem is solved that arent necessarily tied to human intelligence evolutionary and biology inspired solutions lead to things like neural nets and genetic algorithms but the study of ai at large machine learning or otherwise concerns the ability to accumulate experience and integrate it into a decision making system that is not necessarily tied to the way humans do it    t phd student who hates machine learning
  neuroscience is easier with good machines      its important step in future of ai
  the vertebrate eye isnt optimal  having our photoreceptors in the back is a feature not a bug  in vertebrate eyes the photoreceptors are right on top of the pigmented epithelium so they get more light   ever wondered why many albinos are legally blind melanin absorbs light the rpe is a major part of what makes our eyes work at all octopuses do not and cannot have this layer with their backwards setup    our photoreceptors are also closer to the choroid blood supply which is the main source of nutrients and cleanup for the eye birds exclusively get blood from here and a lot of it which is partially where we get eagle eyes from   octopuses have to rely on the slower supply of blood from the back of the retina through all the nerves all the way to the photoreceptors its a design flaw in the octopus eye that limits nutrient flow to the most important structure    and there is no visual impairment caused by the inversion the choroid layer is transparent and the cortex is developed to account for it in fact some of the glial cells here actually guide light to improve vision here muller cells actually funnel light into rods and cones to enhance them   and neither the blind spot nor the blood vessel shadow impact fitness  also we have cones and they dont not an inversion issue but it should be mentioned    there are no downsides to this setup   vertebrate eyes are not backwards they are exactly the way they need to be the octopus eye trades acuity for simplicity a feature in and of itself
read a few articles about epigenetics being heritable including a few postulates that the holocaust will cause genetic stress patterns in genetic code of offspring for generations though my hunch is to call this bs and a thought occurred to me     if epigenetic patterns and triggers are heritable or going a step even further are capable of modifying underlying genetic code in a heritable manner wouldnt that validate lamarakian genetics at lease being responsible for a proportion of evolutionary patterns    questions on deterministic reality and the nature of randomness on 4chan kek

  daily reminder that if we continue as we are now everyone will sterilized    everyday until you get it
  other planets of course  what didyou think we would work only on getting longer lives and not building space colonies too  first great crusade when
turbo autism itt
  immediatly   we must commence the summoning of the omissiah   gather the magi the druids the sages the gurus and the shamans we will sacrifice them all to bring him into this world then chaos will flee evil will be struck at the root good will triumph order restored to the galaxy
so what makes this time any different than the last times    
what do you mean
  we are going  we are nasa
  nasa is trying to help spur a business case for the moon so exploration and development happens there without needing nasa for example its possible that if one or more of these companies succeeds in developing a viable lunar lander then various academic government and scientific interests will pay the the companies to bring their payloads to the moon so we might start seeing something like the iss where instead of a rocket carrying a bunch of different organizations research projects to the iss we would see them being delivered to the moon instead    if this works then it may significantly drive down the cost of delivering payloads to the moon
  i dont care about the moon or mars anymore i just want them to be jailed for embezzling the sls money
oh and the next major program should be a program like this but for midsized landers in the early 2020s after that large landers would follow in the mid2020s nasa is pushing this pretty hard
      ive been looking into moon based industry and it seems like there is a serious shortage of certain elements which would greatly facilitate refining processes in particular    im just not sure that this is a good way to go about things we are going to reach a point where boosting heavy things into orbit becomes obsolete    is this really the best application of funds    wouldnt it be more prudent to focus on manufacturing techniques and moon industry startup
  making use of lunar resources is one of the long term goals of these programs
  so what makes this time any different than the last times    commercial approach similar to what gave us spacex gets toxic politicians and nasa bureaucrats out of the way this could actually be successful
nasa wants to do pic rel even if lunar stations either on the ground or on orbit are not strictly necessary for a mars mission it would make doing mars missions more efficient while also giving nasa considerably more options in case something goes wrong    for example consider the classic problem of a return vehicles tiling being broken as was the case on the columbia nasa could scrub the landing have the astronauts wait at a lunar station while sending a new vehicle same if theres an issue on launch and they dont want to scrub the entire mission before burning for mars
  asteroids have everything youre missing im not joking but its going to be fucking horrible getting it set up
  the lunar station is a different program this is for small commercial lunar landers
woke up an hour ago in yuropoor  moon next to a crazy bright star right over the horizon  look out window again half an hour later  moon and star higher on the sky but same distance from each other  shouldnt the moon have moved closer to the star would imagine the moon moving faster across the sky than the background stars
the moon takes a month to orbit the earth meanwhile the stars are effectively stationary relative to the earths position neglecting rotation  so basically all the motion you see star and moon apparent position in the sky is due to the earths rotation in half an hour the moon gains about a quarter of a degree of arc relative to the stars which is too small for the eye to notice    theres also a good chance the star was actually venus bright star visible in the east just before sunrise but that doesnt really change things
  a crazy bright star  pretty sure its mars   its pretty bright right now and near the moon in the evenings after sunset

  serves you right cheater coffee is what real men use for brain enhancement
    brain enhancement    that means coffee is a nootropic
  spbp    what nootropics
calc 1 student here if you mean nootropics as in adderall meaning speed me too i took adderall for 2 years straight    now i take caffiene pills instead     my brain was fucked when i quit adderall like a year ago but has recovered since then    just take fish oil supps to help regrow/preserve the brain works very slowly
im just use coffee  theanine are there any other things that you can take long term without huge consequences
as long as you werent doing any really crazy shit you will reset to baseline it just takes time
  task positive network  intelligent  task negative network  imaginative  if you take nootropics youll enhance the task positive network at the expense of the task negative network duh
  which ones  i wish id lose interest sex without antiandrogenic or serotonergic effects  celibacy/semen rention is the greatest nootropic i have ever experience

/sci/ do we really need soap on our skin    cant i just take cold showers
  nah
  proof or gtfo  also do you guys use soap
with all the scents and perfumes pumped into cleansers i discovered that soap doesnt actuallydeodorize it simply adds a mild top layer of fragrance which evaporates within a few hours anyway
  /sci/ do we really need soap on our skin  why dont you try it and find out
  you still need something to get the excess scum off your skin  you can go full roman and lather yourself in olive oil and scrape it off with a stick you can take smoke baths or use something mildly abrasive to scour your skin  you can go buy some of that pine tar soaps if you want to get away from the shit in most name brand soaps
  i havent showered in almost 3 weeks your skin will start to accumulate dirt under it that you need to scrub quite vigorously to get off i just used my bare knuckles to scrub it off but youd probably have better luck with some sort of scrubbing apparatus i dont use soap either anyway my skin looks a lot cleaner after that so the buildup is significant id recommend showering at least once every 710 days to avoid too much buildup twice a week probably ideal also i wash my junk in the tub almost daily because that gets nasty fast also use a bidet when i shit
  if its cold every other day  if its hot every fucking day sometimes twice just to wash the salt off
  do you need soap  every once and a while yeah i would assume its good to use soap i dont use soap but am going to buy some today because you made this bad thread and seemed self conscious about it you didnt make me self conscious but i think id like some soap just to say im not like  not that it bothers me but knowing how disgusting and weak some people are i always take that as an opportunity to use my own will power to be stronger and less repulsive to myself you should do the same op i use whatever they have whole foods or ill have my mom order me something good from wherever it is she gets my soap from you should ask your mom to do the same thats what theyre for
  dont worry anon i can soap your skin for you
  real talk use a good soap i recommend dr (((bronners))) its got none of the bullshit most products do
cursed math images
  complex plane has four infinities  so which one is the result of  eqn1i cdot infty /eqn  
  ask the author  spoiler he doesnt understand shit about infinity  
im not going to bother fishing up the image but heres an old classic sure to piss people off    let a  b  therefore  a2  ab  a2  b2  ab  b2  a  b a  b  b a  b  a  b  b  b  b  b  2b  b  2  1
  oops that fifth one should be a  b  a  b  b a  b    its also where this whole thing falls apart if you actually try to figure out the trickery because ab equals 0 because a  b so when you simplify it by dividing those out youre dividing by 0
  or no wait im just stupid and it is supposed to be the first way anyway the divide by 0 thing is still correct
      yeah that was a pretty fun youtube video
  sounds like bullshit you can go in any direction away from a point so there should be an infinite amount of infinities  real numbers have two inf and inf
there is one infinity in the complex plane you can approach it going in any direction i guess complex analysis isnt a prerequisite here
  based onepoint compactification poster
  haha do you even know what stoneczeh compactification is
  plzzz
where my riemann sphere bois at
  lol in what book can i find that
  i mean if a and b  0 then everything works except 2  1
  a and b could equal anything they could equal 4589 for all it matters theyre just a and b  even if they equal 0 you still arent supposed to do the simplification between steps 3 and 4 because its still dividing out a  b which will always be 0 no matter what they represent people miss that part because theyre just skimming through it and you can use similar equations to prove that anything equals anything else
c u r s e
  but that result is absolutely correct with the power of the empty set at your disposal anything follows

healthfags get in here    i recently 2days have been having slight pressure at the midpoint to base of my penis head when i take a piss and it causes slight discomfort after im done i guess a mild burning if i lightly squeeze it right at that spot i get a sharp mild pain like if you had a cut and moved it the wrong way    never had this happen before and i dont have an sti unless my partner has been sleeping around which i highly doubt since she works with me and we basically see each other 24/7     what could be wrong with me
i did use dish soap the other day to jerk it i couldve gotten some in thereim not sure how bad that shit is
  what could be wrong with me  who knows drink a bunch of water to flush yourself out and take some vitamin c it may just be a uti that goes away on its own
  if only this wasnt a blue board theres a small white circle in my dick hole approximately 12 cm is it a uti or something different 0
could be an ulcer or a blister    if there was any white powdery discharge it could be a uti    i had painful urination pain which persisted in combination with cloudy whit discharge on and off for most of my life i was convinced i had a uti but tests and doctors denied it    years later i find out through my own research how diet can result in the formation of certain crystals within the bladder sharp ones which abrade on the way out    useless doctors havent had a problem since
  well im thinking that i might have gotten dish soap the kind that you use on literal dishes to get rid of grease inside it as per       my diet hasnt changed and ive never gotten this before so im not sure     but yeah i only have bad experiences with doctors they never actually listen to 90 of what my symptoms are and i always get misdiagnosed the first time so i rarely go anymore
  medical student and phd here its the soap i thought every red blooded male would have known this by now relax
  what the fuck were you eating
  i forget specifically but removing certain food additives from my diet has fixed the problem for the most part they were binding to something else in my bladder and forming crystals i assume    i have to be careful of stuff like raw spinach even when its young as well    inherited susceptibility i suppose my dad said it happens to him a lot too

  dunno but mine was a shamefully low 22 the only thing worse wouldve been a third which is suicide territory    in theory it doesnt matter so long as youre in that class of degree ie it doesnt matter if you got 50 or 59 but they have academic transcripts that some employers will check which would make it clear that i was at the lower end       which job after how long searching
tell me why this drills head should not be toroidal    protip you cant
lmao you mean with a hole in the center what would you do with the 20 foot diameter cylinders if rock
    because then you have this giant chunk of rock that falls off inside the toroid causing the machine to seize unless a giant rock crusher is put there this is harder than just doing it the current way of a giant spinning disk    but the basic idea works since blast mining uses a series of drilled shafts for the same basic result but faster at the expense of increased manpower for an evolution of this concept look at the nuclear subterrene halfexposed nuclear reactor that would melt rock using a series of tubes rather than explosives which is the same idea but more efficient
  if rock what    also id do what you are doing with the holes in the current one and thats to transport the drilled matter out of the tunnel
  i dont understand the machine is a giant rock crusher isnt it also  nuclear subterrene  pics or didn happen
  nuclear reactor that would melt rock  i can imagine its also more efficient in poisoning the environment

  everything he said is a myth     water vapor      medieval warm period      temperature has not increased       all tired and old arguments  he is also wrong in thinking there was a change is terminology going from global warming to climate change    it just never fucking ends with you guys its the same shit over and over again on repeat fucking hell
  (((skeptical science)))
    
bump
  solar activity all along it was the sun that was in control it is the modulatory machine of our solar system no different than a crystal oscillator is used as a clock
use hundreds of massive oil pipelines to dump increased sea levels into the middle of the american african and east asian deserts  use hundreds of massive carbon scrubbers to absorb all the increased co2 in the atmosphere compress it in metal tankers and store them literally anywhere  boom climate change defeated  but that would be expensive  money is a fictitious concept on the level of international governments like the united states china and the european union
  dump saltwater into the desert
  explain your problem with it
  two things jump out at me  1 you wont magically make fertile soil by dumping water over sand youll just make floods and a lot of mud  2 by using saltwater you ruin any possibly useful soil and make it hard to grow anything there   the area will go back to being a desert for the same reason its a desert now anyways
  so the intent is to combat rising sea levels having another dead sea isnt any worse than having a flooded east coast
the two party system doesnt want you to know climate change is beatable
  this mega billion dollar conglomerate energy and agrotech companies who own our politicians and are all connected through investors and bod to deep state people dont want you to know they can sell you a solution to climate change while still burning fossil fuels and dumping pesticides in the water supply get dabbed on shitlib pessimist puss boys
  money is a fictitious concept on the level of international governments like the united states china and the european union  what do you mean
  the united states is 20 trillion in debt and fine they pay all their bills while in the red every year if they say they want to spend a trillion dollars throwing water in the desert over the next five years itll happen
  not understanding how the petrodollar works
  i will consider reading this if you use punctuation
do humans get glitches
  yes theyre called mental disorders
    dude in pic related is probably having a seizure
  deja vu already seen
yes  mutation  metabolism imbalance   this
  yeah when rna is making dna there can be kinks in the process where segments get skipped thats part of how radiation gives people cancer beta and gamma waves can provide energy two segments of dna causing them to fuse inappropriately those fused sections get skipped and can result in mutation that can be passed on if not corrected by removal by the bodies immune system
  i get this so often nowdays i wonder if its bad
  a glitch is when something doesnt function as intended    there is no intent for the human condition it just is
  optimized
  humans dont have reverse transcriptase nignog i think you mean dna pol also you got the rest of it wrong unless you meant tt fusion by uv rays its usually either depurination which is repaired by dna pol passing over it mutation of a base to another usually cu which has to be excised and replaced before dna replication by dna pol or mutagens the only time you get skipped sections is if the template strand slips causing deletions if the coding strand slips then you get insertions       there is a clear intent in that all your biological processes are geared towards retaining homeostasis we are alive because of our ability to mold our environment both on the microscopic and macroscopic level through a series of reactions so just being is our intent
  that isnt what intent is  youd have something resembling a good argument if it was absolutely universal that our biological processes were geared towards homeostasis but reproduction does not contribute to homeostasis    you could say that the fulfillment of a reproductive drive is a resolution of the tension arising from the compulsion to reproduce but that calls the existence of the compulsion into question our functions are unquestionably more complex than what youre claiming
  of course retard  i had a glitch a few days ago meaning i got drunk took half my klonopin prescription and woke up the next morning on the floor of my kitchen
  it happens from time to time to me too when it happens i inmediately try to put together that moment and think why do i have this memory from wherei dont have a good conclusion it really feels like a glitch
  were all being given brain damage by wireless devices and probably aluminum deployed in the atmosphere legitimate answer because ive suffered the same its begun to reverse with use of antioxidants nac and coq10 horsetail is used for a source of silica to bind the aluminum oxide nanoparticles in the body as aluminum silicates are able to be removed
  i dont know man my balls need to be drained from time to time
  but that doesnt require reproduction i can drain them for you
  no homo
are artists genetically different from normal logical human beens
yes they have a specialized art gland behind their left nipple
  this seems made up
  can i please get a more serious answer
  no ive had periods of my life when i was extremely creative and everything and anything was turned to creative use and ive had and am in periods where deduction rigidity and sterile thinking dominates a state where accuracy and truth is the overarching theme and other elements translations and so forth are actually actively walled off and filtered out before they reach the conscious mind    id also reject the dichotomy as well creativity can provide an interface and bridge between different aspects of a topic and it really does write itself at that point    in the creative state i started creating alters to encapsulate different skills and allow rapid information uptake and storage these were subsets of a governing superstructure which was really just living at a low level layer close to the real superstructure that tracks aspects of the minds global state it was awful eventually and i lost control because anything make yourself do consciously for long enough with few exceptions will become automatic    so the answer is maybe ive always kind of been both and i found a way to push various parts of me to their extreme i would assume that its not strictly genetic though there is a birth component much of it is learned
does the empty function have a derivative
does the empty function have a derivative  what have you tried
  the empty function i want to know if it has a derivative
  define an empty function
  
  the empty function has no domain on which to define a derivative
  yes the empty function is differentiable everywhere its derivative is itself
    undergrads    f    1  f   111  11  1  happy now
  define define an empty function
  0/10 too obvious and not funny
  you need to take limits to get derivatives how do you take the limit of something with an empty domain you cant
  low iq
  is the empty set a differential structure on an empty set
  i suppose if the universals and existentials are in the right places it could make sense
how flawed or accurate is this personality test
  how flawed or accurate is this personality test  completely flawed since psychology is not a science
  not even the scientific community accepts it it is a novelty at best
  there is bullshit in assuming ones personality is purely static being one one side of a chart and not going in another 4 times this error    eg introversion and extroversion can coeexist in one person not cancelling each other out
  lol its not even psychology its pscyhoanalysis and psychology is a science just not the popular articles that you see on the internet  the more scientific model is the big five traits of personality
measure personality through 4 metrics  place person in one of 16 categories according to said metrics  its not bad but its not very good either its just descriptive you cant use it to make predictions or to analyse someones behaviour it just serves to make vague generalisations like one of the downsides of being too goal oriented is you may forget to have fun or stuff like that  it isnt very accurate either since you may be between 4555 on one or more metrics and youll end up in completely different categories  all in all theres not much to say about it it may describe personality archetypes kinda sorta well but apart from that its pretty much useless
  this is the best answer its not great but its not astrology either
the most redeeming quality of the mbti is it gave us this
  mbti is the exact same thing as big 5 sans the neuroticism trait just with different names the entire psychology field is a scam at worst and a cultural phenomena at best even psychiatry has lacked any progress in the recent decades all it does is throw stuff at the wall to see what sticks without any sort of predictive model of the brain but hey at least its better than the lobotomies of old
  of course not  look up the lexical hypothesis and read the meaning of the various traits and aspects  sure there are some correlations but this is not true at all
  the difference is that one was made up by jung while the other was made up by arbitrarily grouping words from a dictionary either way they arrived at the same general traits and then looked for ways to interpret the world around those ideas dont let the data distract you from the huge methodological flaws in this
well i suppose im not giving due credit to the lexical hypothesis but plenty of criticism has been written about it already theres no need to repeat it
  even psychologists laugh at mbti
  the answers people give tend to be correlated with each other which makes me think the test reflects some sort of difference but its probably something totally irrelevant to your overall actual behavior
  wrong its not just using words from a dictionary theres a whole theoretical framework
  thats why i added this 
    horoscope for people who dont believe in astrology
  and support too and criticisms of the criticisms and so on but you dont care about making some literature review that weighs the criticisms and support for the theory
  nothing but another manifestation of the perennial and incessant psychological need for most individuals to feel special and valuable  the proverbial jerking yourself off
my gut feeling for a long time has been that human height and for that matter iq much less highly related to genetics than is commonlyheld    obviously convention holds that im wrong as fuck    
  my gut tells me that you are right as fuck
  accurate genomic prediction of human height 
  stephen hsu and his team managed to predict height within 1 inch with genetics only im lazy as fuck so i wont click that link   but i guess its that      any anons thought about height increase after epyphiseal closure  seems to be possible to induce hyaline cartilage hypertrophy and some shit with the pi3k pathway with a little dose of hgh/cjc 1925  hexarelin
  why would you want to increase height as a man  make yourself small and maximize women so we can have an amazon utopia
  also iq is as much epigenetics as genetics what if nobody gace a fuck about von neumann when he was a child  there are some papers about this laying around
  i dont remember the exact figure but in genetics classes undergrad i heard that height is something like 70 genetic and 30 nutrition
    i think my point wasnt that certain genes arent associated with height but that theyre only associated with height now in this particular social cultural and economic climate you can also predict someones potential for good or bad health based on their zip code  i realize that this is not a published study i keep finding references to the robustness of similar claims but not the studies that back them however if youll indulge my hypocrisy and what seems to be a settled matter within the sociological community youll note that its not literally the location of ones birth that causes health outcomes but other factors associated with it to create a link so strong that it partially obfuscates the complexity of the mechanisms underlying the link    similarly i wonder or perhaps hold that the socioeconomic status that arises indirectly out of genetic factors is what is so closely tied to height in other words there are genetic lines that tend to be financially successful or that otherwise find it easier to grow tall given the current food stock climate etc not that theyre necessarily predisposed to height when all receive what would work best for their particular genetic profile    further ill point out that the expected genetic contribution to variance of 40 is at the low end of what is usually proposed since heredity studies have trouble disentangling the contributions of genetics and upbringing it could be somewhat lower    obviously im biased but i wonder how much has been done to try to falsify these kinds of ideas
  if you could find a viable method for that it would be greatly appreciated by many of us
  my gut  fun fact the gut intestinal tract of humans in comparison to other primates like chimpanzees and gorillas new world primates has developed in to be smaller due to our diet of foods with higher calorie density         great podcast episode with scientist/phsycologist william von hippel to understand more about this
  this will come quite a lot of people are playing with this idea meanwhile i suggest you visualize yourself taller there is anecdotal evidence that it could trigger a little bit of growth
  trust me i visualize daily im hoping for some sort of drug based treatment to come about because i desire not just height but a wider thicker and generally bigger and more robust frame personallyspeaking the circumstances of my birth and early childhood robbed me of what would have been a much larger body which has lead to a lifelong crisis of identity
  just lift weights lol
  it dont work champ see op
  that dude took roids bro
human height difference in first worlders is 90 genetic    so that means that if you are 100mm away from the norm 90mm are due to genetics and 10mm are due to lifestyle     in the third world the genetic component is lower but even then we are talking a couple of inches at most
  roids cant change your frame      citations there arent any because 90 is very very wrong
  no but that guy would look more like the one on the left if he hadnt taken steroids just taller
  you actually can get that big without roiding you have to have a really big frame and respond really well to anabolic efforts though
  how do you deliver the drugs i would think you would have to get a relatively uniform dispersion of them and hit the right layers at the right time so its a little beyond a simple injection
explain this graph then from genetics and educational attainment by david cesarini  peter m visscher
  genetics explains similarities far better than it explains dissimilarities among sufficiently similar individuals its the tolstoy axiom    from the article
  you need hgh before growth plates fuse if youre over 19 you are too old just lift and do sprints youll masculinize your face and skull considerably
  giga brainlet argument in pic related
  genetics plays a bigger role in bmi than intelligence  fat acceptance confirmed our weight is something were born with and we cant modify it
  wrong
    are you the same person this is a seriously advanced kind of cope
  its literally an excerpt from the writeup the dude got the graph from mate
  i dont understand what you mean
sounds like op is the mailmans son heritability of height is the least controversial topic in human genetics studies and human height can be accurately predicted using very basic arithmetic you are making absurd claims without any reason what so ever  whatever it is it is very obvious that you are triggered by this idea of height being heritable but facts are facts
im an inch shorter than my predicted height of 6ft 7 and my mom tells me im the smartest boy in the world  ha haa    suck it
i ate like a starving somalian my whole life because of my computer addiction while my little brother was eating enough for two now hes like 10cm taller im sure genetics played a part but i still regret not doping myself on greek yoghurt meat and doing sport during my developing years
  nothing in science has seemed simple and uncontroversial before someone pointed out a weird discrepancy that blew open the whole notion and exposed much more complex mechanics than wed ever conceived of existing
  weight is equally as heritable as height
  shut the fuck up holy shit
  
  not in this case predictability is very high
go to italy and youll see boat people that are 10cm to 30cm taller than the local south italians italians are supposed to have the healthiest diet and definitely not going hungry    yet some poor africans that grew up on rice and lentils tower over them
  its obscurantist bullshit but i kinda believe it implicit is that environmental interventions that dont account for heritibality are doomed to fail to riff of the eyeglasses example contemporary environmental interventions would assume that the target population is nearsighted due to racism or some nonsense    i do wonder what eyeglasses for iq or height or bmi would mean
  pic is not the whole story    what then should one conclude from data such as those in fig 1 a first conclusion is that most of the observed resemblance between genetically related siblings can ultimately be traced to their genes this observation suggests to us that trying to understand the mechanisms through which genes influences complex outcome such as bmi or performance on a cognitive test may be a worthwhile enterprise a second conclusion is that it should be possible at least in principle to predict a range of scholastic outcomes from genetic data with sufficient information as we argue below such a possibility may prove valuable to many researchers in the coming years    data such as those in fig 1 are sometimes used to justify much stronger conclusions than those we consider appropriate canonical findings from the literature on the heritability of cognitive ability have historically been used to argue for earlier ability tracking and more recently calls for genetically sensitive schools17 most schooling systems eventually separate children into different tracks eg vocational or academic often using past scholastic performance as a major screening device and we suspect the proposition that some sort of screening at some point is desirable which has broad agreement but for the reasons articulated by goldberger and jencks we do not believe any obvious relationship exists between the data pictured in fig 1 and issues such as the optimal timing of ability tracking
  cont     calls for genetically sensitive school are sometimes met by concerns that advances in genomics will be used to justify denying children educational opportunities as opposed to help children better realize their potential all schooling systems already have at least some features that can be characterized as genetically sensitive in the sense that heritable child characteristics such as school grades are used to assign children to the environments children with poor eyesight are hopefully supplied with glasses children with low grades are more likely to be required to retake a grade level children with learning disabilities are sometimes educated by specially trained teachers who rely on different pedagogies and teaching materials eyesight test scores and virtually all learning disabilities have some degree of heritability    ultimately what matters is whether these interventions generate benefits that can justify their costs not whether the bad eyesight or learning disabilities are ultimately caused by genes in our opinion it is only to the extent that genetic information makes it possible to tailor more effective interventions that genetic data may be a useful supplement to systems already in place
  whoa just what the fuck is natural selection and am i a genius
  healthy for longevity  healthy for growth mediterraneans and japanese for that matter eat light      the situations outlined in the op arent wellexplained by the current model
    its saying something that isnt mutually exclusive with what the op is saying that some portion of traits that are are genetic in origin are mediated by environmental conditions that could be changed to some degree it is desirable to tailor those environmental conditions so as to best meet genetic predispositions in such a way that a desired trait is achieved     so many people think traits like height are written in stone at the moment of conception but if you dig deeper than a livestrong article youll find that thoughtful experts disagree maybe we havent figured out everything that causes a child to be tall or not or maybe therere things we could control now that we dont some decades ago we would have assumed that a childs surviving infancy was a matter of their simple genetic fitness it turns out that there are interventions that matter and that the circumstances of birth matter too eg an infant with an olympians genetic heritage born via csection and as a result incurring developmental difficulties vis a vis their gut flora and immune function
  yes but you will never get at the interventions that matter by remaining ignorant of the genetic factors
  i think its a part of the puzzle theres no genetic test for sleep apnea and yet its a disorder that conceivably affects millions of children silently there are probably dozens of factors like this at their heart affecting growth hormone production or something similar probably wealthy parents have the time and energy to notice that something is wrong and the resources to do something about it so in the end the issue isnt genetic or even physiological but socioeconomic if this is the crux of the matter then it explains how nordic countries went from among the shortest to among the tallest in the world the limitation was poverty that was alleviated by wealth and a robust welfare state im not sure what evidence there is that such a paradigm shift only applies to them except some rather backwards and unscientific ethnic biases
   theres no genetic test for sleep apnea    yet     nordic countries used to be among the shortest    source
  yet  why would you run genetic tests for a physiological malady    source  google dutch short and take your pick
  the dutch are not nordic but ok found an article stating it was due to natural selection    
  theyre 67 or 68 at best im 61  their father is 54 and mother is 56   this is not possible mate what likely happened is that the parents decided they dont want short kids so they got a sperm donor or for whatever other reason got a sperm donor or the wife cheated but in the case i doubt theyd still be together
  in case this extreme most probable the guy got cucked or perhaps the parents experienced some sort starvation event during their development however a favourable sorting in which you inherit a good mix of your mothers and fathers plus height genes and less of their minus ones could easily result in a child that is significantly taller than both esp if the child is a boy and the mothers male family members are tall
  this is not possible mate  yes it is
  i meant scandinavian sorry and yes ive seen those it seems about as likely a proposition as those that say that the average height of americans has been affected by immigration ie its an interesting idea but the scale of the change and the numbers purported to support it dont add up      this is not possible mate  the fact that it is possible and that it happens consistently is what is so interesting unless you suppose that every kid thats taller than their parents is the result of a tryst
  im the accused why listen to anything i have to say  how fucked is he
im the accused why listen to anything i have to say    what an amazing selfown ill make sure not to feel bad for him now
  im the accused why listen to anything i have to say  he thinks a paradox will save his ass
his full statement here 
  im kind of aware that im cheering the drowning of the people on the left part of the sinking boat that im also on but fuckin lmao when they get their own people
seems like staged outrage   no way anyone not even the most triggernigger tumblrina could accuse someone of sexual misconduct for a weird handshake and a hug
  for a variety of reasons most justified some unjustified men accused of sexual impropriety in todays metoo climate are presumed to be guilty by the court of public opinion  lol what a cringe lord   theyre lyingbbut uh yes we should believe women most of the time
  for a variety of reasons most justifiedmen accused of sexual impropriety are presumed to be guilty  how is this ever justified he thinks cucking out will save him now well hes wrong
  i was reported to have groped her by searching up her dress when this was simply a search under the covered part of her shoulder of the sleeveless dress  how do you remember the specifics of some nothing shit from 2009 so well
  what kind of science do you think he was doing that required searching up her dress
  same way she did i guess
  meeting a celeb and having them awkwardly touch you is something notable in your life something you tell a lot of people about as a funny story over the years or save up as ammo if youre a cunt   having a slightly awkward meeting with a fan as you do probably ten thousand times a year is not something you remember its something you dont even probably record you do it on autopilot and it should be gone from your memory at the end of the day
  hes not helping himself with this yikes what an autist
  did he have a warrant for that search
  i heard bill nye accidentally say fuck when i was like 13 and i dont go around calling people rapists     seems like nothing but doesnt matter because pussies rule the world and his career is now probably on hold for a few years over this
  native american handshake  awkward and incredibly intimate  this bitch is racist crucify her
for a variety of reasons most justifiedmen accused of sexual impropriety are presumed to be guilty    most justified  presumed guilt  justified    jesus fucking christ i hope hes found guilty even if hes innocent toxic fucking manhating cunt
  if i were to dismiss or deny this womens claims it would be sexist something i am not so i am left only with agreeing with her accusations  jesus how cucked is he
  i cant even tell if hes serious or just making a political statement but is too autistic to not realize how defeatist and guilty this make him look
  defeatist but not guilty at least not to me to the unwashed masses sure
  im the accused why listen to anything i have to say    every time this fuck opens his mouth any brainlet could deliver the perfect response    if not even the accused believe in innocent until proven guilty who will
    yeah im not believing her either most of that comes off as akward naturalist/post modern bullshit on tysons part not enough there to justify sexual harassment allegations
  i believe that he did it you /pol/ brainlet
go back 
  good riddance
  hes right and though id defend myself if i was in his place id also try to draw attention to whats happening the intersex dynamic is being manufactured and manipulated with the ultimate goal being to prevent the masculine and feminine from uniting divide and conquer to keep everyone thinking everyone else is the enemy and the source of their problems and to solidify social apparatuses to conveniently destroy anyone you want whenever you want    how can people not see this its social engineering in progress you really think the homosexual agenda was a coincidence the trans agenda the erosion of any conception of gender whether cultural or biological    this is what they do identify underlying social tensions and groups prop them up promote and overexpress their agendas push for dual purpose changes in society then when youre done with them use these changes to your own benefit this is how you bring a society to its knees and destroy it from the inside    a real classic people have been rendered too distracted and willfully ignorant to see the bigger picture no one can be bothered to give a fuck about anything that isnt fun and trendy to be angry about
  lmfao
  arguably if people are stupid enough to be manipulated this way then they deserve their fate    you gotta be so careful these days pussy in this generation has gotten more expensive than ever
  the problem comes when some genderspecial hired by your kids elementary school decides theyre a tranny and youre abusing them if you dont let them ruin their bodies with tranny stuff
  you gotta be so careful these days  this is the problem youre stuck in the herd and theyll eventually drag you up the ramp with them
    see     she had a meme tattoo of the solar system so ndt being an austronomer tried to look up whether she had pluto tatooed or not
he did literally nothing wrong he should sue these women
  how fucked is he  not as fucked as that woman was when he raped her
he is being ironic and self righteous but in a good way  its absolutely preposterous to suggest that he is an actual rapist and he doesnt need to address it seriously himself  he believes like any good scientist would that a bad hypothesis would prove its bad when applied on the object of contemplation
  lol trying to appease both sides  easy for a nobody to say
         but in its place i offered a handshake and on a few occasions clumsily declared if i hug you i might just want more my intent was to express restrained but genuine affection    imagine denying a hug and then be accused of sexual assault afterwards
      this is you brain under leftism    i hope all this fuckers die by their own sword
  first sexist stephen william hawking next rape by lawrence krauss now rape by neil degrasse tyson  this is getting more and more ridiculous
  three women have accused the cosmos host according to patheos  whats a patheos
  railroad him as hard as they did kavanaugh no justice for people who perpetuate the abolishment of justice hoist him by his petards
he is hella hecked
what was his opinion on the rapist supreme court judge fiasco recently
  kys conspiracy propagandist
  who are you quoting
  whats the matter with pop science and rape
  what was your stance on kavanaugh
  
all he needs to do to make this go away is play the race card black  female on the oppression index how long will it take him to realize this hes played the race card before so hes not above using it a week from now reddit will be full of articles about how his accusers are racists complete with hearsay of how often they say particular racial slurs
  based
  black  female on the oppression index  that may be actually true but sjws put women above everybody feminists rule the sjw world its why hillary was able to play the woman card way more than obama could play the race card
  science man using magical handshake  the story doesnt add up
  obama won hillary lost point remains
  aside from their race/gender obama and hillary were identical candidates with identical campaigns in identical elections  imagine being this retarded
i am no mathematician but i have found the concepts behind vortex math to be useful in daily life thoughts    heres a good reference on the topic  
  holy shit thank you so much for showing me this everything is starting to make sense im starting to realize its all connected now i know that these arent just a coincidence     the sequence 369 appears in mathpi/math infinitely many times   the numbers 3 6 and 9 are equally spaced   if you add 3 repeatedly in base 12 the last digit cycles through 0 3 6 and 9   god has 3 letters christ has 6 letters and el shaddai has 9 letters   the trinity is a union of 3 divine persons and 69 is a symbol of love 369 represents the cosmic orgy of the codivine threefold autofellatio    thank you for sharing this anon i feel like ive found my soul
  thoughts  dumb brainlet shit no different than any other numerology shit  learn real math
  lole
  does the rodin coil actually work or is it pseudo science
entire math department has a 50 fail rate for each class
  on average half the class drops out of your favorite profs courses before end of semester
  by drop do you mean fail or just withdrawal
  having bad taste
  either fail or withdrawl is this normal
  not my fault people cant handle actual rigor
  yes lowlevel 1xxx and 2xxx math classes have a lot of students who arent prepared shouldnt be in their major or shouldnt be in a university at all
  no i mean the upper level math classes have this happening
  wasting your time with a math major at all when you can learn it yourself at your own pace and be very rigorous
  desu the only reason to get a math major is the bragging rights
  literal quitters and babies
  its more common than you think  but not nearly as common as first/second year though
  shitposter posts wojak
  its very typical at schools that dont have massive grade inflation
  so it makes sense to go to a school with grade inflation
  be me  in brazillian public uni  everything has a 50 drop out rate  maths has a 90 drop rate  maths doesnt even have topology or measure theory in the curriculum its basically already babying everyone  they put actual precalculus on the first semester to baby people further but everyone still drops out
  which uni anão
  ufsc
  macaco u
  but they do have topology its optional but they have it  also are you the baby rudin anon from /mg/
  topology  introduction to topology thats basically metric spaces for a semester  topology being optional at all  yeah that was me baby rudin was pretty bad so i swapped for peter d laxs functional analysis substantially better honestly never trusting /sci/ for books again
   math department has a 50 fail rate for each class    question does the world need 1024 weak mathematicians or 8 strong ones    answer 8 strong ones
  are you doing bacharelado or licenciatura i heard the bacharelado professors are total dicks
    if a professor has high fail rates they probably arent a good teacher or they expect too much from their students unfortunate hoop but it doesnt mean you wont pass
  im doing the   steal things from the maths library and solve exercises by myself while studying something else  course
    no it means the students havent been studying in university you are expected to study the material outside of class its not like high school where the teacher spoonfeeds you everything
  kek i just want someone corroborate the professors thing
  i have a friend whos on pam and he tells me hes pretty hyped for having classes with tengan later so they cant be that bad  but hes the sort of autistic friend who knows the whole pam curriculum except the meager functional analysis it teaches but goes to it anyway because itll look good on his curriculum
  i blew my teacher and she still didnt pass me how do i get her to do what i want without threatening her employment
  a lot of students who arent prepared  id say this is the most common and its not prepared as in knowledge wise theres just not any handholding anymore and a lot of students lose track its smoother sailing after the student realizes he is improving himself not being improved upon
  id go with threatening her employment if she wasnt gonna pass you she shouldnt have accepted you blowing her basic decency
  yea ok i just got to enroll first then black mail
  shit and to think its the same country home to impa
  so they cant be that bad  hope so ill be transferring next year
    there are always outliers in terms of classes ability to grasp concepts and pass examinations however if this 50 fail rate is with a sample size of thousands then there is something inherently flawed about this class if this class is too advanced and this is the reason then they need to have more prerequisites to enter if the fail rate is not due to a lack of people who intellectually able to pass then there is either an excessive amount of work that is required for the class that is unreasonable lastly if the professor is horrible at conveying these concepts to his students or is grading unreasonably the professor must be changed    ultimately if over a large scale the average is not a bell curve around a passing average that is consistent with a sufficient understanding what is taught one of these problems is occuring and must be fixed    university may not realize it but they need to get off their high horses sometimes and recognize issues i mean its also for profit so they probably make money from people retaking a class however my points are to be considered in a vacuum
  sodo better than average
  well what do you expect from a shit tier high school system enem is also a big problem since the math section is fucking retarded you dont need to know any math to pass it the hardest question that i remember was literaly basic log properties
  implying you dont need a stable income in order to have the foundation on which to build your selfeducation  you need a job simple as that having a job means less time for yourself and a less rigorous study than whilst being a full time student
  whos gonna pay your study housing etc if youre at that age without having to pay anything you might as well not go to school and learn everything yourself whilst being supported by your parents convincing them to do so now thats the difficult part
take calculus 1  forgot to check teacher reviews figured it would be ok because math  teacher refuses to let us use graphing calculator  have to use some specific third grader calculator that cant even store functions or retrieve what you previously entered  the book assumes you are working with graphing calculates and all example problems are shown solved using the ti84  teacher assigns 40 homework problems from the book and wants to see our work  confront teach on this  i want to really make sure you know the material and are not just entering the problem into the calculator  immediately drop    if you want to make sure we know the material then ask questions that require some actual thinking and cant just be throw into the calculator to be solved you are not teaching us calculus you are forcing us to do hours of pointless algebra that could be done in seconds on a calculator we know fucking algebra we did for 12 fucks years if we didnt know it would be in the easier class designed for retards to pass to fill the math requirementi wanted to learn calculus not review fucking algebra

  mad that he couldnt use a graphing calculator  implying calculus isnt like 90 algebra  are you retarded or a cs major i havent used a calculator in any of my calculus classes because you dont need one it just be almost stupidly easy you could reasonably self teach yourself calculus 1 in maybe 2 or 3 weeks of continuous study if you couldnt do that then i hope your degree doesnt require any mathematics past precal and you just took this class for an elective
  yes i originally posted that but then deleted it due to autotype error calculates instead of calculator  also added in a description of the calculator she tired to make us use     what is the point of posting the inferior version
  i havent used a calculator in any of my calculus classes because you dont need one  but you will later so practice using one now on the easy stuff calculators are tools and this luddite mentality is canceri could wipe out the 40 questions in 1015 minutes with my ti84 just automating stuff like the quadratic equation i dont need to write out the quadratic equation 40 times     you could reasonably self teach yourself calculus 1 in maybe 2 or 3 weeks of continuous study  no shit but i have to take a math class and im paying to take it so i expect to actually learn calculus and not remedial algebra    if you couldnt do that then i hope your degree doesnt require any mathematics past precal  it doesnt i just always liked physics and enjoyed the pre calculus we did in high school i could have taken the piss easy watered down calculus class they offer but if i have to spend months in a classroom i want to get something out of it
teach calculus i  dont give a fuck about my teacher reviews figure its okay because i still have a job  refuse to let students use graphics calculators  the book assumes you are working with a graphing calculator and all example problems are shown solved using the ti84 because its a beginner book for literal brainlets  assign 40 homework problems and want to see the students work to ensure that theyre actually learning  bunch of faggots drop add them to the quitters list we have going around the department  one nerd even likes anime tell the rest of the department to bully him when he takes their class
  having parents  being this spoiled
  go on the science section of an anime website  cry about nobody wanting to take your classes  keep insisting everyone just a brainlet and your special big brained teaching method is to great for them to handle
return to uni after 5 years  take calc 3 exam nothing in class uses calculator and i remember not being allowed to use them in calc 1/2  mfw every1 has a ti84 for test  get an a 46 fail rate what  next test cram every trig identity/integral/derivative identity/mclaurin series patterns on the ti84 prgm thing  get a b

class is going fine  last two weeks the professor realizes the term is almost up so he bombards us with as much new material we covered in the last 6 weeks while barely explaining anything and writing on the board with inconsistent notation  only one set of office hours left  dont understand anything  final is worse 60 of the grade    welp an all too familiar story where my grade gets annihilated at the end
  final is worth 60 of grade  do they actually do this
  is that a lot or not in my uni exams were worth about 70 of our overall grade and there was one exam for each course and they were all within onetwo weeks of each other in spring    the rest of the overall mark was usually labs and projects and smaller units which mostly werent tied to any specific course directly so essentially the grade for each individual course was 100 exam
  rudin is a meme
  its always at least 50 i hate it since its usually barely cumulative its annoying to have my grade matter so much on the material we learned at the very end and often times didnt even have homework on
not wanting to get selected from the normies  i dont know whats the problem about that
  for real deciding between cs or mathself teach cs and am truly confused everyones saying different things
  dudei dont even give a single fuck about mathi just need those classes so i can be a webdev brainletwhy is math even forced on mewhy do i need to complex numbers and function analysis and shit just to be a webdev
  impa
  i swapped out baby rudin for laxs functional analysis  are you okay those books are not anywhere close to covering the same material swap out rudin for phue at least
  prof runs out of time doesnt even mention anything at all about the final chapter of the course in lectures  says nothing about this when outlining exam to class  half the final is this chapter  for people who studied up to where the lectures stopped it was just _barely_ possible to even pass that test if they did everything they knew perfectly  i squeaked through because i had seen some chunks of the material before but anyone who hadnt was fucked
  pure math  something else and self teach cs
  i think they want to get good grades in their other classes and possibly have time to socialize and work and relax
  aight basically i didnt know at the time that baby rudin was only rudins principles of analysis i thought it was an affectionate name for rudin  i was reading his functional analysis
  engineering department has 70 fail rate
math department here had over 90 failure last semester
  
  yeah autists here like to sperg out with even worse names like papa and grandpa rudin and you are right for avoiding those two lax is definitely superior there his principles book is quite good though
  i could have taken the easy calculus class  implying that is not what this is right here  yes
  using the quadratic formula  you guys arent taught sum and product
  its not 2019 yet though
  mobile wikipedia  unironically kill youre self
  i dont understand why professors have to be so bad teaching math
  after running tutorial sessions in a thermodynamics course i have to say thats a good thing most of these people should fail
  its all a scam they want people to fail its what divides the lower class from the higher class shaping society into what it is nowcomplete shit
  well first of all they do not need a teaching credential or it equivalent only a postdoc position which half of the people in such a position are entirely unwilling to give people any clue about what the course is about
  yeah bro if the bars too high lower the bar who needs a challenge amirite    low quality schools  low quality jobs    insert reply about how your school sucks and youre content with your job   it could have been better

a drug to be administered as single tablets two times every 24 hours    how would you interpret thiswhat would you think is the time interval supposed to be between taking the drugsshould you take one and then the other one 24hrs later or take one and the other one 12hrs later thanks
1 tablet at 8 am  1 tablet at 8pm    how can you have such low verbal iq
  i would say 2x tablets every 24 h
  but if you take another tablet again then it would be at 8am so that would be 3tablets in 24hrs i know the tablet wouldnt be immediately effective but its still 3tablets in 24hrs poorly worded question
  wrong 8 to 8 is 12 hours   take two whole tablets at some point every 24 hours this isnt hard  take one at 8pm  12 hours pass  take one at 8am  12 hours pass  take one at 8pm 24 hours elapsed now
what would be the end products of potassium ferrocyanide electrolysis using carbon electrodes    could you liberate cyanide gas from the solution like that    iron electrodes in this scenario yield hydrogen and prussian blue so i was wondering what products would one get in this case
  im in my second year of studying chemistry and while i do not know for sure i have a hunch that electrolysis of potassium ferrocyanide in an acidic solution could yield hcn gas along with some other gasses correct me if im being a brainlet though
    do you know which changes would occur in a neutral solution
i dont know if im posting in the right board but here goes    do you have any recomendations such as books or youtube channels to study    1 advanced calculus  2 circuit analysis  3 programing just starting    thanks
1 advanced calculus
      
  mit ocw  thats a great youtube channel to learn about calculus circuit analysis and programming d
read the fucking sticky
  most people suggest that rudin is great for analysis and thus calculus i dont recommend because the problems in his book are rather too standard i recommend you to read real mathematical analysis by charles pugh he has unbelievably incredible problems     for circuit analysis this is a good textbookwebsite      for programming maybe learncppcom   the best book would be structure and interpretation of computer programs
why do we move forward in time
  stan wills it
  we dont move forward in time everything moves forwards this is tantamount to asking why do peoples velocities accelerate while theyre sitting in cars/boats/planes/trains that accelerate     to answer the better question why does everything move forwards in time time is the measure by which we view the progression of events as three dimensional biological beings everything moves forwards because our instinct programs our minds to order in pastpast possibilitiespresentfuture possibilitiesfuture fashion the future follows from the present the present follows from the past and the future will become the past   in order to see time as something that does not move youd require something detached from our programming this could be programmed by us theoretically but thats unlikely
  there is no such thing as forward anon
because we experience and describe it as such its entirely arbitrary
  but not so arbitrary it cant be put into an equation
  no matter which way time went we would experience that flow as forward that being said time does not flow in reality we experience changes in time because our very processes of consciousness require cause and effect chains to exist
  if we moved backwards wed call that forward
  larger areas in configuration space are more likely to be reached by random perturbations to a system the measure of area is called entropy so systems develop towards higher entropy this gives a direction in configuration space this direction is where time is flowing
  because of bayes rule and the resulting asymmetry of information about the past and future laws of physics are mostly timereversal symmetric states of knowledge about systems are not     
second law of thermodynamics entropy always increases this progression is the physical definition of time
  why do we move forward in time  because we define forward as the direction in which we are moving
    low iq  then why do we progress relative to an initial time

i found my granddads altimeter pic related and it says that the pressure is basically sea level but im at 350m above sea level     i calculated that it should say that its around 980 mbar   is it broke or what
check with the nearest meteorological station your hs physics calculation is probably not accurate
  they do need periodic calibration
  implying i did the nerd calculation shit   google did it for me lad
  oh really   i had no idea   my granddads been dead for like 30 years or someshit this hasnt been touched since then  will it work after it gets calibrated
    30   mistyped   meant 20
please respond lads
      goggle is your friend
  or google and yes it should work
  but i cant find anything about analogue altimeters
  bitch its been like ten minutes chill out go do something else while you wait
  add calibration to the string  sigh  millennials
  altimeters like that are whats called a manometer  it has a tube inside that is bent in a spiral and twists according to the outside pressure it is a purely mechanical metering method and the manometer tube gets tired after some time and gives false readings i have an old one for vacuum that still works but reads extra pressure without a connection

18 yo senior no ban pls    im taking ap calculus ab shit school doesnt offer bc and holy shit my teacher is slow    the last time we took notes was on 11/13 and weve been doing optimization for a week and a half we just started related rates which is easy as fuck    i really fucking like math but the pace of the class is just too slow for me personally im pretty much like pic related because i understood what was being taught in 5 minutes while half the class takes 3 days to fully get it     its just getting frustrating so /sci/ what is the best online resource for calc 1  2    ive heard of khan academy albertio edx and udemy but let me know what sites you recommend
if the pace is too slow for you cant you just finish the textbook before everyone else
  this unless you dislike reading
  if you dont learn this in highschool then it will only slow you down in college get yourself a nice textbook and teach yourself material online resources should be used as backups see the sci wiki for a list
  self study for the bc exam
  rudins real and complex analysis
  your uni proffs will be even more shit and possibly speaking broken english get used to it
  however if you care more about being able to compute integrals and differential equations then read algorithms of computer algebra to learn rischs integration algorithm and read on automatic differentiation is pretty easy
  ap calculus  thats impressive anon i failed algebra three times cause i couldnt understand that variables can be moved from one side to the other i just tried to find x by guessing arithmetically and see how close i got
  rudins real and complex analysis  rudin is a meme
  im also a senior in a similar situation were still on limits
    read the textbooks and do the exercises
4/5 of a billion mcbucks  not a single damn camera dedicated to filming landing/taking shitty small sized jpegs for timelapse of landing  not a single god damned flap to pop the camera out of upon landing so you dont have this single shit smeared image to present to the public  literally a billion mcdollarmenus to send this thing to mars to put a thermometer a couple feet underground expecting to learn a single damn thing about the martian core than couldnt already be figured out from far better orbital mechanics/sediment/gravity/ad infinitum data just like on earth    why
its also our first good martian seismograph and the biggest power station on mars right now
thinking a thermometer a couple feet underground will tell you anything at all about the core that is in anyway admissible     this is the stupidest thing nasa has ever done bar none
tfw no retarded touchdown dance to perform with some room temp digit iq single mother retard when our billion dollar money laundering tax bullshitoprobe sits its fat ass down on a chunk of soace dust to do nothing at all
  mobile seismograph on a fucking goldcart rc car with suspension and shit blasting it 247     worth every 1bill of those mcbucks i find it insulting that nasa is supposed to be for the people and they cant even take some shitty jpegs of the landing for some kid to see and be happy about never mind the literal retardation of planning and expectations of dats using the swiss army knife set on an rc car they sent       absurd everyone has gone mad
  just put the thermometer on a stick and just shove it in the fucking mud and tell them its going to tell us the core temperature
  chaching
took half a century of effort to put a single seismograph on mars  honestly it is no wonder a lot of people rightfully think spaceflight is a waste at this rate just the earthmoon system has enough material to sustain space science with steady funding for new research until the end of the universe
  well good thing you can opt out of paying into these missions oh wait
  
  the celebration sex after that must be insane tfw never experiencing it
  they literally think that mars is like a thanksgiving turkey and if you simply go underneath the surface at all boom instant data feed to the core heat    i could write a book about why that is asinine but what would that matter they will do what they do regardless maybe 50 years from now we will know something new and not just be treated like mushrooms feed them shit and keep them in the dark
  id unironically rather fuck the guy in the fedora air humping in the background than that disgusting fat braphog of a cunt
  
  seismograph  on a literal gokart terrain buggy    bbut itll work somehow they can just stop and be really still    no that is not how you get meaningfuk data from a seismograph that is toptier jpl pleasd fund me we have go pro gimbals n sheeeit that wont last at all and still be nowhere near good enough for anything fucking meaningful
  really like really really i mean im not trying to white knight here but i see her and i she just seems so cute imagine what that girl must be like naked all white and nice all soft skin and all imagine how nice it would be to embrace her shes got kindof a redhead vibe her soft skin pressed against all of your body her lips slowly pressing in slow kisses against your chest watching a movie together caressing her its the real fucking deal i mean imagine sucking her tits her small perky tits caressing her hips taking her on all fours discussing astronomical concepts as pillow talks would that not be heaven am i crazy
    now that i look at it it seems like fedora guy bald guy and small chick are going to engage in a rageful free for all thresome after all its said and done
  pretty sure youre trolling and i was partially too i wouldnt fuck a fedoralord but i also have standards and a frumpy out of shape girl with a fupa and acts like a dumbass isnt my cup of tea but then again im not a thirsty ass betaboy like you who has zero self respect and will take what he can get i go to the gym i stay in shape i have never been overweight etc also nothing about her looks perky she looks like an typical armchair tech support chubby guy again the fupa is present you are the reason why women today can get away with murder    cheers
  im all of what you say stay in shape hit the gym etc i bet you must be below 12 bf to even dare to talk to me like that but ill bite and i still find her atractive but hey maybe its a matter of taste      you are the reason why women today can get away with murder    i dont get this why am i the reason of anyhting i know how to apreciate women even the traditionally hot ones that go on the magazines but also the exotic ones or the ones that dont get cover by mainstream media but are still in my opinion quite atractive but hey its a free country if you like it bone it if you dont hten shut up whatever you do dont accuse me of being the fault of why some hot women didnt want to go to bed with you hint it might have something to do with your resentful personality but hey like i said its a free country cheers right back at cha mate
   a single damn camera dedicated to filming landing/taking shitty small sized jpegs for timelapse of landing  because you wouldnt have been able to see shit through the retro rocket plumes   a single god damned flap to pop the camera out of upon landing so you dont have this single shit smeared image to present to the public  its called a dust cover the thing that was in front of the camera at the time that picture was taken and removed shortly afterward after the dust had time to settle   to learn a single damn thing about the martian core than couldnt already be figured out from far better orbital mechanics/sediment/gravity/ad infinitum data  implying you know anything about what you just said     a literal gokart terrain buggy  its not a fucking rover
  i forgot to quote 
the insight lander drill will go 5 meters into the martian surface just because they didnt put cameras on it so there would be pretty pictures doesnt mean it is worthless from a scientific standpoint
  yeah but bitching about women and nass us too much fun
  hmmm  if it crashed how would they put the data together for an after action report to know what went wrong
  theyre placing the seismograph on the martian soil and this lander is not a rover it just sits there and has no wheels and no mobility
  ok so youre saying that because of the final 3 seconds of the landing when the retros fire and dust is everywhere that because of this fuck all the amazing aerial shots on the way down on approach to planet after entry and before retros man you are really far up nasas ass defending that one    also literally prove him wrong about learning anything about the damn core temp by sticking a thermo under a pile of dust on the ground cause thats essentially all youre doing dont tell me drilling a couple feet will change anything you really lack iq      mobile seismo deployed on a rocket crash landing on a rock and through the power of programming and the teams who brought you the 300kg probe fuckup due to them not knowing whether to use metric or imperial will just werk     well i assume there will be tons of fucking noise to comb through and make sense of it
  not a single god damned flap to pop the camera out of upon landing so you dont have this single shit smeared image to present to the public  just take off the lense cap and take another
  exactly but dont you worry theyll do whatever they want in their own time funding will never be an issue you see
  they are not paid to instantly entertain the public
  everyone and i mean everyone who is smart and works in geoscience or geology knows the turkey dinner thermo idea is laughable at best downright inexcusable at worst    they will get plenty of readings from it but thats the nature of a thermometer after all but it wont tell you a damn thing about the core temps at that depth are more influenced by the sun/weather/local crust composition/thickness/voids etc    really is just amazing to think they can essentially do whatever they want regardless of it being useful people love seeing their random noise in data afterall just look at cern
  i agree entertainment isnt necessary but thats not what were asking for were asking for puctures of the planet they landed on before during and after lol you bootlicker we paid for it
  travel months through space to another planet  not take a few pics on approach or when descending    dont give me your bullshit about this being ok anyone would want these pics if you dont youre lying
we could have done better with those billions of dollars  privatise nasa its a money sink  let the rich piss away their money on it
a scientist subject to no peer review is no longer practicing science    in this case nasa with a unlimited funding in the pipeline and blocks all comments on the actual site and any release is that scientist
  ok so youre saying that because of the final 3 seconds of the landing when the retros fire and dust is everywhere that because of this fuck all the amazing aerial shots on the way down on approach to planet after entry and before retros man you are really far up nasas ass defending that one  well yeah because before the retro rockets it has a fucking heatshield on it so that it doesnt burn up on atmospheric entry    also literally prove him wrong about learning anything about the damn core temp by sticking a thermo under a pile of dust on the ground cause thats essentially all youre doing dont tell me drilling a couple feet will change anything you really lack iq  temperature differential it works to a degree on earth as well but theyll be extrapolating quite a lot thing is that mars is so cold so fucking cold that if its any warmer under ground thats pretty much evidence that the core is active
  mars is so cold so fucking cold that if its any warmer under ground thats pretty much evidence that the core is active
/pol/tards say give more funding to nasa
  well yeah because before the retro rockets it has a fucking heatshield on it so that it doesnt burn up on atmospheric entry    you simply dont read i said pictures on approach before entry not from a sat 16mil miles away after entry and before landing its not rocket science in this case of rocket scientistry
  pol is retarded about lots of things especially newpol its all bots but thats not terribly on topic right now
  i said pictures on approach before entry  cocooned  after entry  still cocooned  and before landing  retrorockets
  descent imaging has been possible for decades and just as possible for this mission as well do you even know what youre talking about
  theyre literally mapping the planet as we speak
   that has nothing to do with not taking pictures of the descent onto a planet 2months away in the solar system so far this thing is only a billion dollar turkey thermometer that has one image of the surface half obstructed by the lander and not even raw
nasa is a joke slash their funding and give it to spacex then we can get a guy on mars in a few years and do 200 years worth of garbage probe experiments in 10 minutes with a shovel and camera
  spacex  lol
  nasa is a joke  correct  and give it to spacex    here where you lost me first of all elon is already on the dole in the form of grants second of all the citizens should never be forced to pay a space exploration tax that is beyond ridiculous i myself would contribute to space exploration but i wouldnt expect or force my neighbors to do so as well    space exploration isnt exempt from the laws guiding every other single endeavor/industry which is supply/demand and risk/reward    columbus didnt sail the seas because the impoverished people of spain were desperate to have their labor go to something they will never benefit from in their lifetime he sailed the seas because the monarchy saw profit for themselves    if people want to go to mars they will and people can purchase stock in spacex if they want stop making people pay for things without asking them thanks
  and
  and youre changing the subject was all i was pointing out and now youre just saying and like a dumbass
  he sailed the seas because the monarchy saw profit for themselves    sorry is that the same monarchy that acquired their riches through taxation and used that to fund colonial ventures
  yes the same one that held the people under strict oppression and servitude and implemented such fan favorites as the inquisition good times    just because you want something doesnt mean you get to tell everyone else they like it too i like space i like exploration but i also like the constitution and agree with the reasons behind its formation
  they should be thinking about doing that since it makes the average retards and kids interested
  not even close    
  stop making people pay for things without asking them thanks    but this is exactly what countries do with 90 of tax money
  now youre activiting those almonds good
  why we already have lots of pictures you want to see more sand
  youre the one who is clearly the dumbass with no idea about the technological capabilities on board the lander and the sorts of limitations they have to deal with  what are you even so butthurt about
  okay this is epic   we want a refund nasa
  childrens voice  no youre a dumbassss    easy on the iq sir lets keep it above room temp
  the mission requires that insight land in one of the most boring flattest parts of mars theres not much to fucking see no you can figure shit like that out from orbital mechanics alone      then write a book faggot tell us all why you think you know more than some of the worlds best geologists    they developed a special robotic arm to put it on the surface of mars so that the seismograph is decoupled from the wind noise produced by the lander which was the problem with the viking seismograph
  whoops forgot my pic
obscure chinese beef slicing board  has the best geologists in the world     you guys should apply to work at nasa
itt luddites
    convincing arguments whats wrong cant refute anything said ad hominem and changing the subject is easier i suppose
  nasa  unlimited funding  it aint the 60s anymore gramps nasa is one of the least funded federal groups
  contrarian retard
  explain to me how stating a fact is contrarian
  meaning yes retard nothing in humans terms is unlimited except for stupidity unlimited was being used as a figure of speech in terms of funding because they just get more in their coffers each day no matter what    then you the contrarian retard shows up and says the first thing that comes to mind so that he may be right about something anything even if it really is just stupid as fuck and literally not anything people dont understand already    thats how
   of a billion mcbucks    youre probably one of those dipshits that use 8ths and 32nds
  i have a different question i have seen many rovers on mars going around and none of them ever have dust on them i used to ask people how do these rovers stay so clean and they would tell me that it is because there is no moisture so the dust does not stick and just falls off  so how the fuck is mud sticking to the windshield of this module when it doesnt stick to the rovers
  no
    fucking this you stupid god damn retard
  i believe its from the landing rockets not the dust it looks very similar to spacex cameras during / after booster landings
  probably shits burned into them
    im used to driving in dirt and mud and snow and thats what my windshield often looks like though to me it looks like the thrusters kicked dirt into the air and it stuck onto the windshield but from every other example dust can only accumulate on horizontal plane because it will slide off from gravity otherwise so that has to be wet dirt where the thing landed and started drilling a hole
  dude just cause a similar looking thing happens when you drive in mud doesnt make this mud anyway that picture was taken right after landing no drilling yet i dont even think theyve started drilling as of this post
  well it cost a billion mcbucks but look at that weird metal artifact at bottom center pretty clear resolution too
  i can prove that mud creates that affect can you prove that thrusters can do the same without obscuring the whole windshield
  if it was heat it would create a bloom pattern of obfuscation which increased with more time/heat until it was full obscured not splashed dirt
  im aware they hadnt started drilling in this picture im claiming that when it landed the force of doing so with thrusters lifted some dirt into the air obscuring that windshield and that for that to happen it means theres moisture in the ground where they are about to dig
  yes but again my argument is that it is from the landing rockets why do you want to disagree with this when you yourself have asserted that the dry martian dust doesnt cling to surfaces  i can promise you there is no moisture in the top level of martian dust the incredibly thin atmosphere would cause it to evaporate instantly
  its from hot dirt being thrown up by very hot exhaust gasses burning into or scorching the lens cover it looks exactly like the protective cover on my welding goggles
if you check several pics you can see the mud droplets moving and vaporizing definitely something mixed in
50 social credit points has been added to your citizen score     sounds a bunch of ass mad changs in here
  stop being obtuse or are you one of those people that thinks this gif is accurate and a footlong potroast thermo just needs to get closer to the molten core 20 feet under the surface of mars in a big hot lord of the rings lake    notice how nasa is pretty much already convinced themselves of this bog molten core kinda makes you wonder
  that gif  that fucking slogan
  notice how nasa is pretty much already convinced themselves of this bog molten core kinda makes you wonder    an interesting point that actually does make me wonder in a non meme kind of way they seem quite sure if themselves knowing so little then they send this turkey baster that wont do anything to apparently confirm what they already know
  presumably it should give them more information about what they suspect to be the case    what do we know about the thermometer
  what do we know about the thermometer    we know that it is probably capable of measuring temperature to an accurate degree of the local areas ground that is being influenced by the sunlocal rock compand local density of ground/proximity to warmer/colder ground areas we know this was a cool billion at the lowly taxpayers expense thats what we know what we dont know is if they included a drill to bore another hundred/thousand or so miles down to get any information about the core temp that is without a doubt due to a hot core
  probably meant to interest your everyday retard who has heard about planetary cores but not fully internalized the concept
  are you aware atmospheric reentry generates mach numbers above 10 and therefore temperatures in the thousands of kelvin range that thing had to be wrapped in a massive heat shield a tiny tiny crack in the heat shield led to a space shuttle being lost imagine what would happen to a fucking camera lens pointless to take a risk like that
it is the entire thought process behind these probes that is fucked up    hurr durr lets send a single probe to mars for  billions    that money should have paid for an entire manufacturing line to dot the planet with rovers
  go on explain how a n billion would litter the planet with more than a few rovers

  the truth about the earth
  this better be bait
do numbers exist
  yes heres a photo
  no they are concepts
  do dollars exist
  no but their magnitudes does numbers are just representations
  concepts exist
  your question is far too ambiguous to understand what you mean     define numbers and define exist
  numbers are actually just one concept prove me wrong
mfw
  define define
in the only scope in which your question even means anything ye
  i think so
  not him but  something would be defined as in being the mathematical definition of itself    now what
  /thread
  nicely put    but id correct it to their relational magnitude    their absolute or individual magnitude does not exist imo
  so 1 apple could really just be 2 its all relative
    can you flesh this out for me im african studies major
  to provide sufficient and necessary conditions so a name can be assigned to a concept    now define logically existence
    1 on relational magnitude i like to think of it being proportion      the thing thats named apple is relative thats a problem with language though not mathematics people say a pair of pants even though its one object but is an apple even one object it has trillions of atoms after all    but thats not what matters what matters is that the rules of math still work i dont care if you call 1 apple as 2 apples if i have 2 apples and you give me 4 apples then i sure as shit better have 6 apples what 6 apples means in reality is relative to whatever the speaker believes an apple is
  they exist as abstract concepts and though they are not physically real they describe phenomenons that are true in our physical material universe
  this is about maths in general
  our monkey brains are pretty good at two things that relate to math space and logic/grammar from these we can figure out where numbers come from and what they really are    what most people call numbers is really just a game of logic on symbols if i asked you to compute 248852 would you really imagine adding quantities of those numbers together no youd use the rules/logic of arithmetic to manipulate the symbols to get the answer the symbols themselves dont matter what matters is that the rules are consistent and work to solve a problem the numbers themselves are really mathematical objects along with things like quaternions and all sorts of stuff in group theory most numbers as used by mathematicians are just abstract objects to be manipulated by logic    but numbers do relate to something in reality space the integers are like the space of a number line you can imagine addition and multiplications that transform this space and you can probably relate these transformations to things that appear in your real daily life but those real life imaginations of how things move or take up space are generally just proportions sure you may be able to count less than 10 objects easily but beyond that you enter the world of proportions    imagine i give you a jar of 1000 jelly beans but i dont tell you how many are in there then i give you a jar of 2000 jelly beans and again dont tell you how many there are i highly doubt youll be able to count how many jelly beans there really are but youll probably easily be able to say that the second jar has about twice as many jelly beans its all spacial intuition    look at history many cultures never developed numbers even if they had words small quantities even in the west arabic numerals didnt become mainstream until the 15th century many early mathematicians instead just worked with a compass and straightedge which surprise is all about exploring space and proportion    hth
  you are relating 1 apple to 2 apples    1 apple alone has no magnitude if you cant compare it to a multitude of apples
could humanity save themselves in this scenario you think is this the right board    new studies come out today that say that the suns energy output is lowering drastically and it will have an impact on our life within 2000 years  despite the controversy other studies can confirm it  more accurate technology not only confirms this but actually predicts that the sun will be outputting 50 of the current energy and light within 400 years  the sun will almost definitely fizzle out within 10002000 years  there isnt a widespread panic but people are understandably worried  the temperature drop is noticeable over the decades and centuries    you think humanity could/would do something about it possible developments/strategies ideas on how governments etc would react    this is a what if scenario so im not sure if it fits the board but id be interested in a more scientific perspective to this thought exercise
  oh yeah important to the consistency of the scenario  nobody knows the reason why the sun is cooling down and its never discovered
  sincerely this shit could save us from global warming and buy us time to deal with it
  i mean pretty much the opposite of it is happening and nobody cares
it wont affect any of us so who cares  inb4 any green text
  heh heh hehhhhhl no
  think theyd be more apt to in a situation where denial of the pending disaster doesnt help maintain profits    in this case if theres anything to be done itd likely be a government scale project and various corps would be lining up at the door for those sweet sweet gumbmint bux thus theyd be more apt to spread info making the problem seem more urgent than it is rather than trying to deny its existence because theyd have to do things thatd cut into their profits and give rise to competing industries to fix the problem    granted the average citizen still might not pay it too much attention as theres simply nothing they can do but theyd be less apt to be coopted into denying the situation by political interests as thered be no real motive for said interests to push for that
  thats one of the outcomes i can see happening  gubermints dont give a shit because none of them will be alive when the effects of global warming kick in
  nobody knows the reason why the sun is cooling down and its never discovered  well then by this scenario obviously no nuttin you can do at that point    i mean maybe you can start setting up some space colonies in other solar systems and a thousand years might be enough time to pull that off but if that sun gonna go out no matter what theres not enough energy in the remainder of the solar system to make it sustainable in the long term theres also nothing to say all the other stars might start going out for the same mysterious reason    otherwise simpsons did it  
  theres always a small portion of the populous that thinks big picture and more than a generation ahead question is whether they have enough clout to get the rest of the populous on board with any potential solutions they may think up    but that portion of the population is why civilization exists to begin with so generally at least they have enough sway to get some shit done where those who start it arent gonna live long enough to see the results internet national highway systems cathedrals agricultural planning etc
  hm what about enmasse research and development of solar and nuclear power  store shittons of solar energy force drastic power consumption reductions exploit geothermal and nuclear energy for the rest of the time    i imagine that in a few centuries we could either develop nuclear to the point where we could last enough to migrate to another star or something
  every 11 years this same retarded meme  kys
  so global warming is no longer an issue
  well with a thousand years to blow and motive to rush it yeah we probably could get interstellar colonies going but sustaining life here in the long term wouldnt be doable at least certainly not with these numbers  maybe you could keep could use a combination of nuclear and geothermal and genetic engineering and a whole lotta hydroponics to keep a few million alive below the surface for a few thousand years maybe even tens of thousands but nothing like the population of near seven billion people were looking at now    and its not as if youre going to save many if any of those seven plus billion lives with the space colonies which would likely be seeder colonies perhaps catered to by a handful of live passengers theyd give mankind the chance to blossom again elsewhere but they would only be the hopes and dreams of the old civilization not the population itself even with a thousand years i doubt we could build sustainable interstellar mass exodus ships maybe if some of those kugelblitz ideas can be made to work but seems doubtful    and again if you dont know what made this star burn out when all science says it should be doing the opposite whos to say the other stars arent in the same boat
  even with a thousand years i doubt we could build sustainable interstellar mass exodus ships  66 years from first flight to moon landing say otherwise
  theres quite a bit of difference between sending a handful of guys in tin cans with a rocket attached to the moon a few times and essentially manufacturing self contained worlds capable of making the billions of times longer journey between the stars    theres quite a bit of debate as to whether such a thing is even physically possible the only hypothetical tools we currently have to do such a thing are highly theoretical and involve space born infrastructure on a scale weve hardly dreamt of before just to begin building the power sources  nevermind the ships themselves    and once that star does go out youre done  not enough power around to start the project    so yeah embryo ships or tiny seeder colonies those at least are within our grasp but mass exodus ships involves things that may turn out simply arent possible
  could we develop technology to survive yes it would just be a far easier version of building a colony on another planet nuclear power maybe even fusion could provide much of what we need in our dome or cave cities   the politics however might not work out well
is bootes void proof of existence type iii civilization
no we would see infrared light even if they had covered every star with a dyson sphere/swarm the thing about a dyson sphere is that it has to emit as much energy as it collects from the star inside it otherwise it will continue to heat up until it starts to visibly glow anyway this means by looking for longer wavelengths we would be able to see any hidden stars in the bootes void however we see nothing    also the blocking of star light would not prevent any gas and dust clouds from blocking light from behind the void and that does not happen the void is a region of space very empty of normal matter and dark matter
    isnt the bootes void galaxy supercluster sized
    also why is the image search from op getting the barnard68 dark cloud result
  voids are expected under the current model  bootes is no where near the biggest  our milky way is inside one
i dont see how it proves a type 3 civilization that void is huge and so weird there is stuff everywhere why is there a void many light years across
  how can you know what technology such a civilization would have  if they could harness clusters of galaxies im certain they could contain every last bit of energy
  the thing about a dyson sphere is that it has to emit as much energy as it collects from the star inside it  are you retarded what would be the point of a dyson sphere if it just emitted all the energy it collected
  
  like a dam  all the water it collects must at some point move along
  the thing about a dyson sphere is that its fucking retarded sci fi bullshit
  is this what the rest of the universe looks like galaxies and stars everywhere
  
  man it sure would suck to live in one of the galaxies in that void youd never get anywhere itd be like living in the rural us without a car
  theyre strange galaxies too rolled up like a tube
that isnt bootes void its a molecular cloud called barnard 68 inside our own galaxy it isnt empty either theres 60 galaxies in it
  inside our own galaxy   60 galaxies in it
  yo dawg we heard you like galaxies
  why
  it is a proof of big foot
  you couldnt keep it centered over time
  wtf why not
  because what keeps the planets in orbit is that they pull on the sun and the sun pulls back if you have a complete ring around your planet then its trying to pull in every direction equally one push in any direction and then one side pulls more than the other and eventually your star crashes through the side of your dyson sphere   image youre on a merry go round at a playground and its spinning really fast and youre standing in the exact center of it as long as you stay dead still everything will be fine wobble too much and you get flung outward   you either need thrusters that can move the mass of the inner planets and a super structure that can hold up to the stress or scifi tier antigravity you can get around it by breaking up the sphere into smaller pieces
  i dont imagine the dyson sphere as a single object but rather a vast array of objects i really dont think a problem arises here
  thats literally the distinction between a dyson swarm and a dyson sphere
really makes you think    these guys are just now witnessing the birth of the universe
  proof    mysteries are not proof of anything  nobody knows how x works therefore y does it     mysteries are just that mysteries the furthest thing from a proof is a mystery
    god we are so lucky    i bet a type iii is plowing their way to type iv and were last in line
  maybe theyre leaving galaxies that have noteworthy life
  install gentoo
  can we stop posting this fucking shit please    1 its not bootes void  2 its not a void
  this
  thats entropy for you
  or a type 4  5
  any advanced civ would want to camoflage its presence instead of a void wed see utterly mundane normal space
  hoags object    a nearly perfect ring of young hot blue stars circles the older yellow nucleus of this ring galaxy c 600 million lightyears away in the constellation serpens
  why nobody can hide in space  please dont spread dark forest theory nonsense
  dark forest theory nonsense  its the only model and evidence we have for contact between civilizations if you think it could turn out otherwise what are you basing this on
  what exactly is it anon
  this if were just positing sci fi magic maybe they convert it to different dimensional matter maybe a dyson sphere convert objective energy into subjective and its a giant mind its all totally in the air
  nonsense it would stay tethered to all the gravitational forces around beyond that if we can keep satellites in orbit some future world can do that
  i want /x/ to leave this board
  something massive in the way that inhibits our view
  its the only model and evidence we have for contact between civilizations   on a planet plus civilizations like japan or thailand werent destroyed by contact with others  unlike a continent a planetary life is perfectly visible since it starts by telescopes there is zero chance of hiding
  does it have a name
  on a planet plus civilizations like japan or thailand werent destroyed by contact with others  neither of those were isolated and in any case plenty of postcolonial thinkers would tell you they were destroyed or at least badly affected by western interference
  dark forest is stupid because any sufficiently advanced civilization would have long outgrown conflict otherwise they wouldnt be sufficiently advanced
  or they got really really good at conflict
  bane
  what a retarded opinion    all known life loves to wreck and kill things
  earths biosphere is perfectly visible to any advanced civilization with telescopes since billions of years  theres no point in hiding
  the thing about a dyson sphere is that it has to emit as much energy as it collects from the star inside it    im glad you are an expert on alien technology millions of years more advanced than ours
  just physics m8
  at the moment yes and well get instantly squashed by any aggressive aliens who spot us the minute we get the technology to hide we should and probably will
  thats not going to chanfe anything light from our planet already was emitted and any civilization observing universe would knew about our existence
  literally every process involving work being done releases waste heat anon
  correct but its also the only reason some people think voids are caused by super civilizations because the stars would be blocked out
  one push in any direction and then one side pulls more than the other    actually spherical structures around gravitational sources are stable the real problem with a true dyson sphere is that no material is strong enough to hold itself up against the suns gravity even at large distances rather than thinking of a dyson sphere failing because on side fell into the sun which wouldnt happen think of a dyson sphere failing because gravity starts crushing it down in all directions at once     a dyson swarm gets around this by catching the stars light with billions of independently orbiting objects    a true dyson sphere in principal could be held up by the same mechanism that holds up an orbital ring superstucture but orbital rings are also stupid bullshit that will never work in real life
  that description    having access to a lot of energy does not enable one to change fundamental laws of the universe it also does not allow you to live inside black holes or do any of that shit having a lot of energy literally just means being able to move bigger chunks of matter around at higher speeds
   thing about hydroelectric dams is that you have to let the water flow out to generate electricity  but how can you say aliens with really thin phones couldnt generate power just by holding the water back anon    you are this retarded
  void distances dont matter if you have intergalactic travel technology a race from the denser smart if the universe could visit our galaxy anytime they felt it and probably have mapped out every single star in our void
  implying they havent just swallowed entire stars as a fuel source  first off the kardashev scale is retarded because it only takes into account forms of energy we are familiar with a civilization with the resources to build a dyson sphere could have stumbled upon a much more valuabe source of energy that negated the need for such a structurezero point vacuum energy hawking radiation from a contained kugelblitz etc secondly a type iii civilization would find dyson spheres/swarms as antiquated as we see horse drawn carriages they supposedly manipulate energy on the scale of entire galaxies the energy of a single star almost wouldnt be worth their time
  such a civilization would no longer need energy as they would have complete understanding of planck physics allowing them to do literally anything
  you cant hide from aliens that can see us in real time from another galaxy anon
  molecular absorption cloud or dark nebula similar to the horse head nebula or the dark streaks in the trifid nebula
  barnard68  i know google image search is hard you need at least teo phds in puremaths
  so the gods that everyone worships because they visited earth about 12000 years ago
  fuck off
  stop bullying us brainlets anon 
  aliens that can see us in real time from another galaxy
voids are natural formations
  demonbane
  see baby big foot
  since ftl travel ruins causality its probably not going to ever happen anywhere so even if they had the technology to travel between galaxies theyd lose a huge amount of time getting there though they wouldnt experience most of that time themselves and time available in an expanding universe is limited
  the milky way and nearby galaxies are stuck in the largest void in the universe  how depressing were cut off from the rest of the universe for all eternity
  were cut off from the rest of the universe for all eternity  you ever notice how businesses in areas with high crime tend to move away from those areas
  they are more like unformations
  theres nothing out there anyway its like a video game that just endlessly generates more map when you go to the border after you have seen billion stars you have seen them all
im confused is that pic just falsely described as bootes void or has bootes void been debunked as being a nebula blocking our view instead
  the void is cool ranch nebulas are spicy nacho
    if im reading this right were not stuck inside it but were on the edge
        i know how and why they form but im not telling you guys because it would unleash the next theory of physics to make someone earn the recognition of einstein  the only problem is i cannot do the math yet but ill give you /sci/entists a hint it requires advanced multivarible calculus and a pure grasp of relativity key notes know how to derive delta t time dilation and you can figure it out from there
    150 million lightyears across      2 billion lightyears in diameter  earth is about 10 off the center    150m vs 2g   vs 
  redundant heat pumps reducing the handprint of the heat until it cant be seen from interstellar distances
the local void also appears to have significantly fewer galaxies than expected from standard cosmology    it would be much of a fucking void if it had galaxies in it now would it    i love science
  thats not the bootes void dipshit
  i need as much matter and energy as possible to use as a computational substrate for my waifu simulator so its pretty unfortunate that most of the universe isnt accessible
  voids have everything the more populated areas of the universe has only less so yes voids contain galaxies and shit only less
  nothing the pic said violates the laws of physics
  as far as we know
  theres nothing unphysical afaik about living in a black hole    
  real time  no such thing
    dark matter
  yeah
  youre assuming you understand the technology of a potential civilization capable of building dyson spheres    the escaping energy from a system is wasted only because the system is inefficient a civilization this advanced could potentially have an efficiency far higher than anything we can currently imagine
  black holes are just nuetron stars
  crash course astronomy told me otherwise
  what is their density relative to a normal zone or a super cluster
  its just compress enough that it has an event horizon
  everything has an event horizon bro you me the computer im typing on a single proton etc   its just usually buried so deep inside matter that you cant get to it   also a neutron star isnt the theoretical limit to how dense you can get before you form a black hole you can go beyond the neutron rebound limit and have a quark star
  2030 years bro we just have to hold out until then
  how would your mothers ass provide proof of type 3 civilization
  i guess those are newborn stars amazing
    fascinating shit
  maybe it is a blame type structure
  where the fuck would you get the material for that though
  that amount of material would collapse on its own just from its mass that is indeed the stupidest stupid shit ive seen
space is just the best
  clearly you havent studied chem enough there are metals that can be stable with 300 protons which would evedently be stronger than what elements we have access to now
cheap  strong  lightweight  easy to work with  great conductor  shiny  cool extraction process  aluminum is my favorite element whats yours
your momium lmao
  makes a shitload of fluorine waste to refine it  eventually they start putting it in your drinking water
  makes conspiracy theorists seethe  one more pro of the greatest element out there
  ill be glad when this and all of you are gone hopefully forever there is nothing you wont accept    its very frustrating
  bro chill  have a relaxing video of molten aluminum  
   conductor  easy to work with    no enjoy burning your house down
  the singularity is coming
  i meant easy to work with as in its easy on tools and good for projects not for wiring ill admit thats one of its character flaws  its a loner that doesnt like other metals
also nearly forgot its the material of choice for planes although composites are finally becoming popular
tungsten because im not a pussy ass faggot
  gold
helium is pretty dope
  technetium just because if you mention it to chemists they all instantaneously resign to damnit nuclear physics is too hard for me
  sounds like your mother  ha got em
all about platinum
    none because chemistry ruined my college transcript
  why is it purple
guys cmon weve been over this so many times diamond is the best metal
i like how innocent indium is soft nontoxic low melting point can alloy with gallium and tin just by physically forcing them together
80
  probably color shift the shitty camera
silicon is pretty          dope
6061 t6    welds good takes a 90 strong some flex    goldilocks
  how is everyone just ignoring this genius post shame on everyone
  you mean aluminium
  aluminum
  if people only used al then it would be fine the problem is when it meets copper wires and galvanic action fucks everything up  copper is far superior when weight isnt a consideration though al btfo
  name made by pretentious brainlets who wanted to autistically stim with extra letters  no i dont
  i like guinierpreston zones they are the best zones
  based
  may be vertasium
  on the contrary al likes other metals too much which is why it is difficult to work with in applications where galvanic contact is expected
  favourite elements  writes it like an american subhuman  its aluminium nigger    also step over for carbon  4 valence electrons so it forms complex structures  so important it has its own branch of chemistry that is so overwhelmingly big that its basically 2/3s of the field  forms the components of life and various polymer materials that with enought tweaking can basically replace almost all other materials  carbon allotropes are the materials of the future  some allotrope will probably be used in thzscale spintronics that will lead the second renaissance of computing  has been providing us with energy for over 300 years now leading to modern civilization
  why dont americans also say sodum potassum magnesum calcum etc then why is aluminium different
  its useless
  because it should be uhhloominum ahhloomineeum is gay
  brit subniggers made up a stupid name because it didnt sound gay enough for them   its objectively wrong and invalidates your opinion
  let me light up a match here oops sorry i dropped it
    bot posting
hey /sci/ are you smart enough to solve this most difficult puzzle
  seriously no one can find an answer
  any ideas about how this could be solved
  fail im going to delete this thread since /sci/ is too retarded anyway
  oh lol i cant delete it well thanks anon for spoiling us the fun  everyone give thanks to  anon that spoiled the fun
  i will neck myself soon and no i wont stop posting this trash next time you wont be able to reverse image it and its actually related to science and math you just cant see that especially to the scientific method just think about it what leads someone to discover these things
  good riddance anon the world will be better without you
is making a lightsaber possible
  yes but only with space magic
  where do u get that but what about a saber you dont unsheath but gets really hot like molten heat
  maybe     who knows
molten lead isnt hot at all dumbass
yes but how do you make the saber beam stop
  make a rod from the middle go up fromd the hanlde and at the top of it like a metal disk or some shit and around it the hot light can take place sort of like those mostquito raquet things in a sense that electrocute    molten  melt  never said lead but molten is hot as fuck nigga
i miss him bros
  hes funny as fuck      
  grab a flashlight  tape it to a saber  ay presto lightsaber
  alright alright smart ass aside yes it is possible now ask the following is it ethical
  funny dubs dude is based and efficient    how do you make it mufuhca
  alright take current studies on photons     there was an experiment done recently to sharpen a beam to such an extent that the particles were imparted mass and were frozen in place essentially you could hijack the principal of this exeperiment to make a micro filament that only appears when the blade is turned on     then use it to slice through anything however because it has no tensile strength the strength would depend on how strong the electromagnet below it washowever once the minimum is reached you can cut anything that is not a micro filament of equal or greater frequency and intensity
  there was an experiment done recently to sharpen a beam to such an extent that the particles were imparted mass and were frozen in place
      lol
  dubs man is innit
  if this leads to one being built remember the adeptus mechanicus of mars is watching
  i dont think that article means what you think it means
  did you just   explain why a lightsaber has a minimum and maximum length that varies based on the crystal/power source it uses in real life
      this i have my suspicions why are you telling this to anyone dont you care about any of your ideas being stolen are you an idiot
  sure   whatever helps you sleep at night   
  whatever helps you sleep at night    what the hell are you
  hes the hero /sci/ deserves but not the one it needs right now
one of the criteria for a planet is that it has to have cleared its orbit of asteroids otherwise it becomes a dwarf planet looking at this image of the orbit of jupiter it is clear that much of the asteroid belt is actually contained within its orbit does this mean that jupiter is now a dwarf planet or should scientists reconsider their definition
one of the criteria for a planet is that it has to have cleared its orbit of asteroids    they only made up this bullshit so they could demote pluto they were just looking for a reason
earth also has a significant set of lagrange point asteroids dont we
  it was either that or suddenly theres a lot more planets or we just live with the inconsistency
  suddenly theres a lot more planets    and this is bad why why would it be terrible to acknowledge that our solar system has around 20 planets
  good question
  they just set the terms in such a way as to exclude pluto this was entirely the objective
in the end stages of planet formation a planet as so defined will have cleared the neighbourhood of its own orbital zone meaning it has become gravitationally dominant and there are no other bodies of comparable size other than its natural satellites or those otherwise under its gravitational influence  the trojans and the asteroid belt are totally governed by jupiters gravity
  does this mean that jupiter is now a dwarf planet or should scientists reconsider their definition  this is why i can only stay on /sci/ for about 10 minutes at a time    thanks niggers
  (((they)))  fixed that for you
clearing its neighborhood was added only so that pluto may be excluded as a planet and will eventually have to be revised because it is utterly retarded hackwork
  the reason is that pluto is the templar stronghold and saturn is the mj12 headquarters in the outer solar system (((they))) are attempting to reduce plutos status in the eyes of the world so that public opinion will respond favorably to a military strike on the planet
    by far not the dumbest thing ive read on /sci/
are ganymede titan callisto io europa  triton honorary planets
they should have made an objective and unambiguous definition based on a mass cutoff
  one of the criteria for a planet is that it has to have cleared its orbit of asteroids    no it has to clear the orbit of all bodies of comparable size there are no other gas giants in jupiter orbit hence it is a real planet    sorry pluto but not every rock orbiting the sun deserves to be called a planet there are expected to be hundreds of plutolike bodies in the outer solar system
  not asteroids objects of a comparable or equivalent mass
  sorry pluto but not every rock orbiting the sun deserves to be called a planet  new horizons provided proof that pluto is far from being some dead rock its extremely complex dynamic and has a system of moons this really needs rethinking
  why is it so bad thats not a planet anymore   that does not removes all the consideration it deserves  proof  we have sent a probe to there      probably but they were not planets for too long judging by the enormous mass of jupiter and their distance to it      the mass of the celestial body is the root of the problem actually  if we consider anything like earth as a planet then why not mars then if mars why not mercury then why not pluto and then eris sedna ceres makemake haumea  the thing is with a certain size comes the capacity of clearing its own orbit this fact has been chosen for the redefinition that is indeed more intuitive than objective could we do better  who knows  to get a perfect definition of what is a planet we need more knowledge we need to comprehend others solar systems as accurately as ours
personally i see no problem with the term of dwarf planets its just that theyre not being taught or given enough light
  illuminati confirmed
  planets should be internally differentiated core crust etc so ceres would could but other shitty asteroids would not pluto would definitely be in if its a moon of a much bigger planet but would otherwise be considered a planet in its own right maybe something like planetary moon
  it just kinda sucks how pluto has been thrown down the memory hole in a lot of popular science neptune the final planet of the solar system was discovered in the late 19th century it all seems part of a campaign from some quarters to ignore kuiper belt bodies altogether
  pluto is no joke more dynamic and interesting than uranus
brainlet here what does clearing its own orbit mean
  theres nothing else that shares the orbit with it of comparable size because it ate everything else
  being able to clear out all other minor bodies and asteroids within its orbit
  means that anything else in the same orbit has its orbit completely determined by the main body in question eg in the earths orbit all satellites go where the earth tells them to go
  having enough gravitational influence to eject everything in its course or crossing its orbit  thats why the inner solar system is so empty because planets act literally like billards balls
  like billards balls on asteroids
  one of the criteria for a planet is that it has to have cleared its orbit of asteroids  no thats not the criteria the criteria is that it has clear its orbit of competing bodies there are no bodies in jupiters orbit that can compete with it  the same cannot be said about pluto
  one of the criteria for a planet is that it has to have cleared its orbit of asteroids  i wish scientists would justify this definition  it seems like an arbitrary property that was concocted in order to distinguish the special named celestial bodies from everything else  the named celestial bodies came first and this bullshit definition came after  start with bodies we think are special for some reason  find more bodies that we think arent special for some reason  invent some contrived classifier that agrees with our arbitrary sense of special  are they just overfitting the data in order to make their arbitrary sense of special seem formal
  yes and it was done by orbital dynamics specialists they convened a special meeting of the iau when they were sure of having a majority and forced it through
  by their definition none of the planets of trappist1 are truly planets because they are all in resonance with each other therefore they are not fully in control of their own orbits

planes fly over a curved earth
  they ware called plan as but it failed rockets used to be called plan fs
  so they were plan e
  yes now there are multiple of them
  and they account for curvature
  to define curvature you need to have minimum 1 plane
  yes because pilots attempt to maintain a steady altitude and this is hard if you try to maintain 20000 ft for example you will find that sometimes you will be 19500 and sometimes you will be 22000 etc you wont notice that the general trend is that you are needing to correct downward more than you are needing to correct upward
  do we have 1 plane
  why are planes called planes  they arent you retarded ameriburger the word comes from the french planer which means to glide or to soar
  yes
  but if they flew level the same angle the whole time their altitude would constantly increase correct
  doesnt matter where the word comes from theyre still called planes nigger
  the same angle  the same angle to what the trim of an airplane is a positive angle with respect to the ground below when it gains altitude only it keeps this angle constant for cruising
  glide or soar over what you repugnant brainlet
  now what
  over the aer thats greek meaning air you wretched faggot
  go wild  
  imagine a plane on the ground rising up maintaining the same angle perpendicular to ground below it like a helicopter rising it gets to 20000ft and starts moving forward maintaining the same angle would its altitude constantly increase
  is the angle with respect to the ground more than zero yes
  youre ust making shit up you monumental buffoon
  already read brainlet how often do aeroplanes adjust for the earths curvature
  so aeroplanes need to constantly adjust to maintain altitude as they fly over the earth
  continuously pilots constantly look at instruments and adjust to maintain an angle of attack of 0 if they wish to fly at constant altitude
  yes the adjustment is very small because the earth is huge
  false
  are you a pilot
  lets say youre at 30000ft and you travel 100 miles how much adjustment is required to maintain the same altitude
  how do you quantize adjustment
  had flying lesson
  youre not getting that by maintaining altitude you are not maintaining angle
  keeping the plane perpendicular to the surface of the earth pushing the nose down
  utterly untrue if you actually took a flying lesson youd know
  a little less than 15 degrees roughly
  huh all i said is that maintaining the same angle will not maintain altitude which is logically consistent with what youve just said
  which would be done constantly correct
  you apparently are unable to realize that the device you think is accurately telling you your angle is in fact constantly being adjusted to point downward due to gravity          you dont understand what level means level means perpendicular to down technically if you flew with the goal of maintaining the exact same angle as at a time of your choosing your altitude would increase but you would now no longer be flying level thus in order to maintain level you must maintain your altitude meaning that you are constantly correcting downward      constantly but unknowingly because your altitude varies so much it is essentially impossible to tell that you are correcting downward more than you are correcting upward because in that 100 mile range you would inevitably find yourself both above and below your target altitude at certain points in time
  you apparently are unable to realize that the device you think is accurately telling you your angle is in fact constantly being adjusted to point downward due to gravity   embed  posting known fraudsters video gyros do not work like that it would require them to be subject to gravity which they arent the whole point of gyros try again
  you dont understand what level means level means perpendicular to down technically if you flew with the goal of maintaining the exact same angle as at a time of your choosing your altitude would increase but you would now no longer be flying level thus in order to maintain level you must maintain your altitude meaning that you are constantly correcting downward  how can an aeroplane which is flat be perpendicular to something curved
  the video proves me wrong therefore it is false    flat earthers  every time      jeezus fucking christ would tangent work better for your pedantic ass
  constantly but unknowingly because your altitude varies so much it is essentially impossible to tell that you are correcting downward more than you are correcting upward because in that 100 mile range you would inevitably find yourself both above and below your target altitude at certain points in time  why would that be
  be flat earther  endlessly complain about ad hominem fallacies because people call you retarded  unironically use an ad hominem fallacy while providing no argument other than they dont work like that
  flat earthers  every time  isnt it funny how this cant be shown in an actual plane you have to rely on manipulative fraudsters instead
  jeezus fucking christ would tangent work better for your pedantic ass  which part of the plane would be tangent to the earths surface
  while providing no argument other than they dont work like that  did you miss the part about gyros not being subject to gravity you insidious fool
    a desert road that looks perfectly straight has more side to side curvature than the earth has up and down curvature do you notice yourself correcting for the extremely slight wiggles in the road then the answer is no no you dont this is because you swerve side to side naturally because you are a human and you are not perfect at controlling things      perform an experiment requiring a perfectly level body on a body that is almost impossible to keep level  implying there is any difference between gyros already inside airplanes and gyros sold do you with the idea that you will be putting it into your airplane      do you seriously have to create a separate reply for every argument you try and put forth is it to try and make it seem like there is more than one retard in this thread      gyros are not subject to gravity    holy shit you are a literal retard arent you have you ever even handled an actual gyroscope in case you are wondering yes gyroscopes are in fact subject to gravity spinning something really fast doesnt magically turn off gravity it just makes sure it continues to point the same direction
  gyros do not work like that it would require them to be subject to gravity which they arent the whole point of gyros  gyros are subject to gravity
  a desert road that looks perfectly straight has more side to side curvature than the earth has up and down curvature do you notice yourself correcting for the extremely slight wiggles in the road then the answer is no no you dont this is because you swerve side to side naturally because you are a human and you are not perfect at controlling things  what are you blabbering about a plane flying from canada to south america will need to account for a serious amount of curvature constantly throughout the flight but they dont because there is no curvature  perform an experiment requiring a perfectly level body on a body that is almost impossible to keep level  implying there is any difference between gyros already inside airplanes and gyros sold do you with the idea that you will be putting it into your airplane  gyros in planes are used for artificial horizons the artificial horizon never moves up or down like the video shows it is purely used to keep the wings level with the flat ground beneath no curvature is taken into account  do you seriously have to create a separate reply for every argument you try and put forth is it to try and make it seem like there is more than one retard in this thread  yes and its working your autist rage is delicious    holy shit you are a literal retard arent you have you ever even handled an actual gyroscope in case you are wondering yes gyroscopes are in fact subject to gravity spinning something really fast doesnt magically turn off gravity it just makes sure it continues to point the same direction  you utter moron i dont mean antigravity in the sense it floats away its in the sense that gravity wont affect its angle in space therefore it cannot be used in a plane travelling over a sphere
  not in the sense a plane would require if flying over a sphere
  if someone that spoke english invented it things would be diferent
  experiments on earth show that yes they are
planes dont actually fly in an exact altitude they fly in a pressure level
  what would it be called
  prove it brainlet
  round
  jej
  go to an etymology site instead of asking an anime site
  what are you blabbering about a plane flying from canada to south america will need to account for a serious amount of curvature constantly throughout the flight but they dont because there is no curvature    dismisses with no counter argument    flat earthers  every time    gyros in planes are used for artificial horizons the artificial horizon never moves up or down like the video shows it is purely used to keep the wings level with the flat ground beneath no curvature is taken into account    intentionally stating a falsehood that directly contradicts the design documents in the very gyros were talking about    flat earthers  every time    you utter moron i dont mean antigravity in the sense it floats away its in the sense that gravity wont affect its angle in space therefore it cannot be used in a plane travelling over a sphere    not understanding that were talking about gyros that are specifically designed to self correct all airplane gyros   not understanding the argument at all  not understanding    flat earthers  every time
  no u
  yhurmahmghey
  a curved pressure level
  gyros are used in airplanes
  silly brainlet ive had a flying lesson i know how this shit works you are just babbling nonsense in your state of scichosis
  why are hydroplanes called hydroplanes
  ur mom gay with my mom
  exactly
  and they remain rigid in space dont they brainet
  my dad said youre mom is a slut who lets all the guys take a poop on her chest in the back room of the bar on the weekends
  a flat aeroplane flying through a curved pressure gradient
  curved but irregular
  thats why the wings of an airplane are curved
  you misheard then dipshit she has a chest like a treasure chest that she lets people shit in which she then uses as manure for her garden she told me your dad actually ate all of the shit in there once he has now been banned
  even worse
  yep so how do they work in airplanes how do they account for the curvature of the earth    wwwgooglecom
  the wings match the curvature of the earth impressive
  do you think our atmosphere is regular    thats not why they are curved
   how do they account for the curvature of the earth  they dont just like rail guns dont
  do you think our atmosphere is regular  no which is why using pressure to account for curvature wont work particularly a pressure thats not only irregular but curved too
  why wouldnt it work
  powered by water
why do you faggots keep feeding the schizos ignore them and laugh at them they are beyond help unfortunately ive talked to nurses about this all you can hope to do is to alleviate their minds through drugs which unfortunately also cause a myriad of ugly side effects pity them dont argue with them
  i like to see different views
  because its irregular
  and
  muh schizophrenia111  typical cultist response science doesnt care about your feelings go find a musk thread you stardust schizo
  how does an irregular pressure allow a plane account for curvature
  why does it need to be an exact curve
  pretty important for it to be as close as possible so that you reach the destination in time deviation fucks everything up
  airplanes arent in space
  he thinks there arent deviations in flight times  i see you have never flown in your life
  fallacy of equivocation
  not because they cant remain level with the ground beneath you putrid hog    it would also be much harder to land the passengers wouldnt feel level itd be a constant battle that doesnt happen in reality
  ive had a flying lesson    those are your credentials lmao you have yet to provide any concrete counter example to what im saying
  you are one aggressive nigger
        why are you replying to yourself also no matter how much you want to schitzo babble it away airplane gyros do in fact adjust themselves constantly to account for curvature youre stating things as fact despite the fact that you have repeatedly been shown to be wrong via direct counter example the fact that i can go ahead and provide a direct example showing you to be incorrect yet you continue to commit almost every logical fallacy imaginable to convince yourself that somehow the opposite is true shows that you should probably subject your own mechanisms of thought to rigorous analysis not that it would do anything of course because schitzophrenia prevents you from being able to do that dont you find it suspicious that every single counterexample to every point flat earth era push just so happens to be miraculously wrong in some way that is obvious to you but nobody else
  yes that would be the fallacy of assuming that gyros behave exactly the same in space as they would much closer to a large gravitational body      it would also be much harder to land the passengers wouldnt feel level itd be a constant battle that doesnt happen in reality  no it wouldnt feeling level and actually being level are two grossly different things you feel level during takeoff and landing climbs and descents but youre actually at a several degree inclination  and it is a constant battle pilots do most of the actual flying of the plane during takeoff and landing on commercial flights
  passengers wouldnt feel level    more proof that you have never flown in your life you almost never feel level on an airplane and you do realize that level streets are almost always not level by more then two degrees right
  guarantee theyre better than yours brainlet the pilot even showed me how to use the trim to level the plane out so that you can take your hands off the controls and the plane will remain at the same altitude impossible on your schizosphere
  youre one sensitive troglodyte
  how does a gyro work
  not sure if youre retarded or a baiter but    in the real world the atmosphere gets thinner as you gain altitude a plane in steady flight maintains an equilibrium between the angle of attack of the wing and thrust of the engines that keeps the plane within a level of atmosphere where its rarity is more or less the same but uses occasional minor trim when local pressure and density varies slightly there is no downward pointing or correcting such nonsense
  dumb nigger dont even know how to talk like a civilized human
  why are you replying to yourself  stop projecting your schizophrenia onto me brainlet    the counter example you posted was plugged into a computer being artificially edited not using the natural forces it is supposed to prove    artificial horizons are purely mechanical in a lot of cases they are not plugged into computers the one in the plane i was in did not change in the way that pseudoscientific video shows if it did then show it in the actual plane the guy is a pilot there is no excuse  no it wouldnt feeling level and actually being level are two grossly different things you feel level during takeoff and landing climbs and descents but youre actually at a several degree inclination  you dont feel level during take off and landing you autist which is why you have to wear a seat belt during those periods
  plugged into a computer  do you know what a power supply is    you can literally get the exact same one he has off ebay and try it yourself the fact that nobody has done this so far shows that he is legit    gyros self correct please stop being retarded
  yes you do brainlet but if flying over a sphere itd be much much worse
  you dont honestly think that incurring a massive one degree per 15 minutes change in angle would be even the slightest bit nodicibke do you
  but if flying over a sphere itd be much much worse  i dont think you have grasped just how large this sphere is
   itd be much much worse  because why
  by spinning around an axis which balances itself out perfectly due to being circular thereby creating its own separate stationary plane of reference to everything else around it
  everybody laugh at this post holy shit i knew flat earners were bad but this is beyond just beyond this is more of understanding this is a complete incapability to grasp even the most basic prerequisite concepts
  we cant all be a classy globe disciple like you
  oh dear brainlet why would he need to buy some custom made gyro off ebay when he has the real thing in his plane that is not a real artificial horizon used in a plane ive seen one with my own eyes which is why he hasnt filmed the real thing how gullible are you
  one degree per 15 minutes change in angle  did you just pull that out of your anus
  big sphere  big amount of curvature which increases exponentially as you keep travelling without accounting for it    because flying around a ball is much harder than over a plane everything is constantly changing and must be accounted for in order to maintain consistency
  how does spinning do that
  everybody mock this post holy shit globe disciples love to claim that those who oppose them have no idea what theyre talking about and dont understand basic high school physics but this claim is never actually backed up with evidence of their own     what youre really saying is that im not regurgitating the scripture your globe cult ascribes to therefore im wrong questioning established science is what true science is about you are antiscience
  you have no evidence  post direct counter example  tththats not real evidence
  as far as i know the rotor that spins needs to be circular or at least a shape that is not irregular because the shape needs to evenly distribute the spin force in a way that it is kept perfectly balanced    the force cant be ejected towards a particular direction with a circular rotor because every direction is equal which is the same as there being no direction without a direction without a beginning and end the spin force has no option but to remain perfectly balanced the rotor and the spin force at this point become one inseparable
  learn something brainlet    many gyros include a manual caging device used to erect the rotor to its normal operating position prior to flight or after tumbling and a flag to indicate that the gyro must be uncaged before use turning the caging knob prevents rotation of the gimbals and locks the rotor spin axis in its vertical position because the rotor is spinning as long as vacuum power is supplied normal manoeuvring with the gyro caged wears the bearings unnecessarily     therefore the instrument should be left uncaged in flight unless the limits are to be exceeded in the caged position the gyro is locked with the miniature aircraft showing level flight regardless of aircraft attitude when uncaged in flight in any attitude other than level flight the gyro will tend to remain in an unlevel plane of rotation with the erecting mechanism attempting to restore the rotor to a horizontal plane therefore should it be necessary to uncage the gyro in flight the actual aircraft attitude must be identical to the caged attitude that is straight and level otherwise the instrument will show false indications when first uncaged
  big sphere  big amount of curvature  no you fucking idiot  its actually the complete opposite
  youd need to constantly deal with that curvature you imbecile all youd need to do to gain altitude is fly in a constant straight line the earth will gradually get lower and lower yet no one has ever done this i wonder why
  because you have no idea how flying works
  that refers to a gyro where there is no auto stabilizing mechanism    see  manual caging
  walk up and drop your spaghetti all over a pilot  take his lack of an immediate articulate response to your dumb question as some kind of a victory  jesus flat earthers are cringeworthy
  pedantic  is a pejorative only where education is undervalued as in your primitive tribal village
  angle of attack is basically the angle between where your nose is pointing and where you are going  its not vertical speed  you can have an angle of attack of zero and be heading straight down    t planefag who likes to switch his cat switch to cat i when flying his f16 with a cat 3 load to get a couple more degrees of aoa in falcon bms
  112 of the pilots basic study guide     this kills the globalist
  if the earth was a globe that kind of response wouldnt make sense
  yes it does i cannot explain to an autistic person the reason that non autistic people recoil at their nonsense
  the because the wings are planes that give it lift
  idiot gravity will pull the plane down and parallel to the surface as it travels around the globe traveling a completely straight trajectory relative to earth pointing out of the atmosphere would require readjusting constantly
  youre being the autist you can tell he knows its flat but is afraid to admit it
  gravity will pull the plane down and parallel to the surface  which part of the plane
  of course it does the guy asking the question didnt give away that hes a conspiracy tard so the pilot thought that a fellow normal person asked him about that ridiculous belief his shrug basically communicated its funny what more can i say
  this still applies to you  
  umm the manual says they want to simplify the equations hence the convenience of a flat earth model its for simpletons to help them understand the rest curvature is added later the basics are understood and when the flaws of the basics reveal themselves because theres curvature  but you knew that troll    what i dont understand is why do you argue about something where you clearly have no training or understanding youre basically talking gibberish and feign anger over spewing this nonsense what gives
  all of the plane but thats still a bad explanation  someone answered it kinda better before you need to remember there is more than just gravity involved in this equation the counter to gravity in flight is lift which is a component of velocity air density and drag all of these things are being balanced together to create level flight  if you were to simplify it down an imagine the atmosphere was completely uniform with no changes in wind or air pressure and you pointed the plane in one direction relative to space not the earth below it you still wouldnt gain altitude over time and fly out into space because you arent generating more lift to counter gravity what you would eventually do is stall    its the same answer to that fucking question of taking off by flying completely straight eventually the ground would fall away under you its a stupid idea that would require extremely precise control to eliminate any errors and eventually youd stall anyway      if the earth was flat that kind of response wouldnt make sense
  
/sci/ i answered a then c no idea for the last one    what do you reckon the good formula is 
i dont speak faggot sorry can you post it in english
i dont speak faggot sorry can you post it in english
i dont speak sorry can you post it in faggot
  dumb frogposter
      one deduces from all those previous answers that      if you know for sure that both previous answers are correct it is easy enough to just combine them algebraically what exactly are you having trouble with
  its a dumb shit obviously some totality formula like efficiency
  well im studying by myself all the highschool math / physics program you have to determine the distance measured by a radar between two points with the radar emitting two impulsions at t1 and t2 and the time they bounce back to the radar being delta t1 and delta t2 i just cant figure question 3 with what i picked on 1 and 2
  use distance equals rate times time and your two answers and combine them algebraically
  lmfao youre pretty based anon
what fundamentally determines the enthalpy of reactions    for example oxidizing methane to co2 yields 820 kj/mol and oxidizing h2s to so4 yields 728 kj/mol but what about determines the energy generated what about the atom/orbitals/breaking of that specific bond results in a specific value can these be predicted or must they always be empirically measured    pic unrelated    thanks

  not safe sex
two guys use the same condom at the same time    or one guy uses the entirety of the other guy as a condom to fuck the woman hes not fucking the man even though his penis is in his asshole hes merely using him as a condom in the same way youre not fucking a condom when performing sexual interxourse with a woman
  first one fucks without
tiddyfuck
  this
i figured it out stand back everyone big shot coming through    let mathm_1m_2m_3/math denote the three men let mathf/math denote the female let mathsupset_1 supset_2/math denote the condoms  we will say that m_1 fucked f with condom 1 by writing mathm_1supset_1 f/math it is also possible to double bag condoms  moreover it is possible to flip condoms inside out we will denote this with a superscript ie condom 1 flipped is denoted mathsupset1/math    now the solution is as follows  1 mathm_1supset_1supset_2 f/math  2 mathm_2supset_2 f/math  3 mathm_3supset1supset_2 f/math    note it is okay to doublebag the condoms because we are given as an axiom that they will not break this is not okay in real life as doublebagging greatly increases the risk of breakage
  one women  is that conjoined twins
  correct answer but nonstandard notation in the future use mathm_3supset_11supset_2f/math
  fuck how do you do this
  i didnt want to use that because it would imply that doing  mathsupset_1supset_11/math  is isomorphic to fucking raw and it clearly isnt
  you might be confused about the definition of the contraceptive inverse in general we have  eqnasupset_1supset_2ldotssupset_n1supset_n biff bsupset_n1supset_n11ldotssupset_21supset_11a/eqnso the only condom that can satisfy the relation mathasupset_1supset_11b/math is the null condom
  fuck this isnt working
  lmao
  genius
  why do you have to double bag at all
  two guys use the same condom at the same time  what
  whats your solution
can the mean of any two consecutive prime numbers be prime  consecutive prime numbers    really jogs the nog
  with two condoms you have four total surfaces the woman gets one surface and each guy gets a surface you double bag so that you can use surfaces from different condoms at the same time
  two dudes put their dicks into one condom at the same time
  gay and not safe
  are you implying there arent consecutive prime numbers because there are retard
    that inverse notation is only used when things cancel out under some sort of composition or multiplication in this context the identity would have to be no condom but composition of condoms ie doublebagging doesnt result in cancellation    that notation would only make sense if you could do stuff like this  mathm_1supset_13supset_12f  m_1supset_1 f/math      see picture do you have another solution that doesnt involve double bagging keep in mind that since there are only two condoms with two sides each ie four sides total each person must be assigned their own side of a condom that means that the woman cant use both condoms separately
    retards
      retards
  as opposed to the supposedly correct answer of double bagging and turning them inside out
  give 2 guys the condoms and have them take the ass and vagina then have the 3rd guy on the mouth because stds cant be transmitted orally
  elementary conundrum    whats my prize
  one in the pink one in the stink one in the hand
  include me in the screencap
  because stds cant be transmitted orally
  stomach acids and saliva would kill any pathogens in the ejaculate
  prime numbers are social construct bigot so is math
  23 thats it
  
  speaking of oral your mom should have swallowed you
  well technically theyre not wrong
  well 25 isnt prime so the answer to the op is no
  if only 1 were prime too
  the answer would still be no any consecutive primes would average to a number ending in 5 also any twin primes will average to the even number between then which are never prime
  prove it bitch
  math123/math are consecutive and mathtextrmavg123/math is math2/math      take a grade school health class on safe sex idiot
  any two consecutive primes  two  can you not count or can you not read
  a teacher told me therefore it must be true  yet im the dumb one
  whats your point that i was right
              here you go illustrated
  kek
  go ahead share condoms and suck diseased dick i dont care
  double bagging  safe  pick one
  when did i say share condoms dont put words in my mouth
  i called two retards out one who shared condoms  and one who thinks oral stds arent a thing 
  well i wasnt the first guy so basically yes
  if cant handle talking to 2 people at once then dont
    sorry my mistake i shouldve known which retard i was talking to the moment you said  dont put words in my mouth
  retard   keep telling yourself that maybe itll become true eventually

  elegant solution  falls apart under pedantry  lmao gb2/lit/ you brainlet this is /sci/ pedantic solutions are the only solutions
  muh board culture  okay heres your pedantic solution the woman fists one man while getting dicked by the other two now that ive quelled your autism we can discuss how most ideal answers involve the woman using manual stimulation before opening the conversation on how youve never had sex
  board culture  its math people culture  the woman fists one man while getting dicked by the other two now that ive quelled your autism  fisting counts as safe i think that actually is an elegant solution certainly much better than your garbage nonsolution in the last post
  let mathsupset_1 supset_2/math denote the condoms  heh  pretty good solution too
  i think were missing some definitions here  is intercourse limited to only vaginal sex or is any orifice kosher would a handjob count as intercourse  also how do we define safe is safe referring to minimum risk of pregnancy or are diseases taken into account  ie would a blowjob or anal sex be considered safe without a condom the risk of pregnancy is not there but plenty of room is left for diseases
told u yall niggas were gay
  isnt double bagging considered less safe than just putting on the regular condom  something about friction increasing the chance for tears
  unbreakable condoms read the instructions or youre never going to make it  but also if you werent a virgin youd know and would ask about double bagging
  read the instructions or youre never going to make it  mother fucker this is my achilles heel missing points like that in a question  ive fucked up so many questions specifically because of that
  putting your dick in a condom another man has used is not safe
  its the same virus you nonce

so i know all of you are at least moderately intelligent but being moderately intelligent alone does not necessarily cut it for being academically successful how do you all cultivate discipline and focus     theres all this bombardment of useless youtube and social media shit that develops abnormal addiction patterns how do you start weaning yourself off this and enjoying true personal development as an aspiring scientist self studying texts practicing creative hobbies etc
  i second this literally me need help
  to be successful in the highly competitive world of research or anything you have to be hungry for it to the extent that not succeeding at it is feels like not breathing if you have thoughts like ill get to it eventually ive done enough ive earned a break i just need to chill out a bit first with some youtube then objectively you are not someone who suffocates with lack of progress toward the goal you do not have that innate disposition and thus you are not going to be highly successful you might want to reject this truth its easy to deny until you actually meet somebody who is highly successful upon which it immediately becomes clear that they are a different type of person to you they have no experience of not even a conception of the issues you describe and that you probably think they have overcome somehow
  this makes me want to anhero    everything in life is competitive im fucked
  everything in life is competitive  not everything is equally as competitive before you commit suede ask yourself why you dont that badly want what you think you want you might find something like because honestly im happy playing video games most of the time i kind of like just watching tv if this is your actual nature why not just be comfortable with it why not get a lowish level office job and turn your brain off then go home and play vidya/do sci puzzles for 16 hours probably just because of stupid egotism you got the idea you were one of the best so you feel like youre not living up to it why do you have this idea
  do a digital detox to the extent you feel necessary browsing 4chan would be unacceptable but reading papers or pdf books that are relevant to what you want to learn would be acceptable video games would be unacceptable but doing something amusing for a while in reality would be fine using your phone for logistics reasons is fine but anything else is unacceptable replacing your smartphone with a basic flip phone would help majorly here
  what i mean is youre probably average so you could just embrace being average
  since we are so used to have stimulation all the time we cant spend 5 minutes before checking social media or emails or 4chan    that fucked me so hard and caused me long periods of procrastination     i try not to touch computer at home go out and read books it helps implementation intentions also helped
  because im not going to just take all their mocksympathy and arrogant elitism like some fucking undesirable they all make fun of me this is not a delusion i hear them talking about me sometimes in their sarcastic nasally voices     i understand everything fine im not dumb or average i simply can not fucking function i start down to work and zip 4 fucking hours have already passed and i havent finished the first one yet time moves like 10 times faster for me in those four hours i dont really get stuck or confused as much as everyone just assumes it always feels like im thinking and making steady progress i know you will simply just reply and say smugly well you must not be very smart     ive always had this dream to do this since i was a kid literally go fuck yourself if you want me to just give up on my dreams im destroyed financially if i do as well student loans and what not i have zero fucking prospects inside my field and zero outside once you fuck up enough times not one person will give you another chance doesnt matter that you are thousands of dollars in the holeyou dont have the gpa for grad school i literally cannot think of a single thing that works as a positive on my resume no connections no experience no grades no nothing of course they tell me im priveledged that i dont need support groups or people literally paying for me to simply exist like women and minorities
  you seem confused  as in your posts contradict each other but maybe the confusion is also part of the problem youre having with study as well in op you said you get distracted by youtube and have a fucked up attention pattern ie cant concentrate in this post you say you do concentrate and work steadily on the problem but time zips past anyway   are you sure youre working on the problem for the whole four hours or are you kind of halfdistracted and daydreaming at the same time but you dont remember what you daydreamed
      zip 4 fucking hours have already passed and i havent finished the first one yet  what are you talking about math problems    im not dumb or average i simply can not fucking function  i hate to be mean to you because your overall situation sounds pretty bad however it sounds like you are overestimating your abilities     people literally paying for me to simply exist like women and minorities  minorites and to a lesser extent women have pretty huge leeway to beings incompetent in jobs this i wont deny and its unfair however you should probably stop blaming them to cope they at least have to be vaguely competent while your description of yourself makes you sounds totally incompetent     overall you sound pretty miserable anon good luck
losing track of time when focusing could be hyperfocus symptom of adhd executive function disorder get tested medicated you will likely see improvement in focus organising yourself get checked for autism too the conditions go hand in hand not joking
  adhd  meme disease
  dont jack off
  dont jack off  fuck off retard
  why is academic success the metric of this board why wouldnt it be financial success    learning math well and being in debt and having a boss your entire life doesnt see like the intelligent thing to do     modern academia is a fucking sham
  you dont wean shit bro  you just do it
  lmao its part of the whole depriving yourself of excessive stimulation strategy just try it
  what if you hate wasting time but cant do anything productive either and you are mostly just locked into staring at the ceiling or aimlessly browsing 4chan
  because the aim of science is to describe the world not move it or move in it
  then you dont really hate wasting time you just lie to yourself that you do
  i will never be happy living like this
  not happy is exactly why you are living how you are not happy is miles below the threshold of unpleasant required to justify the great effort it takes to change thus you will always be not happy unless some kind of external events conspire to force you to change which would be a great blessing
    me too addicted to novelty of new information i know i wont make practical use of i realized i could only read 10000 books in my lifetime at best and had an existential crisis last month currently on amazon sorting through absolutely all the books in each related section
  you sound like you need professional help i am serious you arent seeing clearly right now because bad cognitive habits are leading you to feel stressed in a way that youre not even cognizant of this is why everything in your life seems inconquerable youre in a mood
  the philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways the point however is to change it
  lol thanks karl marx for telling me the point presumptuous cunt much
  i realized i could only read 10000 books in my lifetime  oh no
  what affordance does a description of the world provide other than the ability to change it
  how stupid are you that you cant understand that doing something with knowledge is another field well i say stupid  i know youve decided your angle as a philosophical point of view so its possible youre not stupid but rather evil commie
  actual retard
  just take drugs lol
  why wouldnt it be financial success  because this is sci and not biz
  action cat be discordant from morals  obsessions/addictions/compulsions cant develop with insight  no
first time being on this board i feel like a brainlet and thats cause i am
  i know that feel bruh
  his claim of hate is not really a moral stance in this case in this thread we are dealing more with desire  i did it even though i know its wrong  is quite common  i did it even though i didnt have any desire to  is quite rare in this sort of thing hence my thesis   i didnt do it even though i wanted to  i didnt want to  or rather you didnt want to enough to overcome the various background hesitations fear of failure/success etc
i work as a welder/fabricator in an extremely small 4 man environment we always push the envelope with experimental metals and woods i guess we all go home and think of things to try in the morning theres no textbook the drive only exists because we share it i dont know how helpful that is but its real world
  of course they tell me im priveledged that i dont need support groups or people literally paying for me to simply exist like women and minorities  fuck off faggot your grades are not minorities fault you cant even spell privilege you are the nigger that you hate whites and asians are like 80 of graduate students in the sciences stop blaming other people for not being able to break out of the bottom 20 of potential grad students      its just lazy to chalk it up to human nature       truth is youtube news feeds etc are ridiculously addictive and what makes it worse is its basically impossible to avoid them if you work in an engineering field or science field since youre always at a computer and as usual online kids want to blackpill you into thinking you can do nothing about it this issue can actually be fixed the answer is in habit formation   we can reduce the seemingly intractable problem of where do i get focus and discipline to what are the habits conducive to focus and discipline and how do i form them  id continue but i dont spend more than 30 minutes on 4chan before i go to sleep so ill post more tomorrow morning during my morning coffee
  
    i saw a post last week that suggested that there is a quick way to cure this problem someone screencapped this post and its getting passed around i thought id saved it but i cant find it so if anyone has a copy please post it essentially the gist of the post was that all of this miniaddictions are just tiny dopamine traps were constantly allowing ourselves small doses of novelty in the form of constantly viewing new usergenerated content giving us a neverending stream of minor dopamine rushes since we didnt evolve in an environment where this degree of constant novelty was available to us we dont have any mechanisms in place to allow our dopaminergic reward systems to neglect it so this environment easily traps us in cycles of addiction i guess its similar to the way that some portion of the population can be suddenly turned into a mindless brainlet by exposure to a highly stimulating game of chance such as a slot machine but it seems to affect a greater  of the population the poster added that all ratbased experiments on these sorts of learned rewarddependence models had revealed that the behaviour could be untrained in an average of 7 days by leaving the rats in an environment devoid of significant sensory stimuli based on this the poster suggested that we could relieve ourselves of these addictive pathways in the same way apparently if you remove yourself from as many pleasurable stimuli as possible for a whole week and then gradually reintroduce only the stimuli you desire to associate with pleasurable reward you can easily retrain yourself to derive the same pleasure you would normally get from spamming yourself from things like studying math reading books or practicing the piano the poster claimed that he had essentially forced himself to eat bland food watch no tv and stare at blank walls for several days and then slowly allowed himself to read apparently he was able to easily enjoy studying afterwards
  this guy is one of those faggots who comes on here to try to make other people feel bad so he can feel better about himself hes probably failing out of first year cognitive science courses right now     you can occasionally watch youtube vids and still be a successful researcher
  lol i was gonna say that
   you might want to reject this truth its easy to deny until you actually meet somebody who is highly successful upon which it immediately becomes clear that they are a different type of person to you  this is useless to think about with that attitude youd basically never accept moderate academic success if you constantly compare yourself to the most successful people in your field youll never be motivated to achieve local success which you need to before you can even think about stepping up in the field
  feel better about himself   no its because of that that i feel good i was greatly relieved to be unburdened of the illusion that topflite people were like me but pushed through their bullshit and realise they have a totally different disposition its true im kind of left without new more appropriate goal and am neetcoasting you could say thats its own problem but i definitely dont feel bad see the follow up post   if someones problem is just impulse control or whatever thats fine maybe detox will help but a lot of people could do well to try this consider that i anon dont believe you are addicted to distractions etc i propose that instead you just dont want to be a top researcher bad enough to choose concentrating over pleasurable activities if you want to prove me wrong go and concentrate on your work for 1 hour if you find yourself giving up at that moment ask yourself whether youre giving up because youve got widthdrawls or whether youre giving up because haha fuck it i dont actually give a shit just try to catch your thought at that moment
  but you just said what i argue i am telling them not to compare to themselves to the top people
smoke weed everyday
  wtf 10000 books is a lot why are you worried
  this guy makes it seem like some kind of predestination shit but for me it was kind of like this  you have to keep in mind the image of you sitting on your ass staring at a screen laughing like a toddler at dumb meme videos while theres a pile of unfinished work behind you that one of your classmates who is three years younger than you is already finished with you have to understand how absurd it is to enroll in college education take all these classes and set up these goals for yourself and then just waste it away to indulge in a few extra hours of childish entertainment a night    we should honestly make threads like /fat people hate/ on /fit/ except here its procrastinator hate just post all the statuses and tweets of people wasting their own or their parents money enrolling in a degree and pissing it all away for fucking memes and then post videos of people complaining about the thousands of dollars of student debt theyre in or how theyre unemployed with a stem degree how could this happen o    understand the trajectory you are on and how grave the consequences are the trouble is you dont realize how pathetic you are until its too late you have to visualize your future failure
  cant think of a societal change more costly to life satisfaction for individuals in the west than the abandonment of shame
   so i am probably not what you would describe as a topflite researcher im a firstyear phd student ive had moderate success in research in my discipline and i had top grades at a very bad school in my undergrad so i am okay and of course i do tend to allow myself to waste time sometimes but that is not to say that i dont have any idea of what the experience of being a topflite scientist would be like ive certainly experienced periods of better discipline like when i was pulling data together for a paper i coauthored or when i was taking one class i particularly liked in my bachelours and teaching other students on the board or when i was writing my thesis during some of these events i experienced a sort of fleeting clarity now im not like that all the time but i can certainly imagine what it would be like and i know for sure that the satisfaction that living that experience provides is more concrete than the temporary pleasure that dopamine traps like tv and vidya provide and i know that if i go long enough without feeling it i spiral into depression that doesnt mean i cant let myself watch a movie or two it just means that the preponderance of my time needs to be spent doing useful shit and i cant let pleasurable habits spiral out of control
  but what i mean is that performing like the top people is an attainable goal if you allow yourself to be comfortable with your local level of success at every level along the way so that you can surpass it  you do not have that innate disposition and thus you are not going to be highly successful  not necessarily true/ you are not going to be as successful but you can be locally successful and you can work your way up from there people without the innate disposition can achieve many of the same things over time with discipline and the absence of the feeling of satisfaction that comes with success is more and more painful the more times you experience the feeling so eventually you just gain that disposition
i dont even have the self control to sit down and read all of that    
  wrong accepting your shitty nature and all that it will bring is at least as hard as changing yourself    probably just because of stupid egotism  gj insulting him for no reason
  im surprised no one suggested leechblock yet it blocks useless websites for a certain period of time so you can stay focus    as for mobile just spend a few dollars for website block app dont be a stingy fuck we all know your selfdiscipline is shit
  why do you pretend that academic and financial success are somehow mutually exclusive you probably just fell for one of those dumb memes people use to justify sucking at their field like bill gates was a dropout
  found it on /sig/ over at /fit/
    meant to reply to this post   i found the post i was talking about
  is the tldr of this  just dont do negative habits cold turkey
  has it helped anyone 
hey op try changing your diet to low or zero carbs i only eat meat and its comfy as fuck i sleep only 55 hours and feel completely rested its the simplest diet to have and its healthy too just eat some beef and some organ meats once a week or so you get more time since you eat the same thing every day and you can also eat only one meal a day    also exercising every morning you can do only 20 minutes light exercise and itll improve your focus throughout the day and your fitness    you can also try meditating just sit down and focus on your breathing for 15 minutes its a proven method to increase focus and remove brain fog
  idk its kinda extreme so i figure not a lot of people have tried it but it is exactly what the op was asking for so i figure its relevant anyways
    funnily enough the image has already been posted right above the post you replied to
  it takes a choice choice takes willpower
        24 hour dopamine fast  then wake up the next day with proper habits
     i only eat meat       enjoy your colon cancer
  thx this is a good summary
  i spent 8 hours on amazon last night and found 500 i would like to read without even trying
  i spent 8 hours on amazon last night and found 500 i would like to read without even trying    work on your priorities sounds like you want everything at once
  sounds like adhd to me get tested asp
  haha i bet you cant even finish a single one
   amazon  buy used you faggot   also this 
  
i simply removed myself from facebook twitter and reddit then put phone and computer on priority alerts only forever
  i only eat meat  youre going to die       you can also eat only one meal a day  why would you do this
  so long as you dont eat a lot of sugar during the meal one meal a day eating makes you feel super good the fasting is super nice
  i can tell by your enthusiasm to read 500 random books that youve read less than 100 books in your whole life   as someone who used to read 80100 books a year ms and hs stop this shit 90 of books are crap please tell me why you want to do this and what types of books you want to read so badly
  i know some people enjoy intermittent fasting but you will die of a vitamin deficiency if you dont eat fruits and veggies
  literally a secular hajj
  this    browser extensions and such tools are the best way to deal with this in my opinion     i highly recommend a chrome extension called distraction free youtube  basically you can hide everything you want and and only be able to search for and watch videos no recommended feeds trending feeds related videos on the side or at the end of every video or even comments its so good    last summer i started to use the extension and also slowly deleted/blocked all social media apps in my phone and i had never felt so relaxed and calm in a long long time     picked up reading books again after 2 years after realizing how much more free time i had
  im in the same predicament i ignore most power struggles and am incredibly detached if i dominant someone its generally because im simply superior and doing my own deal this is the core of my battle with other people and other structures if i see something being done wrong i fix it if i need to gain control of other people it usually doesnt happen im not a leader and though historically people leaned on me heavily and rallied behind me thats a thing of the past    im bad at direct competition and maintaining interest and energy in power games in fact the perception of direct competition or externally imposed demand causes my output to change or decrease    i can only imagine this trait will make forming a relationship with an attractive woman highly unlikely after high school women dont pursue unless youre part of a group or local social ecology and all those dynamics which im not and never will be
  more like do no habits but those essential for survival and after a while slowly introduce only the positive habits back into your life  your reward center will accommodate to the new norm and the end result will be that you are a more successful person with less compulsion towards the poor habits
  who are you and why are you me about 3 months ago
  k so can someone tell me what the fuck a mood exactly is
  what changed
  left my home town to a good college met some good friends and applied what i knew about not being autistic now im trying for a girlfriend and grinded 2 months of physics in 3 nights not to mention the constant development  what changed was how i go about my social image
  the reason we eat 3 times a day is cultural not biological it would be hard at first but once you got into the habit one meal a day is perfectly healthy
these are some of the most genuine replies for the most part it has really calmed my nerves on 4chan and that wasnt even the point of coming hereglad i stumbled upon this thread hope everyone is striving towards their respective goals and reaching the top of their fields what ever they may be lets fucking gooooo
  gotta agree very comfy thread
  ive been on 2mad small lunch at work  dinner no snacking so long i cant even eat breakfast anymore
  not him but amazon is useful if you just want to check out some reviews or look at recommended books even if you know youre ultimately gonna pirate  buying  lmfao
how the fuck do people manage to focus on one thing    in my head its like several ideas are trying to come through so a congestion happens and instead i do nothing    like i will be thinking hmm i want to learn some medieval history i always wanted to read the bible i want to learn some art history this book on psychology looks interesting i want to learn about the history of the samurai architecture interests me these popsci articles on biology look interesting learning finance might be useful i want to learn how to play fighting games in depth this self help book has a lot of good reviews robotics looks like something fun to get into i really want to try out some vr games man i really feel like playing some obscure retro games i have yet to read all these classic novels i should read up on nutrition i should learn how to cook i feel like learning in depth about japanese pottery i should read some books on cinema so i can appreciate movies more    i feel so overwhelmed that i default to browsing imageboards playing some mindless multiplayer fps or rewatching sitcoms just to keep my mind empty    everything seems like it has potential to be very interesting to learn in depth but you can only focus on a few things how do you decide i feel like if i focus on one thing i miss out on something else when i get myself to read about one thing my mind jumps to something else
  at least moderately intelligent  stopped right there  if thats your assumption for the rest of the post the whole thing is falsehood and a waste of time
  be careful if you are doing this because it can be extremely dangerous for your mental health i tried something similar 2 years when i wanted to deprogram myself in order to get rid of bad habits and then reprogram with good habits i ended up not knowing what i wanted what i liked what i was afraid of why i was living what defined my existence i became completely apathetic to everything wasted large amounts of money and time in things that didnt bring me satisfaction i had absolutely no drive to do anything not even the things i used to like i thought about every action i was doing like i was in manual instead of automatic and going through the day felt like a nightmare i could barely write coherent sentences my body was affected too i felt constantly weak and i gained a lot of fat my skin quality went down a lot too the only thing i was feeling was my brain burning and my body constantly feeling at unease at the worst part i was on the verge of total personality collapse and i had to manually recreate the routine i had before to heal slowly now i would say im 90 back to who i was before im not combating my bad habits by finding substitutes this has been the most horrible thing ive went through and im pretty sure nothing in my life will ever compare to that unspeakable horror it was pure pain and this is something i do not wish on anyone not even my worst enemy i endured my father dying i endured bulling and loneliness at school i endured several breakups i endured a car accident but this this is something i could not endure so i understand perfectly you guys want to get red of bad habits but seriously avoid avoid touching your brain structure because that thing is no joke and i know a lot of anons would have killed themselves at least a dozen times if they went down the same path do not do this
    hey people that are into the things they are interested dont need to focus and being selfdisciplined for them is just a hobby     i will take this with a grain of salt
  dude that whole image is basically change your environment and remove negative influencers its not some mkultra selfdeprogramming routine  if you spend all your time inside on the internet spend 7 days staying away from your house by finding things to do or remove your internet if you have no real self control ive done this in the past
  i did all that stuff and even more though i really dont know what went wrong tbqh i never did drugs i dont smoke and i barely drinked that shit was insane
    trips convinced me to give this a try bc why not     i will post the results and a little log in /adv/ to keep things on topic though
  aspiring scientist  i actually want money so im doing a health course that relies on nothing more than experience and rote memorization
  there are grad schools worth going to that will accept you do well on the gre and apply to dutch schools they are very liberal with who they accept and are good schools or go do a cert at the harvard extension school or a grad dip at the lse or university of london just stop thinking you deserve to do some fancy degree at mit or ethz it sounds like you also have an ego issue and are upset because you think you deserve to go to some amazing grad school or have a highly competitive job most people have way more respect for stem students who try hard regardless of ability and go to the best school they can get into even if its some midtier state school than someone who may have a higher iq but is a child emotionally
  focus on one thing only    tunnel visioning on one thing sacrificing everything else makes you successful    so basically be autistic
  i have the exact same struggle you literally just described how i feel every day i try to fight it and pick and focus on one thing but find it highly diffficult any advice
  so many directions i feel so pulled apart so many distractions i feel them split my heart    which i why im sitting here refreshing paralyzed in motion
  tell me one nutritional deficiency you would have eating only beef and beef liver occasionally
  take up meditating every day sit down close your eyes for 15 minutes and focus on your breathing increase by 5 minutes until youre at an hour every week 15 minutes is nothing but you will notice your focus improving after just a week    i would also suggest some exercise after the meditation for at least 20 minutes exercise of only 20 minutes has been shown to improve your mood and focus and reduce brain fog throughout the entire day     like i said above you can take up a carnivore diet i dont think the diet directly helped my focus but it did make me feel rested after less sleep about 55 hours made me lose weight and cleared up my mild acne all of which improved my state of mind tremendously
  i didnt say anything like your greentext faggot i said the people who are the top achievers have a disposition where there they start suffocating if time is passing without them working on achieving success
i hate studying/working but i also hate being a useless neet or mediocre human being what the fuck is wrong with my brain
    you should try meditating cause your mental shit sounds fucked up    theres some teaching in buddhism that goes discard your opinion of yourself because it matters the least the only person who is gonna ask you how you think of yourself is a therapist so it really doesnt matter
  your hate is overwhelming your determination to do something about it
    most likely a consequence of a lack of direction or purpose you need to have a life goal  something you care about then youll start prioritizing the information important to your plans also may stem from ego and the need to be perfect and know a little bit of everything accept the fact that everyone is always more naive than they think focus on your niche do the rest during free time and surround yourself with a good team to learn from and to compensate for your weaknesses
  smoke weed    i find it helpful when the sleep deprivation kicks when youre so burnt out and the thought of just calling it a night begins to detriment your productivity    the way i see it yes youre not at peak concentration while high but the vasodilation wakes you up and it perks your enthusaim towards another 2 hours of studying before calling it a nightas long as one abates getting derailed
  i hate studying/working but i also hate being a useless neet or mediocre human being    woah just like literally everybody you worthless retard
  thats pretty hurtful
  i kind of had the same experience but ultimately i think it was good that ego death experience you describe made me realize i have a severe personality deficiency if not a full blown personality disorder gaining awareness of it is allowing me to slowly take steps towards improving it
  im sorry if it offended you but i just wanted to bring you back to reality none of us want to be mediocre every single human being on the planet has ambitions passions and dreams of his own yet despite this our own inherent laziness dooms us to suffer from our inability to achieve our dreams     one of my favorite quotes of all time from napoleon     we are made weak both by idleness and distrust of ourselves unfortunate indeed is he who suffers from both if he is a mere individual he becomes nothing if he is a king he is lost    being lazy idleness and having expectations beyond ones capacity distrust of self is a recipe for disaster its how you become no one who was napoleon he just just another commoner not even born on the french mainland yet it took him little time to become emperor of france and the greatest european conqueror since charlemagne himself since 1000 years ago idleness and distrust of yourself are your two greatest enemies
  most likely a consequence of a lack of direction or purpose you need to have a life goal  something you care about then youll start prioritizing the information important to your plans    well thats the problem   but how do you find direction or purpose
actually better advice is to jackoff then eat your cum it is proven to be 900 effective in case studies on mens health
  i believe this is true as well i noticed it a few years ago when i saw my fat body in its worst form at my heaviest just out of the shower it was like an immediate switch  i needed to lose weight for at least 8 months after that moment weight loss was the dominant thought in my head and i did everything right to lose the weight probably overkill on exercise no cheatfood at all and it was all extremely easy my previous attempts at weight loss felt like an exercise in discipline but this time was different there was something driving me and it wasnt willpower    now i believe that all great successes come from some kind of drive that is much more than discipline discipline is something you have to always stay conscious of and your mind is always screaming at you to take the easy way no one can realize their full potential through just discipline     the question i have now is how can we recreat the driving possession that finally made me lose weight but use it to help in other areas of life the more i think about it the more it seems that there needs to be some kind of discomfort a discomfort so great that it lights a fire under your ass for myself i feel like i need to hit a new low in life in order to push myself forward where im at right now is too comfortable and there isnt enough incentive to strive    so how does one hit lows that are low enough to create motivation but not low enough to ruin your livelihood or relationships and is searching for new lows even healthy someone please respond with their thoughts on this theory its been on my mind for a while and i cant really discuss it with people in real life
  i know exactly that thought process i was just thinking about this the other day as i was in my childhood room i think there is something to the comparison of searching for lows and searching for highs yeah maybe lows are what give you that drive but should we be trying to really just maximize that seems to me we should learn how to ride that wave when it comes  no force at all just effort
  seeking lows  i think youre onto something anon
  i also hate being a useless neet or mediocre human being  no you dont stop lying to yourself search your feelings you want to hate it but you dont or you would just start working prove me wrong
  people always act in accordance with their feelings  people cant have contradictory feelings  those are some pretty big assumptions to make
  i used to have this exact problem i solved it only in the last year the key is to reign that stuff in you have limited time and nowadays when i get those ideas i simply think whether i have enough time to do them since i started uni i dont i still get those urges i just dont act on them    at first it was scary because i thought id lose my innate interest in most things but i havent also i had to face the truth that even though i was interested in all these topics i never got anywhere with them
buy dumbphone  leave smartphone at home  go to library or university to study   avoid using laptop whenever possible due to distractions  get shit done as fast as possible  go home  procrastinate until tomorrow
  but use it to help in other areas of life  ive found the key is to really enjoy that process eg weight loss in and of itself that is a driver discipline does not last long if you are completely averse to the task
downgrade your shit  
  then only compete against yourself strive to be a better man than you were yesterday each day improve
  youre literally typing this on 4chan where do you see yourself in your analogy
  this is a bigger community than you think
  im a coasting underachiever who has met high achievers
    i personally think that a 24 hour fast is not enough based on what i lived when i did a water fast for 7 days to reduce my sugar addiction one week was enough to cut my intense cravings but i still wanted to eat sugar so if 7 days was not enough for a simple drug like sugar i think that 24 hours would not be enough at all for anyone trying to reduce their problems coming from multiple addictions my plan is to fast for 714 days while applying the dopamine abstinence i will only read write do some mathematics and exercise after 2 days of pure boredom my goal is to make myself enjoy reading more and work better i will post about this when i get the results
  humans always ate three meals a day before industrialization
    also i dont know what the fuck you mean by analogy its a direct description of the fact that there are people out there who if they get tempted to waste time doing something that doesnt further their development immediately get a vision of someone competing for their same position in life who has the same knowledge skills and aptitude as them but at that moment is not wasting time but feverishly working at the dream they immediately think i need to smash that person im the one not them and they work other people like me and op dont think of that undeniably this is either because we have a secret delusion that well just get there anyway somehow or because we secretly dont really care if we get there we are type b personalities if people need me ill join in i guess assuming we are like the type a people described
  i still eat my fruits and veggies i have an apple an avocado and a salad for breakfast around 3 pm usually then i eat a big healthy dinner with meat at 6 pm then i fast the rest of the time
  having said that there are some possibilities as other people in the thread have offered to kind of be forced into acting type a by circumstance or even tricked into it by mere context encountering high achieving women in school made me feel inadequate so i became competitive for a decade i convinced myself that i was driven until i started slacking again and recognised id just been pretending but the fact is while i was acting as a competitive person i did accomplish the things a competitive person does lmao
  are you even getting restricted calories with all that food
  meditate
  im convinced that some people are just harder workers than others and that conscientiousness is an inherent trait like iq people who are low in it will constantly wonder how theyre going to make themselves work while those high in it will just tell you to get over it or shitpost because they never had the problem in the first place
  anecdotally as an adolescent i was pretty mediocre academically partly due to a complete disinterest in school but by high school i shaped up nowadays im struggling to regain the habits i built in high school
  in that adoption study parents ware not instructed how to behave to niggers and whites and even school hasnt been nothing cut out the enviromental factor    also with same genes your brain can develop different at early stages due to some mediator being present        also focus comes with interest naturally if you have to force yourself its not stuff for you find something different
  check if you doesnt suffer from dopamine deficiency
  is this even english the only part i can follow is   also focus comes with interest naturally if you have to force yourself its not stuff for you find something different  which is the kind of shit idea that leads to ruin because making a living from anything even your passion still involves boring parts and if youre too unconscientious yes it is an innate personality trait once youre an adult nature or nurture irrelevant thats pretty fundamental and hard to change you wont want to do those and youll keep looking for something thats exciting all the time which doesnt exist
  this people have always said to me oh youre so smart must be easy for you meanwhile people who can focus leave me in the dust im flat out amazed at anyone who can concentrate on any task for 8 hours
  no it doesnt involves casting random focus
  please dont post until you have learned better english
  can you state in syntactical and speech act analysis what is wrong with my english
  no because i cant even guess what you were meaning to write this is not the place go buy some sessions with a tutor take your meds too
  track your time google pomodoro and skip the long breaks
  you look stupid stop it
  i dont have the attention span to read this am i still gonna make it bros
    move all your personal belongings that define you outside of your room  meal prep for 7 days worth of food  put away electronics including your phone  spend the next 7 days mostly in your room  doing nothing but reading intellectual books and meditating     the idea is to reset your pleasure receptors in your brain deprive them of signals then at the end of the 7 days you do the things youve wanted or been meaning to and youll get pleasure from doing it coding playing instruments going on hikes reading etc    i did this and it really did leave an impact i enjoyed programming and no longer had a desire to play vidya or binge read manga i fell back into playing vidya tho when a friend came over a week laterim going to try and do it again
      what area do the people you meet work in is it business education or something else i hear about these hard working people all the time but it feels like theyre some unknown group of people out there and all we know about them is some vauge statements
  the people im thinking of are a few doctors/surgeons a lawyer a professor a head of school as in school of math within a university a political advisor turned commentator even in sleepy laid back countries there are people doing things with relative intensity
one of the dopamine fast plans in this thread says you should only do x things which includes reading the other one the video says no reading i think unless reading is something you hate and want to get better at you should avoid reading because thats a very pleasing activity once you get on a roll
  why is a doctor or surgeon trying to work hard by being the best as long as youre good at your job what need is there to work hard and fear the other person in the world who might be working when youre resting if it was business then that would make sense to increase profits and with being a lawyer is very competitive but how is being head of school or commentator require you to work harder than your competitors whats the end goal
ive had good luck journaling identifying problems causes and treatments     i aim for incremental goals and daily note the successes and failures reduce the negative problem causing behaviors gradually increase the treatments gradually and make reflection on these things a daily habit
  you idiot if you dont work that hard you dont get that job someone else does it doesnt mean you have to work harder by cutting into the patient really fast or something it means studying the newest techniques while youre not cutting etc you start as a junior and if you develop your skill and technique you become the senior/head surgeon if you coast like your fucking stupid ass recommends you stay at the same level and you get fired because you arent up to date on procedures  you are right that there are jobs that are not as competitive as others    of course you dont have to be a type a killer to have a job at all i am just saying that people who arent that driven should stop beating themselves up about not working as hard as that people who fucking hate going to bed because it means they have to stop working
i have no self control so i blocked youtube by adding it to my windows host file and disabling it on my phone i would always stay up past midnight mindlessly watching youtube if i had not blocked
  can you give more examples of hard working people youve met and what their working habits are like i like hearing about these people theyre very interesting
im not the best on the subject and i am just starting on this so disregard my advice if you want  i began writing down goals for the next day every day at night at first i couldnt meet those goals because they were far too much for me those experiences helped me identify my own current limits and come up with more realistic and concrete goals   i decided not to be too hard on myself either i was making a genuine effort to improve so there was no point on being harsh on myself just because i wasnt doing everything perfectly my reasoning was that slow steady progress was much better than nothing at all ideally you would get fast and steady progress but i preferred to settle for something that seemed more doable   my daily goals right now are simple stuff like read the chapter on joint distributions or finish those proofs in linear algebra i spend around 68 hours a day on them and get to fuck around for 34 hours at night if i managed to meet the goals of the day i think that when you are just starting it is important not to give up those kind of things entirely social media and youtube in your case but to make sure that you are doing them after all your other duties you need to reward yourself after having worked harder than usual with moderation even if some anons will say otherwise   working on those daily goals has become part of my routine i get out of bed take a shower eat breakfast and get to work on the first goal that is on my list the list is on my phone which is usually the hardest i keep working on those goals and finish all those tasks at about 600 pm i check my mail plan the next day and get to do whatever the fuck i want before 1000 pm which is when i go to sleep making these things a routine is pretty important too i think    you have to continually improve look for ways to be more productive and think of longerterm goals too i cant say anymore because this is already pretty long and looks like a blog post
quality thread this is
  their habits  well my thesis in this thread is that personality or temperament is key habits being downstream of that though ive since moderated it to  personality beliefs circumstances context  in approximate order there of least to most mutable    examples  the political commentator a person from my school has had three careers that each on their own would make a notable life their personality is tracy flicks this person is on tv all the time talking blahdy blah society this moral imperative that but personally they are a success obsessed cutthroat with no real beliefs a person with a similar but not quite the same overachiever personality is a surgeon this person says things like   in my final year at uni i saw my friend who studies computer science doing their project and i thought lol i could do that so much better so i thought it would be a fun challenge to see if i could do their assignment in a day and still do my own assignments and still get top marks   dont get this confused with procrastination this person augmented their workload to add challenge so that they could show off to themselves how capable they are they essentially get cummies off being the best  the more challenge there is the more they can get off this person is only in medicine and particularly their chosen speciality because it was the hardest career they could think of     make what you will of the fact these are both women and both vaguely/partly from cultural backgrounds where status is a thing that people actually give a shit about
    someone who did not have overacheiver personality but does their unending work because of beliefs and perhaps context is a family member who was a doctor and served their area as the only doctor for something like 30 more years than the retirement age of my country several after the life expectancy in fact and i believe this is mostly due to protestant work ethic in this age its kind of hard to imagine someone having a genuine ethical belief they act on let alone one that idleness is unethical but i think that was the case also because having taken up the responsiblity circumstance there wasnt someone else around who could do things that needed to be done and that probably made this person step up i dont think they loved the work or the patients enough that they were doing it for of pleasure when another doctor was finally hired and they could finally stop this person said they never after had a single thought related to medical practice its like i never did it despite being an example to everyone around of an extremely diligent worker this person has expressed lament and perhaps jealousy that for example churchill wrote a series of history books in a month or thereabouts while being the prime minister of a nation at war and this person hadnt written any books yet     this is why when some faggot on here says but i hate the idea of not being useful i dont believe you you are not like this yes people can have contradictory actions and beliefs if theres something else getting in the way usually fear but equally likely that your belief is a sham and wouldnt hold under any actual test this is probably down to the fact that because you dont move in the world and among people there is no one to laugh at you for that imagine someone you regard  he says its wrong to waste time but he does exactly that lmao
  i keep shitposting on /sci/ and i dont know how to stop /sci/ has become my addiction  anyone knows how i can break this addiction pattern
  and i just want to add a little anecdote there was a car race thing i was at and the driver would always come second which was impressive but he got really bad times on time trials he said i need someone to chase this was why he always came second too if he got into the lead he would just start daydreaming and take his foot off the pedal i think the achiever psychos i mentioned are different not just in personality but that they had a specific visions i want this exact job and i know i need to do this now today if im going to be the one that gets it others have a vision like i guess id like to be a scientist after i graduate youre doing the time trial
  fuck the normies go on like christopher langan
  just turn off your eletronics brah
      fuck i wanna be like this but cant the situation i live in at the moment wont allow it i live in a 3 bedroom house thats really 2 bed i sleep in a mini room that i share with my brother i have no space to work no time to learn and just a bunch of mental issues that have caused me to act as such    is there any way i can become a workaholic like this i already have a purpose but just cant execute the actions in order to achieve my goal    its a sad life huh
  if you were one of those people you would probably work around your obstacles   its a sad life huh  cringe you wrote these excuses why you wont make your goal the fact you know you wont achieve it means it is not a goal it is a fantasy thats the difference
  you might very well have adhd dude that sounds exactly like how i was before i was medicated on 20mg adderall xr
  so how long did the effects of your selfdeprivation last sounds like just a week which makes going a week like that unworthy
  i started sucking dicks
  its easy to deny until you actually meet somebody who is highly successful upon which it immediately becomes clear that they are a different type of person to you    id say this is just world fallacy at its finest you think that people who work very very hard toward their goal succeed theres plenty of people who happen to hate whatever field they work in but they just happen to be highly gifted in the particular set of skills that are required its very romantic to think that people that are successful in something are completely engulfed in/in love with what they do
  completely engulfed in/in love with what they do  not what i was saying read the rest of the thread
  it takes 50 days to 3 months to form a habit
  this person is only in medicine and particularly their chosen speciality because it was the hardest career they could think of   in other words the person you describe is not as bright as you imply in comparison with mathematics or physics medicine is very simple and straightforward
   its very romantic to think that people that are successful in something are completely engulfed in/in love with what they do  in academia its a fact for people employed in any other area of the workforce it may sometimes be an unreasonable assumption
  oh my god shut uppppp this thread is about being motivated and disciplined not a fucking iq competition do you ever give it a rest
    so im at iq  150 but that does not mean shit unless its actually used on top of that with high iq comes boredom etc and hence a propensity to hop around various things    the need for building discipline is something that takes time and conscious effort i think in many ways its like going to the gym  one does not follow schedule unless some noticeable change is seen and even then one has to build a sense of discomfort when schedule is interrupted    one of the first things i personally did was delete most social feeds especially the ones that needed accounts for eg facebook where my posts are linked to my name make me feel a certain anxiety as if i were responsible of explaining and responding to everyone who interacted with content i generated whereas reddit is fine    surround yourself with the topic of interest not just study it eg if reading neurosci observe behavior and recollect and associate neurosci concepts with them while doing group theory watch tiling patterns and try to fit them into group structures while doing deep learning try to fit situations in life into high dimensional optimization spaces etc etc    have at least two topics and juggle if you need to you will get bored doing only one and would need to give yourself some time for stuff to sink in    constantly keep reminding yourself of stuff you __have__ to do to the point that you find yourself doing it just to shut yourself up
  you will realize that after a while you will be reading the same information again and again go look at a subfield a lot of books reference other books and summarize the important points on a particular matter
my parents pushed me into uni straight out of high school i was always an absolute shit student who got good grades    in university these shitty habits eventually caught up to me and i dropped out in my last year i took 23 years off at a shitty restaurant job focusing on music of all things    it took me those 7 years to finally get a deep intrinsic focus and determination to make something better of myself im going into computer science next year and i dont need a course to tell me to study im studying before school has even started because i see the bigger picture i am also motivated by the fact that i want to start a family and want to be a solid foundation for my girlfriend being a parasite sucks    basically at some point you become so sick of being a lowlife that you just do it it feels good to get a coffee and study because i know where its taking me sidenote i had to quit 100 weed and video games to get to this stage
are math proofs like logic proofs im currently in a logic class and am studying proofs might be my favorite part of logic yet    are advance level math proofs anything like logic proofs last time i did math proofs was in like 10th grade and we had to write them in paragraph form
  no  logic seeks nuanced proofs  math seeks powerful and efficient proofs
  lol what are you even saying
  they can be  
  no the idea of proof is communicate an idea too much formalism can obfuscate that source grad student in mathematical logic
  a math proof is not about autistically proving something is true although that is a result its mostly about communicating how some concepts relate to one another    geometric arguments words and graphs are usually included to make the understanding easier
  yes it happens a lot especially in coq
i love reading classical philosophy texts both western and eastern and came to really appreciate symbolic logic in college i otherwise suck at math    is there a book about higher order math that can help me better understand the universe but easy enough for a newb like me to figure out
  physics is based on math which is based on symbolic logic
  id like a suggestion for a book on higher math so i can continue learning about the nature of things
  i have some lions man in my fridge should eat
  physics 101 logic and math are simply products of the mind they are abstract tools we use to measure things the nature of things is tge phenomenal world
  maybe the shape of inner space  feynmans lectures of physics   a universe from nothing
  
ill start    dude like they should get rid of tests it only gives us anxiety and doesnt actually show how well we learn something
just because i suck at maths doesnt mean im stupid
  i think a lot of people who believe they are bad at math are actually just miserable with the bizarre memorization practices of us primary education
  when are we ever going to use this  bonus points if said in a college class specific to their major
i actually learn more because of tests i can understand the concepts through classes/books/online but studying for a graded test burns everything to the memory
maths
ignores obvious deficiencies of donald trump and parrots obvious propaganda alluding to his supposed virtues
  was talking to a friend in physics earlier today and he said the exact same thing about fucking undergrad level physics pathetic    cringe
  itt things brainlets say
my friend once said before a physicss test when i was 16 i think newtons third law will be disproven one day how is it possible for something to hit you if its not moving   he failed the test
  not signing up for pure math just to harass professors with this
  hilarious image  only one thatd be funnier to do this in would be philosophy or the arts
  gotem
  this is true
as my man sam o nella said   most people believe einstein was an highschool dropout reality is that he mastered both differential and integral calculus by the age of 15  i failed the test well at least im still on par with famous scientist insert name here
  questions that were intentionally dumbed down so that you could solve all of them in  3 hours are the true way to prove your knowledge  i wont say that its useless but the god tier classes are ones that forgo tests and instead choose to issue 3 or 4 actually tough problem sets that actually challenge you to read more collaborate and think
  except that newtons third law doesnt always apply eg electromagnetism
  this shit and other general complaints about the classes i swear people find the stupidest shit to blame
  wtf are you talking about it still applies
  most people innately know math just lacking formalism the stupidity is in just not accepting that they never learned    for example look at the famous renormalization its fucking simple incredibly simple look at logarithms theyre present all throughout nature and something most people intuitively understand yet it took some guy high on reality looking at horsetail to formalize it
  so you are the   poster from the other thread cringe
  take an electrodynamics class
  wooowe gotem good
  can someone answer this unironically
  in your math related job
  an highschool
anyone who defends or enjoys school in any way is a mental midget anyone who wants a career or a normal life
are you guys sure that math isnt just a really bad meme used to only see if you are actually paying any attention to what you are being taught
  lol well points are just a fiction that are used to make some mathematical sophisms
  math isnt just a really bad meme  lrn2meme fgt pls
  you might be retarded
  points are useful approximations for teaching basic processes occurring in the real world they dont actually exist unless you consider an area of 1 planck length squared to be a point but theyre good enough
  mathematics is the universe mofo
    yes points that have an area dimensional value the point being  mathematical points have absolutely effing nothing to do with that by definition
    i might be but can you see yourself that this kind of a task is absolutely not allowed in terms of the definition of the mathematical point   by freaking definition or did i misunderstand the definition of the mathematical point     oh please accept everything you are being thrown at by random people with their absurd ridiculous definitions and that they break when they cant get around them
  you misunderstood the definition of the mathematical point
    the geometric points do not have any length area volume or any other dimensional attribute     i took this from wikipedia do you claim its wrong in accurate
  absurd ridiculous definitions  just because you dont understand doesnt make it absurd or ridiculous
  looks like someone never learned measure theory
  the planck distance is only the limit of proper distances you can still have coordinate distances smaller than it such as the wavelength of light since this is observer dependant   in other words spacetime is continuous and made of zerovolume points
/sci/ the smart board  cant determine whether an arbitrary finite simplicial complex is homeomorphic to a manifold
  your making mistake assuming /sci/ is smart
  hey i know some of those words
  there are theorems for specific cases but an arbitrary one id like to see you try
  it is not to be homeomorphic in a manifold it must be cohesive and therefore the arbitrarial nature of it would at some points result in failure     o
  it fails for n cases   then it fails for all cases   this is your brain on induction
  i hate to play semantics here but you phrased the question in such a way that the comparison between the two abstractions in question were to be framed in absolutes ergo my previous statement still stands and i will be taking my waifu and leaving
/sci/  the smart board
    come to /sci/ they said  come to watch qt anime girls btfo of each other they said  it will be fun they said    seriously why do you guys even bother doing this its been like this since rei and asuka give it a rest its been like nearly half a century    0_0
  this op is a brainlet
  0_0  
  nearly a century    waifu wars have been around since at the very least the grecopersian wars
  you are a horrifically intelligent mother fucker why do you bother hanging out here with these losers
i have two weeks to master algebra whats the best way i will buy any udemy course
khan academy
  this
  middle school
letters can be any number and you can do operations on them  saved you a udemy course
  slow paced as fuck but best
  what do you mean by algebra do you mean the basics of arithmetic equality and systems of equations or do you mean rings groups fields etc
  im going to assume that you already have a practical competence with college algebra because otherwise youd be underage the key is to find a good learning resource textbook open courseware khan academy etc next you skim through to list each major result stand in front of a chalkboard for hours at a time and convince yourself that the results should be true you should be doing this both ways ie demonstrate the result by manipulating the equations as well as convince yourself visually and intuitively you should be able to visualize in your head each major result as a process this is the only way to build a solid foundation in the span of two weeks
  this        either of you going the completionist route i started at counting and now im 62 finished with all of the math
  i refuse to learn from a poojeet
  are you serious the dude is more than a great teacher for lower level mathematics i used his videos alongside my own tutoring to help my little brother out with math
  
professor leonards intermediate algebra playlist played at 15x speed
get a problems book with solutions and go chapter by chapter
  his teaching style really irritates me if i was op id rather learn from a textbook and watch youtube videos
p aluffi algebra chapter 0
spent easily 60 hours doing practice problems to master intermediate algebra
  this he just keeps repeating stuff like a fucking parrot i gave up on him and read the textbooks instead
n jacobson basic algebra i
  eulers elements of algebra
    the textbook route is superior to youtube youre not learning anything if youre not doing proofs and exercises youtube should just be utilized for difficult to cross gaps between concepts where you are unsure of the concept itself not for learning operations/algorithms or mathematical reasoning
  can you elaborate on what you mean by algebra
  this  itll take more than 2wk tho
    this course actually is from the sticky post i started it recently and its pretty good do a chapter in 1 or 2 days and you will be done in two weeks at most
  read the following links and all of the sublinks and youll basically cover almost every topic of abstract algebra in proofwiki  beginning with group theory  math  beginaligned  textgroup theory  textpgroups  text  text  textorder of groups  text  text  textsymmetric groups  text  textquotient groups  text  text  textsolvable groups  text  text  text  textfeitthompson theorem  textorthogonal groups  text  textsemidirect products  text  textnormal subgroups  text  textrepresentation theory  text  textmiscellaneous  text  text  endaligned  /math

  none of these contain the other or is contained by the other therefore this is probably the shortest path to cover almost all abstract algebra links
  this
  wow and yet its not even close to being a complete list i guess people generally fail to realize that algebra is not the arithmetic they did in high school
work your way through this pdf you should be able to do it in 2 weeks    
   though you know actually its pretty close to being complete but its just that all the important information is not just contained on the surface but also contained within sublinks of sublinks of sublinks lol this took me all night im a human web crawler hehe though sure ideal theory lacks quite a bit
  the key to getting math is to make up problems in your head then solve them you should be able to do this by reflex
  stay away from courses learn the theory from a textbook solve the problems watch the videos of a topic youre having trouble with
    oh man i did not mean to criticize your effort though i mightve framed that sentence like an idiot much    what i actually meant is that the field is huge 2 weeks of study would probably not be enough by a long shot id probably look at a time frame of around 24 years at least
  but even then it points to thousands of links who knows how much it would take to understand those few articles and of course proofwiki doesnt include the whole of abstract algebra
you dont need fucking textbooks and proofs for algebra its all self evident khan academy with videos on 2x speed is literally the best way
  all you need to know is how to multiply to algebraic expressions the rest just follows from that

what does sci think of him
  hes damn good at chess but i dont see him becoming a real celebrity later in life like kasparov did
not science or math
turbo autism
  impressive dude but he probably still gets just as pisses as me playing vs computers
  i suck at chess
autism
he seems to have less hype about him nowadays is this because he is no longer the young new kid or is he less dominant
  great hair
  
  smart guy what more to say    chess is like maths as in theres rules that cant be bent and theres many formulas to winning aka achieving check mate aka solving the problem
  chess is like maths
  less dominant but is still the best in the world in classic rapid and blitz
is there someone who knows something about drum filters any help will be appreciated thanks in advance
     not able to simply use the units of the given variables to solve for the diameter    imagine being such a brainlet
what exactly is math and numbers is it some abstract concept we use to define reality like language is it a priori or a posteriori is it metaphysical what exactly is it
    im just a novice but when i started relearning math it was clear that it was a language with specific words and letters that have a specific meaning and you have to fallow gramatical rules to form meaninful sentences etc i think there is a posibility as any other language of doing metaphysics for example when working with infinits   but im just a novice the fuck do i know

  its a priori
the fact is there has been global warming but the contribution of humangenerated carbon dioxide  is necessarily so minuscule as to be nearly undetectable heres why    carbon dioxide considered the main vector for humancaused global warming is some 0039 of the  atmosphere1 a trace gas water vapor varies from 0 to 42 and should easily average 1 or   more3 near the earths surface where the greenhouse effect would be most important and is about  three times more effective4 a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide so water vapor is at least   25 times more prevalent and three times more effective that makes it at least 75 times more important  to the greenhouse effect than carbon dioxide5 the total contribution of carbon dioxide to the   greenhouse effect is therefore 0013 or less   the total human contribution to atmospheric carbon dioxide since the start of the industrial revolution  has been estimated at about 256 so humans carbon dioxide greenhouse effect is a quarter of 0013   works out to about 000325 total warming of the earth by the greenhouse effect is widely accepted as  about 33 degrees centigrade raising average temperature to 15 degrees centigrade or 59 degrees fahrenheit  so the contribution of anthropogenic carbon dioxide is less than 02 degrees fahrenheit or under 01 degree  centigrade global warming over the last century is thought by many to be 06 to 08 degrees centigrade
  op continued    but thats only the beginning weve had global warming for more than 10000 years since the end of the last  ice age and there is evidence temperatures were actually somewhat warmer 9000 years ago and again   4500 to 8000 years ago than they are today7 whatever caused that it was not human activity   it was not all those power plants and factories and suvs being operated by stone age cavemen while chipping  arrowheads out of bits of flint whatever the cause was it melted the glaciers that in north america once  extended south to long islan and parts of new york city8 into virtually complete disappearance   except for a few mountain remnants thats one big greenhouse effect if we are still having global   warming  and i suppose we could presume we are given this 10000 year history  it seems highly likely that  it is still the overwhelmingly primary cause of continued warming rather than our piddling 000325 contribution  to the greenhouse effect    yet even that trendcontinuation today needs to be proved evidence is that the medieval warm period centered  on the 1200s was somewhat warmer than we are now9 and the climate was clearly colder in the little ice age  in the 1600s than it is now10 so we are within the range of normal upanddown fluctuations without human   greenhouse contributions that could be significant or even measurable
  op continued    the principal scientists arguing for humancaused global warming have been demonstrably disingenuous11   and now you can see why they have proved they should not be trusted the idea that we should be spending  hundreds of billions of dollars and hamstringing the economy of the entire world to reduce carbon dioxide  emissions is beyond ludicrous in light of the facts above it is insane furthermore it sucks attention   and resources from seeking the other sources of warming and from coping with climate change and its effects  in realistic ways the true motivation underlying the global warming movement is almost certainly ideological  and political in nature and i predict that anthropogenic global warming as currently presented will go down  as the greatest fraud of all time it makes ponzi and madoff look like pikers by comparison

  look guy heres the plan  burn lots of hydrocarbons to bind up existing o2  sequester this now formed co2  pump it deep underground where it will be thoroughly locked away in the name of saving the planet  deindustrialize most of the world as well also to save the planet while also sterilizing and killing off the bulk of the population and leaving the rest as dependent as possible  herd people into megacities via eg un agenda 21  bring about a massive global drop in usable oxygen  make farming near impossible for anyone other than industrial approved farming operations  control people with oxygen availability    alright sounds good lets get those serf cattle under control
  hyperlink      look guy you gotta be fucking kidding me how about you get it together huh
  look guy climate is controlled by solar activity weve known this for quite some time alright
  gotta copy the entire links fucktard
  the things is many people disregard human impact on warming because leaks have shown that some researchers especially at the university of sydney have faked evidence of it to get more research funding
  was your discovery of this info on co2 recent ive been posting several links along these same lines showing the absurdity of the greenhouse gas theory for at least a year now albeit infrequently choosing mainly to reply to the plethora of threads started in staunch support of the agw party line   either way good on you for taking the time to actually consider some alternative scientific media rather than taking onesided propaganda as gospel and shaming those who dont
  what do you think of this      im evaluating every branch and every possibility with every new piece of information
  im retarded  ok
  shut up you dirty weaponized whore
  point proven
    burn lots of hydrocarbons to bind up existing o2  sequester this now formed co2  pump it deep underground where it will be thoroughly locked away in the name of saving the planet  thatll never work in time we need the quick fix  control people with oxygen availability  you might be onto something here  if only there existed a high frequency band capable of disrupting the molecular spin and thus structure of oxygen it could be used to silently choke people by simply inhibiting respiration slowly ramping up the signal strength   boil em slow like 5 frogs in a pot   it would be so clever hohoho
  if only there existed a high frequency band capable of disrupting the molecular spin and thus structure of oxygen it could be used to silently choke people by simply inhibiting respiration slowly ramping up the signal strength  hey i know we could use 60ghz    wait someone already did that its called wigig / wifi 6 darn
  wrong
  you have to go back
burger time  climate change deniers run rampant  eurochads have to show them their place  are you really that stupid my burger friends
  the fuck is your problem do you have to go all paranormal witch hunter every time you read any speculation on /sci/ way to contribute nothing  can we get a based mod to just ban these losers
  carbon dioxide considered the main vector for humancaused global warming is some 0039 of the atmosphere1 a trace gas water vapor varies from 0 to 42 and should easily average 1 or   more3 near the earths surface where the greenhouse effect would be most important and is about three times more effective4 a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide so water vapor is at least   25 times more prevalent and three times more effective that makes it at least 75 times more important to the greenhouse effect than carbon dioxide5   this is all irrelevant the vast majority of the greenhouse effect keeps the earth from being a giant ball of ice its not the vast majority of the greenhouse effect thats the problem its the change in greenhouse gases since the industrial revolution that has rapidly taken us out of the climatic optimum that change is caused entirely by mans emissions your source is feeding you a gigantic red herring
  hey kiddo i see you posted le epic /x/ meemee on /sci/    alright now i need you to pay attention youre on a science board so standards are slightly higher around these parts so what you need to do is go to wwwgooglecom acknowledging subconsciously that google apple and microsoft et al are pure evil while you do so and then you need to look up absorption spectrum of diatomic oxygen for me okay now you need to brush up on your basic chemistry concerning what happens when something is irradiated in such a way and then attempts to bind to another compound oh i dont know like hemoglobin should be a neat little exercise for you    now i need you to look up something you havent heard of before so put on your learning hat or thinking cap if the former is not available i need you to look up wifi 6 or wigig okay now i need you to look up what frequency its set to operate at    gosh i wonder what could go wrong theyre the experts though im sure someone is looking out for me and testing this stuff for safety
  but thats only the beginning weve had global warming for more than 10000 years since the end of the last ice age   this is a lie the end of the last ice age was millions of years ago you mean the end of the last glacial period interglacial warming stopped about 7000 years ago so we havent had global warming since then we were slowly cooling since then until man started rapidly dumping co2 into the atmosphere this source does not deserve any further attention considering how egregious its misrepresentations and outright lies are use your brain next time and have a little skepticism
  speculation  lol 
  saved
  speculation  u wut this shit aint speculation its physical fact how it works we know this shit already theres not much to speculate about beyond why they are doing it why a point near the maximum dielectric loss of water was left as unlicensed spectrum and chosen for wifi why wigig is now going after oxygen as well thats what were speculating about but to imply were speculating about what itll do way too generous      read a book kiddo
  very interesting but did you take a look at

  less post links than me  youre losing ground and i see youre becoming daunted by the strength of my arguments
  should be stickied
  the entire thread is offtopic also 
  debating the scientific merits of the anthropogenic climate change framework is off topic for a science forum where do you think you are /religion/ /dogma/    look kiddo thats all well and good if you have beliefs and live by the faith and all that but i think youre really in the wrong place i also suggest you lay flat and try not to get trampled by the real thinkers in the world while you sit fixed like an inanimate object cycling your crude programming    behavior like that someone could write you in an hour buddy boyo i have an idea  go detach and find yourself
  debating  you dumping mental diarrhea because thats all i see
  thats nice
  how it feels to destroy  posters
what motive would the system have for using wigig for purposes of mass murder
  there are a number of branches which would include this aspect ultimately its all about control and depopulation were already being dumbed down and sterilized death rate is being increased now of course they also want us to be as weak and sick as possible    un has stated they want the global population to be 1 billion georgia guidestones state 500 million who knows the full plan and control structure its irrelevant to how this works anyway
  
    so i was looking through fundamentals of physical geography 2nd edition  by michael pidwirny and i found the following statement    the fifth most abundant gas in the atmosphere is carbon dioxide the volume of this gas has increased by over 35 in the last three hundred years see figure 7a1 this increase is primarily due to human induced burning from fossil fuels deforestation and other forms of landuse change carbon dioxide is an important greenhouse gas the humancaused increase in its concentration in the atmosphere has strengthened the greenhouse effect and has definitely contributed to global warming over the last 100 years carbon dioxide is also naturally exchanged between the atmosphere and life through the processes of photosynthesis and respiration    if youre going to be antisemites and disguise yourselves as scientists you should probably read your own sources before you post them
c02 and temperature track and there hasnt been this much in a long long time
does it even make sense to you to imagine that billions and billions of metric tons of oil could be dug up and set on fire and that somehow that wouldnt have some effect on the atmosphere
  antisemites  everyone go home all possible discussion is now over we are no match for this nonsequiturfu
    you could begin by explaining why you were deliberately misleading with the information you presented if the contribution of humangenerated carbon dioxide  is necessarily so minuscule as to be nearly undetectable then why has it risen by 35 to and quote definitely contributed to global warming over the last 100 years    im not done reading through your sources i think you have some interesting material here and ill keep an open mind but so far it looks like you just cherry picked some data and drew some conclusions on your own
  antisemites  got em
the jews dont want to kill you they just want to make a lot of money and climb the social ladder you want to kill the jews so you invent a boogeyman story to justify your homicidal intent the jew inhabits the same place in your mind that satan inhabits in the mind of a christian a kind of omnipresent puppetmaster who works through others to deceive you and is always out to get you and in whos existence you would never disbelieve regardless of what proof you were shown    everything that you project on to the jew and on to the rest of society is actually coming from inside of yourself all of that ugliness inside projected on to an external tormentor so you can continue to believe yourself a virtuous struggler for truth     the people who are the most unconscious of their own evil are the most dangerous
  the jews are an instrument theyve been used for decades thats why trauma programming and shared sacrifice the mark of the covenant is the core of their religion
  decades  centuries rather where is my mind today
      come on boys dont retreat to your safe spaces and echo chambers so quickly im open to talking to you  and im telling you it took me less than five minutes to find out youve been misrepresenting your source material
    thats interesting and new so whos using the jews as an instrument lucifer himself please say extra dimensional entities because that would freak me out
  loosely the cabal the amorphous them people have plotted out many control structures over the centuries some with persistent elements that remain a solid line through time rothschilds rockefellers monarchies and political dynasty which are all conveniently descended from vlad the impaler etc and others that have a facet come into view for a short time but cant really be tacked down im not really an expert on the finer specifics and id recommend books by eustace mullins but i am quite familiar with their pattern of operation and certain key periods of history as well as the overall agenda thats coming strongly into view at the moment    for trauma programming systematic use of torture and social stimuli to either get the mind to splinter into pieces which are then programmed or as a noncompartmentalized mechanism of strong behavioral control youll have to refer to related literature on trauma and dissociation satanic ritual programming etc mengele mkultra and monarch programming are also good leads    jews are essentially middle management a front a compartmentalized layer between those who are really in control and the broader serfs one side of my family actually has jewish heritage traveled through russia to germany then to france then to canada and interbred with the native americans i think these jew genes though diluted may afford some insight into the jew mind
  also just to tell you im not excluding other species puppeting the human race a species that was here all along aliens big brained hominid or primates with the elongates skulls that those of the vatican could conveniently hide with their hats probably not descendants of the giants though
  why even bother they are larping as people who can digest scientific studies      picked some cherries for you since youve been busy harvesting today its from assessment report 5 by the ipcc in 2015     warming of the climate system is unequivocal and since the 1950s many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia     atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide have increased to levels unprecedented in at least the last 800000 years     human influence on the climate system is clear it is extremely likely 95100 probability that human influence was the dominant cause of global warming between 19512010        ill easily take a very large bet on your prediction its all a widespread fraud and conspiracy by thousands of scientists across the world id gamble my house on it
  climactic optimum
  were already being dumbed down  youre the prime example
  how so
  because youre dumb as shit
  how so
   un has stated they want the global population to be 1 billion  imagine being so fucked in the head that you actually believe this shit
  why they sterilized a bunch of girls in kenya with tetanus vaccines they have the sights on other countries as well using the templates tested in the third world
  warming of the climate system is unequivocal and since the 1950s many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia  millenia relies on an accurate assessment of the average global temperature in the distant past these assessments are controversial     atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide have increased to levels unprecedented in at least the last 800000 years  the op does not necessarily dispute this     human influence on the climate system is clear  but to what extent is not so clear    human influence was the dominant cause of global warming between 19512010  doesnt specify co2    none of these points contradict the ops argument
  
  what about wigig    they chased me around with a pair of scissors for years now im being chased with a noose why anon
  millenia relies on an accurate assessment of the average global temperature in the distant past these assessments are controversial  how are they controversial if anything is controversial its the pseudoscience youre posting    the op does not necessarily dispute this  it attempts to distract from this with irrelevant statistics about the whole atmosphere and the whole greenhouse effect    but to what extent is not so clear  wrong see pic    doesnt specify co2  keep reading    none of these points contradict the ops argument  thats because the ops argument is a red herring
  how are they controversial  climate change tends to involve average global temperature changes of only a few degrees  take this unsourced graph for example    which purports to measure average global temperature over 1000000 years ago to within 1 degree celsius  do you really believe in the accuracy of the temperature curve of this graph   if so please explain your confidence
  oops this link  
  how do you know they arent just racists who want fewer kenyans
  there is no point in your statement 999 of the atmosphere arent greenhouse gases thats like saying drugs cant kill you because its just some grams that cause an overdose how can some grams cause an overdose if my body is almost 100kg amirite
   the fifth most abundant gas in the atmosphere is carbon dioxide  this is not really relevant   what matters is the concentration level   its kind of like when you buy certain juice drinks the real juice is the 3rd most abundant ingredient but 99 of the product is water and corn syrup     the volume of this gas has increased by over 35 in the last three hundred years  true the argument uses 25 instead of 35 which represents just the increase from the modern industrial revolution beginning around 1900 the other 10 if you want to include it doesnt change the basic argument that observed climate change is on the order of 6 to 8 degrees while the expected portion for co2   at a 35 increase is only about 14 c    contributed to global warming over the last 100 years  the op argument does not deny some trace amount of contribution
  op literally has no clue what he is talking about and just copy pasted some wikipedia texts while not understanding them and thinking that 01 of the atmosphere means carbon is irrelevant to the global climate
  the graph if it is representationally accurate enough to be of real use only shows a strong connection to man activity and temp and does not prove that increased c02 emissions are the primary cause of the spike near the end  since much of the graph represents a timeframe before modern meteorological technology some might take issue with it in the first place  look a this graph you are saying you know within 2c what the average global temperature was 200000 years ago   really now
  you need to show a multiplicative effect from the trace amounts of co2 such as was shown with cfcs  the refrigerant flourocarbons and the ozone layer  the relationship seems multiplicative based primarily on the empirical data of the co2 climate change theory itself  the planet venus for example has runaway greenhouse climate but the atmosphere is over  96 co2 and the atmosphere is much denser  over 90 times earth pressure with approximately the same gravity the idea that trace amount increases of c02 gases in earths atmosphere will cause runaway climate change are very doubtful
  copy pasted some wikipedia texts  its worse than that actually he cuntpasted a 20yearold opinion piece by thomas gale moore a fairly wellknown denier who literally shilled for tobacco interests back in the day and now works for the cato institute and the competitive enterprise institute doing much the same thing  
   the vast majority of the greenhouse effect keeps the earth from being a giant ball of ice  this is not true    take are own moon for example which has no atmosphere to speak of the surface temperatures vary from 260f to 280f  as you approach the core the temps increase to an estimated 2500f hardly a ball of ice    so it would be more correct to say the earths greenhouse gases and atmosphere itself stabilize what might otherwise be wide fluctuations in temperature
  doesnt specify co2  keep reading    an experiment has shown that stratospheric water vapor has increased an average of 1 per year over the period from 1980 to 2010 since the experiment began   so co2 is not the only thing changing    
  the humidity changed  this happens constantly all over the world and has since land before time
  the humidity in this one town changed over thirty years carbon taxes now
   the temp changed  this happens all over the world and has since land before time    what is important is the average aggregate effect 1 increase per year is significant the effect seems to be tied to methane somehow but according to the noaa there is uncertainty    some of the midlatitude increase of stratospheric water vapor 1 per year over the period of 19802006 can be explained by the increase of atmospheric methane but not all is this an early indication of the feedback of water vapor in climate change transport or unknown chemistry    
  do you really believe in the accuracy of the temperature curve of this graph   yes why wouldnt i    if so please explain your confidence  
  the graph if it is representationally accurate enough to be of real use only shows a strong connection to man activity and temp and does not prove that increased c02 emissions are the primary cause of the spike near the end  it was not intended to co2 emissions causing warming is proved directly by measuring the spectrum of incoming infrared heat    since much of the graph represents a timeframe before modern meteorological technology some might take issue with it in the first place  those who might take issue with it might not know what theyre talking about    the planet venus for example has runaway greenhouse climate but the atmosphere is over 96 co2 and the atmosphere is much denserover 90 times earth pressure with approximately the same gravity the idea that trace amount increases of c02 gases in earths atmosphere will cause runaway climate change are very doubtful  who said it will result in runaway warming you realize warming does not necessarily mean runaway warming right
  you need to show a multiplicative effect from the trace amounts of co2 such as was shown with cfcs  the refrigerant flourocarbons and the ozone layer  
  lets assume you can with enough ice core samples using oxygen isotope ratios assess to within a fraction of a degree average temperatures 100s of thousands of years ago  which you cant because not all parts of the world were cold enough at the right times for the type of probability sample required but assume you could    how do you explain the tracking of co2 to temperature since there was no industrialization like today how do you know the climate didnt actually drive the environment and that somehow drove the co2 levels    in other words in terms of geological epoch timeframe events the co2 can still be incidental or at least not the cause of the estimated temperature changes
  take are own moon for example which has no atmosphere to speak of  lol without an atmosphere there is nothing to keep water from evaporating and no ice i didnt say earth without an atmosphere i said earth without a greenhouse effect    so it would be more correct to say the earths greenhouse gases and atmosphere itself stabilize what might otherwise be wide fluctuations in temperature  the atmosphere does the greenhouse effect doesnt if anything the feedback effects related to the greenhouse effect destabilize the climate
  it was not intended to co2 emissions causing warming is proved directly by measuring the spectrum of incoming infrared heat  that graph alone does not prove co2 global climate change it describes radiation characteristics of the materials actually on the list although it definitely could be used for a full theory on the matter     who said it will result in runaway warming  some actually have claimed that
  an experiment has shown that stratospheric water vapor has increased an average of 1 per year over the period from 1980 to 2010 since the experiment began   so co2 is not the only thing changing  yeah thats because as the earth warms more water vapor is released from the oceans water vapor is part of a feedback loop not a forcing
  of importance here is that the whole matter could still be mostly independent of co2 in loop
  how do you explain the tracking of co2 to temperature since there was no industrialization like today  milankovich cycles produce warming which initiates the release of co2 and water vapor from the oceans which causes warming which causes more water vapor and co2 to release etc    how do you know the climate didnt actually drive the environment and that somehow drove the co2 levels    it did    in other words in terms of geological epoch timeframe events the co2 can still be incidental or at least not the cause of the estimated temperature changes  its not the initial cause but its effect is necessary to explain the amount of warming
  that graph alone does not prove co2 global climate change  it was not supposed to there are multiple pieces of evidence that need to be put together to get to our current understanding but you keep trying to isolate those pieces and attack a straw man    1 the amount of ghgs we emit    2 the greenhouse effect    3 feedback loops    4 natural forcings    see pic in  for a quantitative summary of the forcings
  some actually have claimed that  who
  of importance here is that the whole matter could still be mostly independent of co2 in loop  which matter
  milankovich cycles produce warming which initiates the release of co2  for the uninitiated  why does the co2 level initially change 
  it seems like if there is a problem with the op argument the error relates to items 3 and 4 of your post    no one seems to have succinctly refuted the op argument
  increase in solar radiation due to a very long cycle in earths orbital eccentricity warms oceans which releases co2
  i refuted it here  and     its simply logically and factually incorrect i dont need to prove agw in some 4chan posts to show that
   which matter  the matter of moisture levels in the stratosphere
  op continued nevermind i sucks cocks
  those two posts havent refuted anything  and most certainly havent refuted the op argument by clearly explaining a contradiction or such   the refutation relies on the main talking points of a theory that even the ipcc itself admits is at a less than perfect 95 confidence level
  that cant be independent of co2 levels since the moisture level is a function of temperature and co2 is the main forcing causing the change in temperature currently if your point is that there are other greenhouse gases and other factors affecting the climate then this is nothing new
  there are big problems with these madeup importance to greenhouse effect ratios youre pulling out of your ass nobody in climate science uses these techniques     but honestly the more compelling issue is this  whats the worst thing that could come from reducing pollution and switching to sustainable energy we stop making the atmosphere give us cancer and cause our kids to develop asthma we dont render species extinct that support entire ecosystems and produce unique lifesaving biomolecules what a fucking travesty
  those two posts havent refuted anything  the first refuted the entire line of argument focusing on the irrelevant percentage of the atmosphere or percentage of the greenhouse effect    the second refuted the claim that weve had global warming for 10000 years and that this is part of that natural cycle    please explain where these posts fail    the refutation relies on the main talking points of a theory that even the ipcc itself admits is at a less than perfect 95 confidence level  how are those talking points wrong
  so the salt water spontaneously just starts emitting co2 
  gas solubility in water is inversely proportional to temperature get water warmer and it stops being as good at dissolving gasses     ever boiled water before when it starts getting hot but not yet boiling  you get stationary bubbles at the bottom of your pot that is the atmosphere previously dissolved in water now precipitated out as a gas
  what when you increase the temperature of water with co2 in it more co2 evaporates into the atmosphere the warming is not spontaneous it is caused by an increase in solar radiation due to orbital eccentricity
  you are seemingly content with the 9095 probability estimate of primary co2 driven climate change  fine   but i think this thread also discusses issues in that 5 to 10 area of uncertainty so just crowing about the main points is not a good enough of a refutation
    is anyone claiming the the solar radiation changes start a different oceanic biological phenomena or a we sticking with basic chemistry 
  i have no idea what youre smoking if you warm up the oceans potentially by having the planet absorb more solar radiation the oceans will release co2 due to decreased gas solubility     by biological phenomena i guess you could also bring up the fact that shellbearing marine life and phytoplankton are substantial sinks for co2 and their contribution to sequestering carbon goes away if you boil the oceans and kill them all
  this post alleges then that in geological time without industrial co2 being released into earths atmosphere that solar radiation causes the temperature to rise and oceans to give up co2 which then causes the co2 levels in ice cores to correlate with global temperatures determined with oxygen isotope analysis of the ice cores  no 
  there are other factors involved with milankovich cycles like feedback loops between ice coverage and albedo im sure there are some theories about biological factors too
  ok but even if you ignore the evidence behind the consensus the first point is essentially a strawman since no one claims that the entire greenhouse effect is a problem and the second point is an empirical claim that has to be decided based on the evidence available what evidence is there that global warming occured for the past 10000 years none as far as i can see
  could be very complex
  whats the worst thing that could come from reducing pollution and switching to sustainable energy  you heat the situation like in germany spend billions of tax payers money to fail to achieve set goals renewable energy still cannot replace fossil power plants due to the closing down of plants people lost theirs jobs and the average joe is paying record prices for electricity but hey at least we reduced global co2 emissions but 01
  looks like they made substantial progress to me  
  yes this is why we must protect the economy and continuing burning fossil fuels after all only in a few decades when the leftist cucks have been taken out of power and the whole world converts to nuclear will it be feasible and by then the biased leftist beta faggot science will be gone and we will be on our way to moon base and mars base and aldeberan base the leftist cuck faggot beta incel dweeb nerds do not realize that all of this is our dominion this planet is ours to destroy think about the germanic elite and the jews and all the hard working billionaires and millionaires and the average joe hans and fritz they wont be able to watch their cuckold porn anymore if we do not continue destroying all ecosystems on earth faster than we can technologically compensate and continue trying in vain to extract fuel from the earth and make everything just awful think about hans and fritz anons there are bigger things in this life than the entirety of the biosphere
  what evidence is there that global warming occured for the past 10000 years none as far as i can see  not sure what you mean  if you look up ice age on wiki for example it clearly shows a general warming trend from a low of around 11500 years ago continuing to present
  our renewable energy act was passed way later since we decommissioned nuclear power plants at the same time we have to buy electricity from abroad over the recent years electricity bills have increased by about 300 a year
  any comments on the meteoric increase in the first derivative of that global temperature curve that happens to coincide with the beginning of the industrial revolution
  and if hans and fritz are not happy with your climate change bullshit they will vote you out of office and start building those sweet coal plants again
  thats a substantially lower cost to consumers than what other countries are going to have to do to meet their mdgs     its not like im saying that there arent shortterm economic costs to the consumer for combating emissions but the longterm costs associated with climate change pretty much dwarf that by orders of magnitude check out how much economic damage an extra severe hurricane per year would do worldwide     on another note  migrant issues are a major political problem in germany no are you all ready to accept even more migrants fleeing droughtinduced famines
  like the ipcc says it seems to correlate too strongly with mans activities to be coincidental
  migrants can fuck off they are just trying to get into our social welfare system
  he thinks that the little folks will have choice ever again within the next 30 years  
  sounds like youve got another reason to support sustainable energy considering that climate change is already starting to destabilize the developing world and will absolutely push migrants into your country
  please mr finkelstein dont steal my dreams 
  no we just build a wall we are full
  he thinks i mean the kikes  oh anon
  thats not going to happen tho /
  first you steal my hopes and dreams and not you are telling me that my mortal enemy is my friend fiendish
  at least three potential problems here    the anthropogenics are complex and involve so much more than co2  the tracking of co2 to mean temperature has been shown within this thread to not rely on man caused sources  any model may be biased politically or otherwise
its not global warming you dumb fucking ape    the seasons are being pushed back    its fucking 65 degrees in st louis on december 2 2018    it has never ever ever been this warm here in history of data being taken in this area    the seasons this case winter is being pushed back to february/march time period instead of rn
  the problem is that we did not contribute significantly to anything we do not bomb the middle east and we are literally full anymore shitskins and we would literally become the third world
  lol dipshit whos talking about venus we live in a world where a couple years of drought cause wars and mayhem what do you think 4 degrees warmth and 50 metres rising sea levels will do
  fortunately yall get a say in whether you want slightly cheaper power bills or global destabilization of agriculture that will promote fun stuff like migrant crises and terrorism    isis doesnt exist anymore and the syrian civil war is moreorless ramping down at this point you gotta look ahead to the next possible social crisis hitting your country  not being fixated on the one that happened already
  isis and the syrian civil war were not caused by global warming by any means it was western interventionism to replace a democratically elected government even without any sort of climate change africa will fuck itself over because the entire continent is a desaster
  isis and the syrian civil war were not caused by global warming by any means it was western interventionism to replace a democratically elected government    correct just because droughts do not cause /all/ wars does not mean that they do not cause wars period fighting climate change will not prevent wars induced by imperialism but it will prevent wars induced by crop failure and mass starvation
  i think that the lack of contraception will lead to massive starvation way before climate change will ever kick in within my life time thats exactly my problem why fuck ourselves over for something that will happen way in the future if we completely ignore current problems  i dont care about an additional degree celsius in 100 years if germany doesnt exist anymore at that point
  arab spring was caused by rising bread prices and during the arab spring a civil war within syria started this has nothing to do with whitey boogeyman access to fresh water which also plays a huge role in the palestineconflict is also already playing a role in syria
  i dont care about an additional degree celsius in 100 years if germany doesnt exist anymore at that point    but you will if germany does exist at that point  so why ensure failure when there are potential futures where emissions will matter a lot population growth is much less of a big deal if it isnt coupled with massive pollution due to industrialization
  be hungry  fuck up your country  i dont see the profit there
  i dont care about an additional degree celsius in 100 years if germany doesnt exist anymore at that point    the best way to keep germoney alive is to stop climate change because the really big refugee crisis didnt even start yet
  but overpopulation is a huge problem in any case and judging by the current trends in birth rates the native population will disappear at some point its a very real problem if you have been to a german town recently yet politicians only talk about abstract shit nobody cares about if the authorities wouldnt parrot the climate change narrative nobody would care most of the population hasnt even heard of statistics and science its just an appeal to authority and even then most people just pretend to care if we wanted to cut pollution we would continue nuclear power but i guess thats bad too
  overpopulation is a big problem but it has a builtin solution human population growth follows a logistic trajectory not an exponential when societies become postindustrial birth rates slow down dramatically japans population is actually declining as a result of this     emissions has no such control people still need to drive cars eat food and shower with hot water in a postindustrial society the switch to carbonneutral energy sources has to happen or the total emission curve just keeps going up
  any model may be biased politically or otherwise  read as  i will handwave away any evidence i dont like by claiming its biased
  and we will never reach a sufficiently low emission level i dont really care about climate change but i dont wanna pollute the environment with coal for example obviously i would gladly replace those power plants but there is no decent alternative right now large energy companies are only investing in renewable energy sources because of subsidies and even if we had reached our emission goals we would have still be dwarfed by countries like china or india its utterly pointless for us just look at the french riots because of mere gas prices as long as current problems are ignored we dont even need to talk about what is going to happen in fifty years
  the bigger role that germany can play is political  large international communities can exert significant economic pressure on polluters to be party to something like that germany has to play ball and follow the same rules     for what its worth nuclear power is a completely valid approach to this i am not entirely familiar with the history of nuclear in germany but if theyve cut it back thats obviously a bad move
  you climate alarmists are getting increasingly nervous every year so much you hate to admit the complexity of the climate and go to juvenile namecalling when co2 is compared to the earths temperatures millions of years ago there is no direct causation your argument measurements going back that far isnt accurate well how convenient still doesnt explain why there was a mini ice age during the 1500s1600s so much the baltic oceans froze to the point sweden became a military power by land armies again how convenient climate science tunnel visions the 200 year period
  i have no argument so ill just pull shit out of my ass
  you climate alarmists are getting increasingly nervous every year  yeah guess why
  french riots were staged by the saudis
  our nuclear power plants are pretty good but merkel decided to fish for green votes but phasing them out due to fukushima  in my opinion you can only truly push for emission reduced power sources if you have the population willingly participate as long as climate change is just another tax on top of everything else there will be no real change
  that is shitty about your nuclear power plants i agree that policy has to follow education but theres also a time limit on this kind of thing the us is boned quite bad on this front because education is less predictive of support for climate science than political party  because of course it is but apparently thats not the case everywhere
  this article discusses some of the problems with climate change models        an excerpt from the article    possible biases from nonunit forcing efficacy temperature estimation issues and variability in sea  surface temperature change patterns are examined and found to be minor when using globally complete   temperature data these results imply that high ecs and tcr values derived from a majority of cmip5   climate models are inconsistent with observed warming during the historical period
    this is from the ipcc itself    the ipccs fifth assessment report ar5 relies heavily on the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 a collaborative climate modelling process coordinated by the world climate research programme wcrp    
    op is either a troll or a shill move on
  here is a direct link to the paper        here is a somewhat easier to read paper on the subject    
  first they ignore you  then they laugh at you  then they fight you
  the anthropogenics are complex and involve so much more than co2  co2 is by far the dominant forcing see pic    the tracking of co2 to mean temperature has been shown within this thread to not rely on man caused sources  what is that even supposed to mean of course naturally emitted co2 impacts the climate in the same way as humanemitted co2    any model may be biased politically or otherwise  so youre just going to ignore the models that say things you dont want to hear
  co2 is by far the dominant forcing  claimed based on model data against the items chosen to be in that table you dont seem to understand that this is theoretical science not scientific law    of course naturally emitted co2 impacts the climate in the same way as humanemitted co2  yes insignificantly for the amounts in question according to op argument   are you saying that preindustrial co2 is more likely to track temperature or temperature is more likely to track co2      ignore the models  no the models do show something but the conclusions are subject to debate
  i dont know what a scientific theory is  ok shill
how about this as evidence for op argument    on average total annual precipitation has increased over land areas in the united states and worldwide see figures 1 and 2 since 1901 global precipitation has increased at an average rate of 008 inches per decade while precipitation in the contiguous 48 states has increased at a rate of 017 inches per decade    
  what a npc like rebuttal
  how much do you get paid
  first you have to explain how it relates to ops argument
  fact co2 isnt that dangerous and the effects quite reversible
    environmental scientists will try to refute your points by claiming that the added co2 from human emissions disrupts a feedback loop and destabilizes the climate but will utterly fail to explain how this feedback loop even works in the first place what the coefficients are etc     the models fail to predict weather even one week from now
is anything op is saying false or misleading that can be explained away with direct science not involving climate change history statistics  or models     the basic premise is that trace amounts of the co2 molecule in the air cannot compete with the normal water vapor present to produce a significant change in greenhouse effect to produce real temperature changes measured    what is the nature of the co2 molecule in relation to much larger amounts of n2 o2 and h2o and how is its direct contribution to thermal absorption and reflection calculated in this mix of molecules     using the language of other posts  how does the co2 molecule win the forcing   contest explained with molecular chemistry/ physics not statistical empirical observation 
  doesnt even deny to be a shill  hahahaha  so how much
  where do you see that    its simply not true we were cooling for several thousand years after interglacial warming
  
    why isnt water vapor included in the forcing calculation
  /biz/tard here    how do i short this
      if you read the article and the comments it does not answer the question   the article does not explain the water vapor feedback process well enough presumably it relates to initial co2 effects warming the ocean to evap more but does not mention co2 released from the ocean itself nor justify the co2 effects in the first place
  right hand side a ways down on wiki page ice age  i think its actually a glacial period though
  this is the formula for co2 radiative forcing    delta_f  535  lnco2_new / co2_old watts / meter exp 2    how they came up with this and how you correct this for atmospheric conditions is beyond me
                  
  control people with oxygen availability
  heat from the sun is the same every year  like clockwork eh every year forever sure good thing most people have common sense not to buy into co2 lies
  how much just tell me already i might become a shill too
  how about you create something that can be repeated experimentally why should anyone believe co2 is the main driver and not other greenhouse gases no show me your data i wanna see it
  why are you evading my question very suspicious i smell a conspiracy  also 
how do i become a shill
  if anything stated on his page was true the effect of co2 emission would be instant that obviously hasnt been the case even in your lovely 200 year timescale admit that the climate is much more complex than a simple input output with co2 as a single variable and has many more paremeters this is why every model fails and a new one has to be crafted all the time this isnt science this is just sad and pathetic
  this is just sad and pathetic  no thats you dumb shill
you know the ice sheet in the south pole is increasing in thickness atm yes not as much as it used to but still hey those poor icebears nothing to do with anything cyclical all co2
  why do you suddenly believe mainstream science
  pic related is from nasa btw
  what you circled is way bigger than the last 10000 years look at the x axis warming ended before the last 10000 years
  the basic premise is that trace amounts of the co2 molecule in the air cannot compete with the normal water vapor present to produce a significant change in greenhouse effect to produce real temperature changes measured  this was already refuted here   there is no competition because the change in temperature is caused by the change in greenhouse gases from the baseline not the total amount of greenhouse gases if you are comparing co2 to the total atmosphere or the total greenhouse effect you are already off topic
  heat from the sun is decreasing though less heat from the sun causes warming
    link related is from nasa btw
  water vapor is a feedback not a forcing its a function of temperature
  yes the temperature is slowly decreasing doesnt happen overnight
  it was very hot a few days ago that means youre wrong
  the article does not explain the water vapor feedback process well enough   did you read the citations    presumably it relates to initial co2 effects warming the ocean to evap more but does not mention co2 released from the ocean itself nor justify the co2 effects in the first place  its any initial warming not just co2 why would an article about water vapor specifically justify the greenhouse effect if you want evidence of the greenhouse effect read another article    youre obviously just grasping at straws with no real argument
  if anything stated on his page was true the effect of co2 emission would be instant   this is like saying that if flames actually radiated heat then water would boil instantly doesnt your complete ignorance of basic physics deter you from speaking on such topics or are you just delusional
  ah funny how they dont match for the period of 20022008 period odd how european satelites report it differently   
  but muh trace gas   yeah  since we have such a nice person on the internet who has already explained this before for those who have a hard time with breathing  here you go little sandmonkey      saged
  obviously within a short timeframe notice how there was a cooling in the economic boom of 4070 and there was an increase in temperature during the oil shortage dont exaggerate now
  
  whats causing the rapid warming
  leprechauns
  when will the temperature go below the temperature prior to the industrial revolution
  obviously within a short timeframe  short timeframe is vague and not instant    notice how there was a cooling in the economic boom of 4070 and there was an increase in temperature during the oil shortage  already explained  
shills getting blown out again
  funny how solar activity matches those of aerosols emissions really makes you think
  how much
  depends how much i lie about it
  so youre getting a lot right now
  yes
  this series argues for support of co2 theory but makes all kinds of subtle assumptions same as the main theorist do   it does debunk/ clarify some of the worst of the deniers speculation but the series itself is too biased to mediate the two sides in a truly severely critical manner  this series does have a lot of interesting chit chat on various topics just dont totally believe either side
daily reminder that models which predict solar activity also predict changes in climate far better than any climate scientist
  the only things i could find in these videos directly related to op argument was the notion that there is a limit to how much water vapor the atmosphere can hold that doesnt apply to the co2 gas and a brief graph that shows blocking spectrum for h20 is slightly higher in ir frequency than that of co2   not enough there to quantitatively show op claim of water vapor 75x more important to greenhouse effect is false
  this video is interesting    the evidence for climate change without computer models or the ipcc      it presents a theory involving precambrian snowball earth being rescued multiple times by volcanos erupting through the ice and releasing large amounts of co2 the time frame we are talking here is on the order of 1 billion years ago  is this evidence any more believable than the contemporary ipcc models 
  again you have not refuted anything   if nothing else for a very simple reason you have no numbers that are directly relevant    the forcing charts presented here do not even show the relative weight of co2 vs normal n2o2 gas let alone the added contribution of h2o in the complex system of trapping heat near the earths surface   the op argument has numbers and references for justification what you are doing is repeating the same thing i found some ipcc modeling data that looks official and that is all that matters
  funny how it doesnt
  why do you keep lying
  again you have not refuted anything   i have present a counterargument argument or fuck off    if nothing else for a very simple reason you have no numbers that are directly relevant  lol youre projecting the numbers presented in op have no relevance since the total atmosphere or the total greenhouse effect are not being blamed for global warming    the forcing charts presented here do not even show the relative weight of co2 vs normal n2o2  how is their relative weight relevant     let alone the added contribution of h2o  because h2o is not a forcing     the op argument has numbers and references for justification  justification of what you can post all the numbers and references you want youll still fail if they dont support your conclusion    what you are doing is repeating the same thing  wrong the refutation of the first argument relies on no figures the second refuted argument has no data for its claim that there has been global warming for 10000 years so its not his data vs my data its his baseless claim vs the data    are you just going to ignore this yet again and slink away or are you actually going to argue like a man
  i dont youre wrong and a disingenuous shill
  there is no competition because the change in temperature is caused by the change in greenhouse gases from the baseline not the total amount of greenhouse gases    i think your are saying the formula here   10185444  already has the baseline factored into it    if so this formula is still suspect because its existence seems to be at least in part a product of statistical based assumptions
  present a counterargument argument or fuck off  how convenient the models used by the ipcc are shrouded in such complexity that almost no ordinary mortal can refute them    no relevance since the total atmosphere or the total greenhouse effect are not being blamed for global warming  in a way they are the very complexity of the icpp models demonstrates this point     because h2o is not a forcing  why cant it be deemed a forcing component     no data for its claim that there has been global warming for 10000 years  we could survey people after looking at the wiki graph to try to see whether the op essay or wiki is over misrepresenting something  for reference   
  no argument  so you admit youre lying good
  after looking at the wiki graph    i dont know whether this is the end all be all chart to use but it looks like the point of relative maxima for the increase in the last cycle has  not been reached yet if you compare it to the maxima of the other cycles  so from this chart cant we expect further rise regardless of what humans are causing 
  how convenient the models used by the ipcc are shrouded in such complexity that almost no ordinary mortal can refute them  why do you think theyre wrong    in a way they are the very complexity of the icpp models demonstrates this point  how    why cant it be deemed a forcing component  because its a function of temperature ive explained this multiple times already    we could survey people after looking at the wiki graph to try to see whether the op essay or wiki is over misrepresenting something  for reference   sure but first you should conduct a survey for how many people can read an xaxis correctly
  there is no reason further warming should occur to reach the maxima of other interglacials the warming phase of the cycle has already ended
  alexa filter out all of these shill threads
   why do you think theyre wrong  its not that they are necessarily all wrong but in this thread the complexity of the models makes it difficult to refute op in clear and intuitive way that more lay people can easily grasp      because its a function of temperature  but since it is also a function of human activities cause it must be considered as a primary forcing component also
  read an xaxis correctly    it is not clear the op argument is using this wiki data i looked up the reference 7 but could not get past the foreign language    it seems from wiki saying earth has been warming for the last 20000 years is better than saying 100000 the flattening at the end could be a real downturn or a temporary leveling off i suppose
  its not that they are necessarily all wrong but in this thread the complexity of the models makes it difficult to refute op in clear and intuitive way that more lay people can easily grasp   i refuted his first point without any reference to models and his second point has no basis so there is no need to refute it even though i did this is very easy for lay people to grasp not that that is somehow relevant towards who is correct    but since it is also a function of human activities cause it must be considered as a primary forcing component also  im not exactly sure what youre trying to say but it being a function of human activities means its not a primary forcing a forcing is a factor which affects the energy balance of the earth without itself being determined by the energy balance water vapor is determined by the temperature of the earths surface forcings like changes in solar radiation and manmade emmissions of ghgs are not determined by the energy balance water vapor is instead a feedback which is included in the calculation of the earths climate sensitivity which is the change in temperature that results from a change in radiative forcing
  it is not clear the op argument is using this wiki data  its not clear that the op is using any data if you can refute the ice core data or find data that disagrees then do so otherwise you should admit the argument is refuted    it seems from wiki saying earth has been warming for the last 20000 years is better than saying 100000  it hasnt though warming stopped 10000 years ago the op attempted to argue that the current warming is explained by the natural cycle it doesnt matter how far back you go the cycle is not currently in a warming phase the argument is faulty and we dont even need the ice core data to see this we can see right now whether we are getting an increase in solar radiation thats causing the warming but we dont see that
   a forcing is a factor which affects the energy balance of the earth without itself being determined by the energy balance  it seems like several billion human beings using electricity generated independently of solar radiation collection to boil water 3 times a day would qualify as such    water vapor is determined by the temperature of the earths surface  if you study nasa photos of the man made infrared heat profile of various large metropolis on the earths surface it seems that humans also can control the surface temperature of our planet    so again why should this not be considered a forcing component with perhaps as much significance as the co2 production 
  it seems like several billion human beings using electricity generated independently of solar radiation collection to boil water 3 times a day would qualify as such  it might seem like that but the thing about boiled water is that it tends to just condense right back into water soon after being emitted humans simply dont emit enough water vapor to increase the amount in the atmosphere however human land use specifically deforestation and land use does indirectly effect global water vapor levels and human land use is a forcing    if you study nasa photos of the man made infrared heat profile of various large metropolis on the earths surface it seems that humans also can control the surface temperature of our planet  ok how does this respond to my point many human activities are measured as forcings    so again why should this not be considered a forcing component with perhaps as much significance as the co2 production   it is considered a forcing but its effect is negligible compared to co2 emissions
  specifically deforestation and agriculture
  consider    we know that the global humidity is all over the place in time and magnitude the same as temperature   what would be important is an overall aggregate average delta such as with co2 that might cause measureable changes   of several degrees that would then have marked effects on the earths climate and ecosystems    for co2 the presumptive radiation forcing is given as     delta_f  535  lnco2_new / co2_old watts / meter exp 2 equation 1    but since water vapor is not considered a forcing factor it is bound up in this equation in a way that has  proven near impossible to unravel    assume for a moment that trace greenhouse gasses are not in the picture that is the earths atmosphere consists  entirely of n2o2 and h2o in vapor suspension of varying overall average amounts through time   assume also that solar radiation is a flat constant   consider a scalar quantity called the average aggregate vapor suspension figure based on a statistical measurement process   now suppose we monitor this figure relative to an estimated figure purported to exist in 1750  so we can have an analogous radiative forcing equation for atmospheric h2o in fact i would say for the ipccs models   to make scientific sense there must be an equation analogous to equation 1     where is it      that is what is needed to properly refute the op argument
  alarmist shills getting btfo again  ftfy
  the total human contribution to atmospheric carbon dioxide since the start of the industrial revolution has been estimated at about 25 so humans carbon dioxide greenhouse effect is a quarter of 0013  works out to about 000325   you cant just multiply a bunch of numbers together and then pretend that means something thats not how physics works
  all current food plants especial high yield grains were all breed under rising co2    013 co2 is why plants need 100x as much water to make unit of food    if we go back to 1700 co2 level all these crops will suddenly need 40 more rainfall    40 is tiny when a  of a 013 but is unthinkable in average rainfall    return to 1700 co2 would trigger crop failure as has never been imagined    return to 1700 co2 levels only possible if human population returned to maybe 1800 level    imo first job of us govt and maybe un would be build massive grain surplus and storage in tradition of old pharaohs to safe guard against end of man made climate change
  but since water vapor is not considered a forcing factor it is bound up in this equation in a way that has proven near impossible to unravel  you appear to be assuming that radiative forcing is supposed to calculate the total the change in temperature and therefore has to implicitly include warming from water vapor its not    where is it    did you attempt even a single google search to look for it its called climate sensitivity    dont you think it would be easier for you if you actually did a bit of research on the science youre attempting to criticize instead of guessing what it contains and having me refute you guesses
  just admit its not easy to refute the op using those complex climate models     in over 200 posts no one has refuted the op in a way that ultimately doesnt require a phd to understand
  is this supposed to be a compelling argument just because you arent trained to follow a line of reasoning doesnt mean its wrong
  all current food plants especial high yield grains were all breed under rising co2  large scale agricultural breeding began about 10000 years ago co2 was between 260 and 280 ppm that entire time     if we go back to 1700 co2 level all these crops will suddenly need 40 more rainfall  citation needed    return to 1700 co2 would trigger crop failure as has never been imagined  a return to 1700 co2 would remove the negative effects to agriculture caused by rapid warming droughts low soil moisture and heat damage on the whole it would benefit agriculture    return to 1700 co2 levels only possible if human population returned to maybe 1800 level  this is just a blatant lie it will take hundreds of years to remove our emissions but it does not necessitate any loss of population
  just admit its not easy to refute the op using those complex climate models   i didnt even use any complex climate models so its very easy    in over 200 posts no one has refuted the op in a way that ultimately doesnt require a phd to understand  in over 200 posts no one has refuted my refutation in any way whatsoever you lost get over it
  when the north polar ice caps freezes again in 3040 years remember back in this thread when your stance helped interfere with human economic progress screencap this
  remember back in this thread when your stance helped interfere with human economic progress
  im completely ignorant of the science and data relevant to predicting the climate  every single argument ive made in this thread has been btfo  but trust me i know better than the climatologists and my prediction will come true  deniers truly are mentally ill
  this is just a blatant lie it will take hundreds of years to remove our emissions but it does not necessitate any loss of population  it does because we cant feed nor generate energy to sustain the current much less the late 21st century projected population of 10 b people especially since 90 of them are going to be 100 iq
  analysis summary     since a dangerous accelerating climate warming simply does not exist after decades of vast amounts of human greenhouse emissions being released it is fair to conclude that the consensus of a catastrophic runaway global warming is debunked and entirely without any empirical merit or validity
  trend per century  my god you are truly retarded this is literally a meaningless statistic     yeah clearly there is no correlation pic related    and clearly the greenhouse effect doesnt exist
  since a dangerous accelerating climate warming simply does not exist after decades of vast amounts of human greenhouse emissions being released  what is dangerous acceleration the danger is in the rapid rate of the warming not its acceleration this is a retarded strawman    it is fair to conclude that the consensus of a catastrophic runaway global warming is debunked and entirely without any empirical merit or validity  the consensus is that runaway warming will not occur you just confirmed that this is a strawman
  greenhouse effect doesnt exist  literally no one is saying that we arent on a course for doomsday within 100 years
  iirc claim is we have 40 more co2 than before industrial era    that means all new man bred plants have luxury of needing 40 less water    conversely if co2 reduced all plants will need 40 more water and that aint ever gonna happen by long shot    we dont even know if modern grains can function at 1800s levels of co2 who knows maybe they just cant pull that much water to exchange that much co2 starved air
  you just posted a graph that claims there is no correlation between surface temperature trends and co2 levels the greenhouse effect directly disproves this via causation not to mention that your graph doesnt show what it claims to show    we arent on a course for doomsday within 100 years  climatologists dont talk about doomsdays they talk about damage to infrastructure and ecosystems we rely on that is occurring right now and will continue to occur why do you keep attacking strawmen are you just ignorant of what climatologists are saying or are you lying about it
  iirc claim is we have 40 more co2 than before industrial era  that means all new man bred plants have luxury of needing 40 less water  bahahahahahahaha    denier science everyone    oh wow you cant make this shit up
  iirc claim is we have 40 more co2 than before industrial era  that means all new man bred plants have luxury of needing 40 less water  so youre telling me once we double the co2 plants wont need any water wow so all we need to do is pump our greenhouses with some co2 and well never need to water again the desert will bloom    thank you brave anon youre nobel is in the mail
  wait wait what if we do more than double the co2 that means plants will give us water    free water for everyone
  posting in epic thread nobel prize confirmed
  good because al gores alarmist attitude is total bs nice we finally can agree on that
   you   iirc claim is we have 40 more co2 than before industrial era   that means all new man bred plants have luxury of needing 40 less water   so youre telling me once we double the co2 plants wont need any water wow so all we need to do is pump our greenhouses with some co2 and well never need to water again the desert will bloom   thank you brave anon youre nobel is in the mail      correct if you increase co2 for a water critical plant the plant will use correspondingly less water    this would be nice easy experiment for you    co2 is easy to come by    plants open pores depending on how much co2 they need and how much water they can spare    we learned all about this in hs science     exchanging their inner air at 100 humidity for outside air is an issue no plants have ever been able to work around even cacti    once you grasp a few concepts you wont follow people like al gore
  plotting temperature rate against co2 anomaly  what are you even trying to accomplish
  there is evidence for high co2 volume concentrations between 200 and 150 million years ago of over 3000 ppm  and between 600 and 400 million years ago of over 6000 ppm    in 2010 914 gigatonnes of carbon gtc equivalent to 335 gigatonnes of co2 or about 43 ppm in earths atmosphere  were released from fossil fuels and cement production worldwide    the natural decay of organic material in forests and grasslands and the action of forest fires results in the  release of about 439 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide every year    at current atmospheric pressures plant photosynthesis shuts down when atmospheric co2 concentrations fall below 150 ppm  and 200 ppm although some microbes can extract carbon from the air at much lower concentrations    a 1993 review of scientific greenhouse studies found that a doubling of co2 concentration would stimulate the growth of  156 different plant species by an average of 37    currently about 57 of humanemitted co2 is removed by the biosphere and oceans
  do you have some kind of point
  nope
come on shills refute this  im waiting
  that doesnt answer his question if reduction in water needed is equivalent to growth in co2 then that means a 100 growth in co2 would allow plants to reduce their water consumption by 100 meaning plants would need 0 water obviously this is biologically impossible and your hypothesis is wrong
  010 cents per post right now im at 003 for just text and 005 for ones with ones with images
i believe in science
i dont know a single person that doesnt have some sort of defect/illness im talking everything from minor stuff like pollen allergies to major genetic health problems it seems like everyone has something     i guess theyre becoming more and more common with advancements in medicine but even then why are they so incredibly common how common are these problems in animals is it because humans are more complex genetically or because we let too many kids grow up that would die in the animal world i know that the amount of offspring born in comparison to how many live to reproduce varies substantially in the animal world are humans supposed to have 810 children where only 23 live to reproduce like in medieval times
  sin perfection belongs to god
dude its called dysgenics what did you think was going to happen if we removed selective pressures from society for 200 years
how fucking dare he
we do what we must because we can t science
any psychiatrist here like in the question recently i read a lot of article about that and still does not found clearly answer  picture is from wikipedia
is possible to developer schizophrenia  no
long term meth usage
  yes just change the definition of the term schizophrenia so it includes the parameters to do what you want
  why do non english people use this website i imagine it would be super difficult to sift through the irony and memes    it is possible but very very very rare
  tulpamancy
  is schizophrenia even real does it truly exist i saw it gradually happen to a guy i worked next to but i thought it was because he did not keep his mind clean for the longest time he would still be able to go back to normal when the big boss was around eventually he was obvious seemed like he made the choice to crazy up like it was working for him or something
  i dont know has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like
the recent publishments ive read about it in illustrated science claim that it is 99 percent genetics
  schizophrenia is 80 genetic so doubt it but then again do you know what genes you have
schizophrenia is not very well understood and comes in multiple flavors if you want john nash style auditory hallucinations there is no real way to develop that consistently you could try for hppd but that would give you undesired visual snow if you want catatonic schizophrenic symptoms i would think destroying your neurotransmitter system through abuse of drugs like mdma may work
  be me  18  smoke weed for a couple years  decide to drop acid with friends  enlightenedjpg  time passes and i stop doing drugs  friends in town want to trip acid  fuck it  chilled out in living room talking w bros while tripping  start laughing because my friend is laughing  funny as fuck im going to lose my head  sidesgone  blackout laughing  snapback to reality  ive been laughing for five minutes straight at nothing  bro looks at me  well that was scary  walk outside    get hit with spots that look like i got up too fast/im dehydrated    mfw my friends stopped tripping 30 mins ago    mfw i still see the spots whenever i feel anxious
  psychology is a meme science unlike mathematics mental illness doesnt exist
  you ever think you might just be dehydrated which is why you get anxiety and spots
  its probably possible a gross oversimplification is that schizophrenia is basically caused by excessive neurodegeneration    retard    indeed drug abuse increases risk    yes environmental factors increase risk of developing it ironically a number of mental disorders can be exacerbated and brought on by self destructive crazy behavior you asked for it    retard
  yeah id like to think so but i also see outlines of shit when i look away after focusing i know its hppd i figure i just have to get used to it shrug
  it doesnt exist objectively lol its all subjective
schizophrenia is a genetically complex disease meaning that there are hundreds or thousands of genes that have statistically significant effects on the likelihood of developing the disease rather than a single disease allele like you see in mendelian diseases such as sickle cell anemia so its possible for someone with no family history of schizophrenia to still have a latent risk due to having a higher burden of schizophrenia genes due to environmental effects on the person eg marijuana living in a city stress fetal environment
  amnd agonists i believe their called block glutamate reception which can produce schizophrenic symptoms but their is likely a genetic aspect to that too
schizophrenia is a learned behavior
  this
    mental illness doesnt exist    modern understanding of psychology is a meme and a lot of people are suffering because of it
  mental illness is not a thing/cant be measured  physical brain damage neurochemical abnormality drugs etc the brain is a physical organ subject to physical and chemical phenomena    modern psychology  posts 58 year old essay  btfo with your stone age disinfo
  nmda receptors and the agonists activate the receptors drugs like ketamine i believe genes involved with nmda have been implicated in schizophrenics
  it would be super difficult to sift through the irony and memes    not at all i was barely able to introduce myself and ask for directions in english with what i learned in school   its thanks to the internet and mainly 4chan that i was fluent in english like one year later    it really is an easy language and i bet there are way more nonenglish people than we imagine              were not on /x/ here stop with this stupidity go work with mentally ill people for a month and youll see if schizophrenia isnt real or if the drugs do nothing
  indeed nmda receptors are implicated as dysfunctional or abnormal in schizophrenics but the nmda antagonism model of schizophrenia only get some things right it also only lasts for as long as you are high as well the only real nmda agonists are glutamate and the other coagonists found naturally in your body btw      i read a study that made a bunch of primates schizophrenic permanently but im not going to tell you how they did it nor am i going to tell you what drug they used all the humans ive asked that tried it regretted it and stopped before they fully made themselves exhibit schizophrenic like traits as in the primates due to losing sleep they also havent recovered the ability to have a full nights rest anymore funnily enough you can easily get the drug required from a psychiatrist
  well yeah a huge number of factors and corresponding genes are implicated i didnt literally mean ketamine is involves in schizophrenia ha        very good review/hypothesis about schizophrenia
   illness is not a thing/cant be measured  physical brain damage neurochemical abnormality drugs etc the brain is a physical organ subject to physical and chemical phenomena  not op but thats the point any neurological illness should be measured and understood empirically there is not even an attempt to explain depression or adhd at a mechanistic level they are defined entirely by dubious subjective criteria and therefore should not be considered medical diseases they are at best broad categories of behavior
  were not on /x/ here stop with this stupidity go work with mentally ill people for a month and youll see if schizophrenia isnt real or if the drugs do nothing  i find it very taxing to be confronted with this level of idiocy there is a difference between a display of symptoms and a welldefined disease someone who is hallucinating and incoherent clearly has a neurological pathology no one is debating that the debate is about whether or not schizophrenia is a valid diagnosis of such symptomatology what empirical grounds are there to conclude that all hallucinating or disoriented patients have this singular disorder called schizophrenia does schizophrenia provide any biological explanation for the symptoms is there any aspect of the schizophrenia diagnosis which can be confirmed empirically    when looked at with even the slightest scrutiny the idea that there is a wellfounded disease called schizophrenia is ridiculous schizophrenia is obviously just a vacuous label used to define a wide class of neurological pathologies which are not yet understood
op here thank you for a lot of answers and sorry for my english is not very good
  fuck why does this image make me so anxious and nauseous
  what a simpleton i agree that a lot of stuff published out there is obedient to some sort of industry and that always raises questions about transparency but fuck you that happens in every field of human pursuit   saying that an entire field of study is invalid because some assholes inside profit through shit work is just stupid   there are fields of study in which the data we currently have is solid for example in personality differences what we are beggining to understand comes along very nicely with biological premises in evolutionary terms i think that says that we are at least pointing in the right direction on that   pharma sucks yea
  i still have minor visuals even after 20 years of not taking acid especially when i take a shit in a bright public bathroom for some reason
    its long been known about the heterogeneity of schizophrenia hence dimensional views of it that have been around since the 90s but there is a pragmatism for the diagnosis of schizophrenia and its treatment and infact in recent decades the diagnostics of schizophrenia and several other disorders have been altered to reflect this and there are numerous disorders of halluconation or delusion they arent just rammed into the schizophrenia category  your nitpicking about what constitutes a disease is annoying since many medical conditions are incomplete in that regard or have unknown aetiologies pathophysiological mechanisms etc    there are also some good potential biological explanations of the schizophrenias on the horizon eg   and contrary to what you might think there are a number of cognitive and biological markers and endophenotypes that are quite specific to schizophrenia    i feel youve got a naive view on this in the sense you are citing the obvious as if you are saying something radical and new that no one else is thinking about in the field
  youre rambling because you know dont have a legitimate argument to defend your frail belief system yes many disorders are poorly understood but there is a difference between a disorder being poorly understood and a disorder having no empirical definition if an ostensible diagnosis makes no attempt at a biological etiology and cannot be verified empirically it is not scientifically valid schizophrenia is a hollow label used on a wide category of unexplained neurological aberrations that is not a disease nor a valid diagnosis throughout the history of psychiatry there have been a litany of similar illegitimate diagnoses like monomania and melancholy these are now correctly regarded as pseudoscience in one hundred years schizophrenia will be seen in the same light a meaningless label lacking any semblance of scientific rigor
  do you get headaches my family has a history of migraines and ive found after alleviating the migraine i get less visuals
  a meaningless label  i would agree with you on a lot mental illnesses and all personality disorders but schizos in particular develop serious cognitive deficits that are recognizable and begin happening to them prior to a psychotic episode the deficits in cognitive abilities is literally the core feature of schizos and can be empirically seen in a rapid reduction of the brain volume schizophrenia isnt so much a psychological/emotional problem as it is a neurological one thats going to require serious advances in neuroscience to cure
  i dont think so but if you want auditory hallucinations thatll fuck you up for a large portion of your life you can just drop a shitload of acid like brian wilson did
  if an ostensible diagnosis makes no attempt at a biological etiology and cannot be verified empirically it is not scientifically valid    not true for many medical conditions a specific aetiology cannot be inferred at diagnosis and for many conditions including lots of common ones the pathophysiology isnt well understood    schizophrenia is a hollow label used on a wide category of unexplained neurological aberrations that is not a disease nor a valid diagnosis    it reflects commonly occurring symptoms that are distinct from other disorders disorders yes there is a great heterogeneity in presentation and many contributing pathophysiologies but that is normal for any complex system or illness theres always variation in presentation its just where you decide to draw the line you could go as far to say that every individual has a slightly different disease   the similarities and specifics warrants them being treated and studied similarly even if it is just a crude label and again you can find strong consistent endophenotypes and cognitive or biological markers in schizophrenia ive also already linked you a good theory about the pathophysiology of schizophrenias    throughout the history of psychiatry there have been a litany of similar illegitimate diagnoses like monomania and melancholy    diagnosis continually changes in psychiatry because the complexity of the brain renders it impossible to create objective diagnoses that are not intractable or too complex diagnosis is subjective and i guarantee that psychiatry in the future wont be about making diagnoses objective its impossible if anything it will go down the route of personalised precision analyses of someones symptoms at the end of the day all disease labels are socially constructed the categorization is secondary and even if you dont like the category you cant deny alot of valid science is being done to understand schizophrenia/s    
  double binds
  its weird af nibba
  that study reads like a pop sci article on schizophrenia      would have linked this analysis of the nmda antagonism model of schizophrenia with my comment but i did it on my laptop so lmao 
  mental illness doesnt exist   dude were on 4channel
  yes increase your alpha and theta wave output and you can likely achieve schizophrenic like symptoms
  its a short review of atleast 2 decades of research and is written by some of the most esteemed researchers in cognitive neuroscience    also youre confusing things glutamate related abnormalities is a hypothesised part of schizophrenia but the ketamine models related here arent the same when people talk about ketamine or pcp or other types of nmda related models in animals it isnt a hypothesis about how schizophrenia is caused these are models trying to recreate symptoms in animals so you can test drugs its not the same thing at all as a model of how or why schizophrenia occurs obviously they have to be related in some way but its not the same thing
  also youve linked a thesis with no guarantee that any of this is published
  when looked at with even the slightest scrutiny the idea that there is a wellfounded disease called schizophrenia is ridiculous schizophrenia is obviously just a vacuous label used to define a wide class of neurological pathologies which are not yet understood    100 guarantee you have never read a single research paper on schizophrenia and have no formal training in a related field
  also youve linked a thesis with no guarantee that any of this is published    and the only reason those ketamine models are called models is because the animal is the model its not a model as in scientific hypothesis completely different
  not sure why youre trying to put words in my mouth but no point reading your comment after i saw that eggs d
  myth of mental illness is specifically a critique of freudian psychoanalysis and a response to the oldschool american institutionalized model of psychiatry it has nothing to do with modern psychiatry the book/essay got famous because the freud shills who ran the old asylums were getting kicked out of their jobs in the 50s and szasz wrote a book dabbing on them freudian psychoanalysts couldnt put up a defense against the book because theyre intellectually stunted perverts who liferaft onto the first 19th century german they read so they just put up a massive stink about the book instead of writing refutations this caused antipsychiatry activists to also liferaft onto the book because they didnt understand its message      anyway if you actually read his book youd realize that what hes arguing isnt that mental illness is fake lmao but something a lot more subtle its more along the lines of the socalled mentally ill are trying to tell us something important about their lives and our society we should listen and treat them like human beings also everyone should pay out of pocket for healthcare and children cant be surgeons because theyre too short its a message thats only objectionable to freud cucks because they want to go on about their lives calling other people children so they dont have to deal with them or their problems    szasz has a really important point but it only seems like philosophers really understand him      t b h if you want a more modern and refined version read hanna pickards mental illness is indeed a myth      um yes there is sweetie just google scholar it
  psychology is a meme but youre retarded if you think mental illness doesnt exist   your brain is part of your body and subject to defect
  szas sounds like an utter retard and ill never read a book by a woman
    at best broad categories of behavior  which suddenly stops them being things that should be treated    this  was for u btw
  szas sounds like an utter retard and ill never read a book by a woman  nigga you gotta actually read stuff you cant just dismiss ideas by pointing out that you dont like the people who wrote them
  i unironically believe this schizo is you greenlighting your brain to hallucinate shit because you want to see it either out of loneliness or boredom followed by your reward system binding emotional rewards to it and making it basically uncurable think about it what do you think that a tulpa or selfinduced schizophrenia actually is if not exactly that
    think about it what do you think that a tulpa or selfinduced schizophrenia actually is if not exactly that    larping    but more seriously you should form your beliefs about the mechanisms of mental illness from empirical research not your intuitions based on internet stuff for example when you call tulpas selfinduced schizophrenia do you mean that people with tulpas actually meet the clinical criteria for diagnosis professing false beliefs even false sensory experiences isnt the single criterion for schizophrenia
  i mean sure we can argue semantics all day but you very well know what i meant  being able to selfinduce visual and audio hallucinations is a proof that there must be at least a minor greenlight factor in the development of schizophrenia the fact that it tends to develop specifically after or during isolation when one is lonely or during depression is another proof of that   or we can keep arguing about bullshit and argue how isolation is the symptom of schizo not the cause
  its not semantics at allschizophrenia is a cluster of associated symptoms presumed to have an underlying cause with good reason given its apparent heritability you just said that this phenomenon is learned not innatewhich would be remarkable if true given the evidence that there is an underlying genetic component     the fact that it tends to develop specifically after or during isolation when one is lonely or during depression is another proof of that  its not proofthis is classic confirmation bias youre looking at whether or not this is consistent with your theory and not looking at whether it is consistent with other theories how do you know that isolation and loneliness make the person greenlight their brain to hallcuinate rather than socialization having an inhibitory effect on hallucinations that are already present    the fact is youre just shooting from the hip stating very confidently some armchair theory that didnt develop from empirical work
  evidence that there is an underlying genetic component  the genetic component of being able to easily overcome the inborn limitation of our consciousness to control vision and instead have it gain direct control of it therefor creating the supposed predisposition to schizophrenia by making it far easier to enter such a state however with the if only you wanted to and told your brain to do so aspect of it still being there that argument goes both ways    how do you know that isolation and loneliness make the person greenlight their brain to hallcuinate rather than socialization having an inhibitory effect on hallucinations that are already present  well there you go youre arguing whether isolation was the symptom or the cause of schizo this aint going anywhere    the fact is youre just shooting from the hip stating very confidently some armchair theory that didnt develop from empirical work  but of course i am i am merely stating my own theory from what ive observed notice the third word of my initial post
  evidence that there is an underlying genetic component  the genetic component of being able to easily overcome the inborn limitation of our consciousness to control vision and instead have it gain direct control of it therefor creating the supposed predisposition to schizophrenia by making it far easier to enter such a state however with the if only you wanted to and told your brain to do so aspect of it still being there that argument goes both ways  this is blind conjecture stop    well there you go youre arguing whether isolation was the symptom or the cause of schizo  that is not what i said i never said schizo caused isolationi said schizophrenia could be present the whole time but inhibited by socialization then isolation which can arise from circumstances totally unrelated to the schizophrenia can appear to cause the symptoms when in reality its only removing the inhibitor    but of course i am i am merely stating my own theory from what ive observed notice the third word of my initial post  the single biggest problem with public understanding of science is people who think having an opinion or belief on stuff they know absolutely nothing about is legitimate
  and now youre emotionally invested and are trying to adhom my simple share of what i personally think about the subject  predictable directly from the first post
  yes
  lol where is the ad hom all i did was point out that you have zero empirical evidence that supports your theory and your response was basically that its just my opinion
  why wouldnt it exist your brain controls your body your other organs can get sick or damaged why cant your brain
  hey my dude its your philosophy of psychiatry boi posting from the heart of leftist cuck   (((state))) university    people who try to characterize mental illness as brain damage are basically wrong on the grounds that there is no evidence that mental illness corresponds to what we understand as brain damage in neurology we havent found evidence any lesions or other significant anatomical or physiological changes correspond to unique causal factors for mental illness    on the other hand we do know that there are multiple distinct physiological changes that result in the same types of symptom clusters in other words our understanding is beginning to show that mental illness is multiply realized from multiple different types of neurological states and especially for models of addiction many of the changes that occur in your brain when considered alone are totally normal responses to stimuli observed in different scenarios such as habit formation and falling in love in other words the neurological states that cause mental illness are normal brain states    this is a huge issue for neuroscience shills because it means that mental illness doesnt have very much to do with the brain even this is where mental illness originates it has to do with the mind modern science indicates that theres nothing wrong with the brains of most mentally ill people its just that the behaviors and cognition that comes out of the brain is really fucked up you might say that this is a meaningless distinction but you also probably wouldnt say that theres something wrong with your computer when your code doesnt compile normal function of the brain and normal function of a mind are two different things one is a scientific judgment the other requires other sources of knowledge linguistic/psychological moral/ethical and so on     mental illness may or may not exist but its definitely not brain damage
what are the early signs of schizo    i feel like sometimes a little crazy  like losing touch with reality and believing some crazy stuff sometimes very irrational  ive never had hallucinations
  also should add i abused drugs around 15 years old of all sorts from xanax to ketamine lsd research chems like nbome and also stimulants i havent touch drugs now in 4 years
  a brain doesnt haven to be physically damaged to function abnormally or be sick mental illness is still totally to do with the brain        which way madness lies can psychosis be prevented  columbia university  pdfwwwcolumbiaedu pubs avivharpers    this is an article about early potential signs in people    hearing voices are the only hallucinations schizophrenics typically get
i dont have any family history of schizophrenia or anything related at least for what i know ive started hearing and seeing things for about 10 months ive taken risperidone 1 mg for 1 month and the hallucinations have stopped about 95  could it be just my mind trying to troll me
yes it is possible it would be possible by taking large doses of dopaminergic drugs for longs periods of time long term parkinsons patients often develop schitzophrenia or symptoms of such    this is less a psychiatry question and more of a neuropathology question
  schizos have stunted frontal lobes autists have big corpus callosums major depressives have low serotonin activity measure that does the mind shape the brain or does the brain shape the mind both obviously but genetics and environmental factors shape the brain you can assert that the brains of mentally ill people are normal all you want doesnt change the fact that thats as false as claiming that gravitys all in your head man
  schizophrenic people have a barely statistically detectable tendency to have certain brain changes occur sometimes maybe  these same brain changes also sometimes occur in normal people  people who were depressed once get depressed again sometimes if you feed them a weird fucking diet with no tryptophan for months  correlation  causation because im fucking desperate to prove that mental illness is a physical pathology  i also already addressed this point in my first post  its called mental illness and not brain illness for a reason get over yourself
how likely is it that the big bang theory is a load of bullshit and that the universe has always been here
50 either it was or it wasnt
  since time begun with the big bang yes the universe has always been there
  lmaoing at the creationist tier mythology from big bang cucks
  lmaoing at your dunning kruger
  what is the actual reason for this ive heard people say that it doesnt make sense to talk about what went on before the big bang but isnt the big bang just the earliest point in time that could have left evidence of itself for us to study what makes it impossible for there to have been other stuff going on before that point or for that matter stuff going on in regions of space outside the tiny region that ended up being our universe
  since time begun with the big bang  just a theory
  in modern science the term theory refers to scientific theories a wellconfirmed type of explanation of nature made in a way consistent with scientific method and fulfilling the criteria required by modern science such theories are described in such a way that scientific tests should be able to provide empirical support for or empirically contradict falsify it scientific theories are the most reliable rigorous and comprehensive form of scientific knowledge  thanks for backing me up bro
  he doesnt realize that everyone suffers from dunning kruger and thinks hes one of the lucky few  lmaoing at your dunning kruger
  there was in all likelihood a plethora of events that built up to our universe existing  we will never know because those events are outside of our existence    ponder this  galaxies are accelerating away from us except for andromeda which is merging and at some point in time observers in any given galaxy will not be able to see any other galaxies  any intelligence anywhere that arises after that time will look out at the night sky and see only their own galaxy and assume that is all that exists even though theyll discover physics quantum physics relativity etc their view of the universe will be completely wrong and they will never know
  will an empty region of space ever become so homogeneous and devoid of anything it actually ends up circling back around and becoming an environment conducive to another bang
  no  heat death is our future  enjoy it while you can you lucky bastard
  bazoingee    but really we have evidence of universal expansion from a point it makes sense that if you follow that expansion backward you find the universe was at some time very small past a certain point in time we dont know happend so the big bang is our best guess based on physics i dont understand or really care to but other people do understand how we came to that conclusion and i dont have time to study multiple scientific fields indepth if i also want to have a life so i trust the people that do understand it
  heat death  not opting for artificial immortality and ditching this whole dumb reality on a transdimensional ark
  we cant even predict weather patterns with 100 accuracy at the moment let alone what will happen eons in the future lmao
  time and space are just different perspectives of the spacetime according to einsteins theories anyway since mathematically space began after the big bang then logically time should as well remembering time and space are just properties of the spacetime
  he doesnt know about math
  how likely is it that the big bang theory is a load of bullshit  100  and that the universe has always been here  0 there was nothing before god created it
  a geuss
  cringe
  but what created god
unlikely  but something outside of it has always been here
remember the second law of thermodinamics a universe cant keep having stars forever due to increasing entropy there was a moment then the entropy was at a minimun and is increasing till the end of times

be g  doing a phd  one day a trans girl student from one of my classes comes to my office   says she wants to work with me and my phd supervisor as an undergrad  ask her some questions to gauge her level  pretty keen and capable good  ask her to prove that the fundamental group of the quotient space x/g is g itself if its action on the simply connected space x is free and transitive  she freezes up  ok ask her instead to prove that two curves on a manifold have trivial tangent spaces at a point iff they intersect transversally  her face flushes red as if shes on the brink of tears  uh oh lets try something easier  ask her to prove that ever permutation can be uniquely decomposed into a product of transpositions  she bursts out my office crying   wtf  days later got called into the department office and got chewed out for being transphobic and that ill have my phd grant revoked if this happens again  mfw
asking an undergrad phd level questions and expecting them to know the answers  she it didnt have to burst out crying though could have just said i have no clue lmao
  all of those are questions a 2/3rd year math student should be able to do

the key reason for the trannys response here is that in each of your questions you used a word that contained trans in it which unwittingly triggered the tranny until it reached its breaking point

i thought evolution and natural selection was meant to only allow the strongest and smartest to survive     so why the fuck are these mentally ill failures thriving     also i do not support the other side they are just as fucking bad
  i thought evolution and natural selection was meant to only allow the strongest and smartest to survive  its the survival of the fittest
  how are these people fit to survive exactly  the literally have no advantage in life when a worldwide crisis will eventually happen they will be the first to die
  they
  lets see man  if those people were in need do you think they would be on whatever stupid protest they are right now no they would be working instead they are fit to survive just not in need
    fitness is not what you think at all man  a fly a literal maggot is superior to isaac newton because the fly reproduces and newton died a virgin   thats how it works fitness is not an a priori judgement value you cant look at a tall handsome intelligent man and conclude hes fit just because you think hes got the right traits fitness is an a posteriori value that is solely based on whether you have reproduced the moment you successfully reproduce you are fit and you win the game of life and evolution  these people may or may not be fit i dont know if they have offspring
  i thought evolution and natural selection was meant to only allow the strongest and smartest to survive   thats a common misconception from normies fitness is basically how much offspring a being can create
  bitch did you just make up a scenario in your head that you even admit isnt real to support the notion theyre not fit for survival in the real world  threads like these reminds me why i cant be bothered with /sci/ these days
  this board was always filled with retarded teenagers who have no idea what theyre talking about
  its survival of the fit enough not the fittest just look at all the retard species you get on islands without natural predators
  i love eccentricity such an amazing image d
because gene expression is based on your environment
  i thought  wrong
this board is really filled with faggot and degenerate libtard defending those creature
  nice english brainlet faggot
  who care about english retarded mutt
  i thought evolution and natural selection was meant to only allow the strongest and smartest to survive  you think evolution is something that it is not
  t nonwhite scum living in a shithole country tryna talk about degenerate creatures fix yourself first la creatura
  the literally have no advantage in life when a worldwide crisis will eventually happen they will be the first to die  since that still hasnt happen they are alive
  ideas are more important and have a greater impact on society than children    we arent microbes bro we have society and culture and science    all these evolutionary fags trying to justify every human trait in terms of natural selection and genetics are giving bad people an excuse to behave like animals    grow the fuck up
  how does this pack of whatevertheyares not think for one second how fucking utterly embarrassing this group photo is
    at least those people arent virgins unlike op rofl
  go back to your containment board /pol/ faggot
  cringe
  bigger cringe if your post isnt satire youre mentally ill
  we created laws and civilization which often contradicts darwinism
  basically this  if it doesnt seem obvious to you that natural selection stopped applying to humans a long time ago you are literally retarded

  modern medicines ability to keep us alive makes it tempting to think human evolution may have stopped better healthcare disrupts a key driving force of evolution by keeping some people alive longer making them more likely to pass on their genes but if we look at the rate of our dnas evolution we can see that human evolution hasnt stopped  it may even be happening faster than before    yet despite these changes natural selection only affects about 8 per cent of our genome according to the neutral evolution theory mutations in the rest of the genome may freely change frequency in populations by chance if natural selection is weakened mutations it would normally purge arent removed as efficiently which could increase their frequency and so increase the rate of evolution    the human mutation rate itself may also be changing the main source of mutations in human dna is the cell division process that creates sperm cells the older males get the more mutations occur in their sperm so if their contribution to the gene pool changes  for example if men delay having children  the mutation rate will change too this sets the rate of neutral evolution  realising evolution doesnt only happen by natural selection makes it clear the process isnt likely to ever stop freeing our genomes from the pressures of natural selection only opens them up to other evolutionary processes  making it even harder to predict what future humans will be like however its quite possible that with modern medicines protections there will be more genetic problems in store for future generations    
    evolution is the genetic equivilent of throwing shit at the wall and seeing what sticks it doesnt have a purpose in mind
  how much of what you are is memories and social programming literally your entire consciousness is what    take away your consciousness your language your memories your social customs and knowledge and what are you    not even fit to be called an animal every other species would see you as nothing but food from the day you were born    know who is really winning the nameless people who created our system of governance the people who make our laws the people who decide what we get taught at school    the priests of every religion are a close second maybe even first    people who spam babies are only feeding them minds to assimilate

  if an organism survives long enough to pass on its traits then its more or less fit for its environment and its offspring will in turn continue the cycle nothing else matters
  i thought evolution and natural selection was meant to only allow the strongest and smartest to survive  well you thought wrong faggot its just whoever gets to fuck in the end and that could be pretty much any asshole
they are thriving because theres no real threat to their existence in their society they could rub their aids infested testicles on the stairrailings and not face any lethal consequences  however they will most likely die without offspring and have their soul sent to hell where they get assfucked by satan against their will for the rest of eternity while some of us will be chilling in heaven with god who made living life without reproducingsuicide faggotry otaku the greatest sin as it will disrupt his cool experiment
  i thought evolution and natural selection was meant to only allow the strongest and smartest to survive  boy youre stupid      this is also stupid
  t virgin
  thats true but also beside the point  failure to reproduce hasnt lead to any species extinctions though inability to reproduce could have mutations that result in sterility    what youre more referencing is the species reaching reproducing age so say a mutation occurs in a population and about 30 of the population receive the mutation over the next five generations  a new disease enters the population that kills all newborns that dont receive the mutation within a generation only those with the mutation remain they were the fittest if one of those with the mutation doesnt reproduce that doesnt make that member less fit any more than one that dies from an accident before reaching reproductive age    the moment you successfully reproduce you are fit and you win the game of life and evolution  this is not particularly true either if we still use the previous example imagine if the newborns generally survived birth but died within their first five years you successfully reproduced but your offspring are all going to die and your line is going to die out did you win no you lost
is there a list of textbooks / courses that will fully prepare me for the putnam in its entirety
  
  she looks like a retarded chipmunk and has the voice on the same frequency as a dog whistle i honestly dont see the appeal
  putnam is just pure iq no amount of reading textbooks can compensate for being a brainlet
  not entirely a smart person who has never taken any university level math courses wouldnt do that well    yes you need high iq to do well but you also need to go into it with a mathematical utility set of tools
  putnam is just pure iq  raw iq is simply a prerequisite for the putnam  even if youre a genius if you attempt the contest without significant amounts of targeted training you will score like a 30 or 40 on the best possible day you need large amounts of very specialized training  there is a reason mit and harvard hog almost all the winning spots literally every single year
  wow kill yourself emma is pure
  if it were that fucking easy everyone would be a putnam fellow
  theres a whole bunch of previously asked questions online
  putman and beyond book  check last years problems  re read analysisalgebralinear algebra books  geometry problems from imo
  how i wish there was an untimed test where with enough intelligence you would be able to solve even fermats last theorem without help
so are we just going to ignore the fact that these people number anywhere from like 40 to 400 people    forty    what happened to you need at least x number of people for a population to survive the minimum viable population blah blah blah bullshit noone can agree on this number but i always hear a wildly different number from people 70 200 1000 10000 etc etc    imagine being such a wank ass scientist that you get btfo by stone age hunter gatherers
  yeah theyre gonna be super inbred in no time  im assuming a lot of them died off and their population used to be bigger
  nice totally scientific post you moron
something i found    
  yes its horseshit nobody really knows
  just eat the retarded babies eugenics by knife and fork  im just kidding the sentineli dont have forks
  i always hear a wildly different number  and dont care to research the reasons why  protip  resources and habitat
  theres a reason they are still living like animals
  because they eat braaiiinsss
  almost like humans are animals
they guard the ark of the covenant so they are immune to inbreeding just like the jews

  another fav of mine desu
  why
  from what i gather people dont like langs terse style
  most textbooks ive read have been pretty terse so i dont really mind that i also like his definition  theorem  examples style its also a pretty good reference
  its also a pretty good reference  i agree completely i think its better as a reference book than an introductory one
  is this a good textbook for an introduction to linear algebra i have not taken a course in la yet as i had a combined course with ode the books description says its for a second course though
  nope a good linear algebra introduction is finite dimensional vector spaces by halmos
  anal mathematics  does this include the mathematical model of my cock sliding in and out of your moms stinky asshole

  is this a good book for a rigorous introduction to linear algebra im still looking for one senpai
  is this book good
  just read the original work by grassman apparently the way he first published it is still more or less the same way as it is taught now
  yes
  no contest
not a textbook but a compliment to one that saved my gpa more times than i can count
  that book is so surface level i dont know how that can be anyones favorite
  well it covers a lot of stuff and cites further reading
i lost it lads i cant find it fucking anywhere
  it is actually a good introduction for high school students but did you ever make it past org 1
  eh
harris  bertolucci is considered to be the bible of vibrational and electronic spectroscopy by chemists and physicists alike its also written in a really friendly sometimes funny tone which anyone whos ever read quantitative chemical analysis will immediately recognize
ahlfors complex analysis
kreyszig  introduction to functional analysis is the gold standard for me such a clearly written textbook that an undergraduate should be able to grasp the main concepts compared to reed  simon kreyszig is just so lucidly written    i also like ahlfors  complex analysis mostly for the subject matter but also because i appreciate the antiquated connections to geometry i also really liked the textbook quantum probability by stanley gudder    also for shits and giggles stein  harmonic analysis is one of the most difficult texts i have ever read
  i really dont care for kreyszigs diff geo book is that one different
  nice i will have to take a look working on writing a mass spec synthesis engine is your name sam by any chance
yeah i know what a stupid physishit but the half that deals with tensors really helped demystify tensors to me and gave me a good foundation for understanding them from the more algebraic viewpoint instead of the fuckass retarded a tensor is a collection of numbers that transform according to this autistic way  havent checked out the group theory part much though
for me its pugh the best undergraduate analysis textbook
  i kinda like this one it was my cheat code for baby rudin
  yes sam hyde
  ive heard some soviet physics/math textbooks are top tier anybody have experience in this matter
  some of the old dover reprints of russian stuff are still legit like kolmogorovs coauthored functional analysis terminology and approach may be a bit outdated
    dagnab it i cant believe i forgot to mention shilov linear algebra when   already mentioned it and rightly so
russian here     several disciplines were well developed back then including functional analysis complex analysis probability theory and many algebraic fields personally i like pontryagins works on group/representation theory and arnolds various works on differential/symplectic geometry   physics  landaulifshitz is generally viewed as the best course in theoretical physics but from a pedagogical perspective i think its a trap you are either at a level where you can comprehend it and would be better of with introductory english books aimed at undergraduates or you are at a level where you can delve into much more uptodate wrt bith maths in physics literature   nevertheless some outstanding books do exist like faddeev/yakubovskis introduction to quantum mechanics for mathematicians       kolmogorov  might as well go through something readable and useful such as simon/reed russian books are not selfstudycompatible id say
  can comprehend  meant cant obviously
  mass spec not spectroscopy whats a mass spec synthesis engine    no but i have a friend called sam
  havent read that book but yeah i fucking hate pretty much every physics explanation of tensors i dont get why they have to mystify them so much theyre actually incredibly simple when you just view them as multilinear maps on a vector space and its dual then you know exactly what properties they have exactly what sort of inputs to feed it and what all this rstype terminology means from a meaningful level and the whole hurr transformation laws bullshit becomes reduced to i can input dual basis elements to obtain the collection real numbers i can then input dual basis elements of a different basis and obtain a different collection of real numbers obviously theyre the same things but in different bases because thats literally what i just did to obtain them in the first place    on topic heres one of my favorite intro yellow books a classic for sure
  for me its ross
  strange because all the physics courses ive been to and all math for physics books ive read introduce tensors properly and thats in spoiler russia /spoiler where coordinate definitions are still popular but thats theoretical physics and not engineertier physics     lee is good his topological manifolds is also enjoyable
  god tier book
  what if youre not a brainlet and have an understanding of matrices already
  
  which physics books would you recommend for undergraduates
      absolutely shit taste pugh and rudin are the only two books which measure up to a standard of rigor and mathematical maturity and pugh has better exercises and is also fun to read abbott is a meme and rss makes me sick to my stomach
thinking of buying this as i saw it recommended in the wiki i am new to math and is still going through the basics on khan academy     question is this book of value or only meme
  the cost isnt your money but your time 
  worth it
  yes how much math did you learn in school
  this cannot be recommended enough    also heres a very nice intro to representation theory and operator algebras all is done in the finitedimensional setting but it really gives all the important ideas in a very accessible book 
  not much 0 interest now i am almost obsessed
  i love this book never mention it on /sci/ because i thought they would think its for brainlets
  i really cant get into hartshornes book but bredons topology and geometry is amazing imo
  cool i aced my classes so suck my dick /sci/ memelist drone
is this book another russian meme or is it actually good for technical students/engies
  if i recall the diff geo book has a heavy reliance on r3 and is really unmodern in his functional analysis book he takes a decidedly easy approach by nowhere using lebesgue integration but you really dont need it and he makes everything seem so obvious because it is so well written reed  simon in comparison leaves a ton of detail to the exercises and in general the book does not seem like it was written for someone to understand it easily
    i took a differential topology course my first year in grad school with next to zero understanding of topology as such ive always had a negative impression of this book but i bet if i looked back at it i would like it better    also all of the people faculties/students who studied differential geometry at our school were potheads who would just claim shit was obvious and look at me with wide eyes and dilated pupils if i had a question this compared to the number theorists who were fidgety spergs
  you aced childrens calculus while i got the highest grade in my rigorous rudin class at a top university congratulations
    i have no experience on their output but hearsay  i heard they had the best analog spacestation there ever was as such it would not be wasted time to find out how that was achieved    their measuring capabilities in some cases exeeded same cind of digital equipment many times over though that has litle to do with linear math i suspect getting to such equipment must be that the ground work has been solid and easy to understand that was the soviet way at the time there fore i would think such basic level stuff as linear algebra would sertainly be top notch stuff if you can get your hands on 30 years old soviet math literature
  finite dimensional vector spaces    when i took the honors la at my school we used this as a book for the first course it starts of right from the basics of fields and vector spaces and builds up covering a standard course in linear algebra without resulting to using the determinant to prove everything i would recommend it if you already have some background then it should still be a refreshing look at some concepts youre already familiar with
  what is the price range on this 10 20 30 100         i lke this price  the cost isnt your money but your time
  obviously there is that cost in every product discussed here is that somehow more signifigant in this case or just that there is no other price
  of course they will but theyre faggots
looking for a great control systems book ee here looking to go deeper
  no bourbaki  plebeian as usual i see
  yes my name is sam hall and i hate you one and all yes i hate you one and all  damn your eyes
  i dont own a physical copy of it it costs about 70 softcover and 80 hardcover as for all books i would advise to first borrow a copy from the uni library or download it either from linkspringercom if you have institutional access or genlibrusec  at least to see what you put your money into
i am bumping this awesome thread

  shits neat  grew up on genre fiction  grandfather used to take me out on the back porch in darkasfuck rural michigan and taught me the constellations  its good to appreciate the sheer scale of your corner of the cosmos
  face is spake
  just the ludicrous vastness of it like jesus fucking christ
  here physics work math works  out there physics usually work math usually works  some places neither one works or only does with laws and numbers we dont understand  whats up widdat
  its almost as big as my dick so thats pretty neat

has anyone on here used cbd heard it helps with things like anxiety ptsd insomnia and things similar how effective is it really ive looked into a few different companies and a friend recommended one but am still unsure about using it
 go to canada   try it
  not op but thc isnt federally illegal in the states   im from colorado and even i havent tried cbd though
  cbd isnt federally illegal   wew lad
i tried it for a month for anxiety hemp extract didnt notice much of a difference
  how much were u taking
  started at 10mg/day worked my way up to 40 with no noticeable difference
yeah the pure cbd at the store is pretty good its the only cannabis product id buy now     its just like a little sedating and relaxing at small doses higher doses you can get blood shot eyes and a little more sedated
  also pain is more numb at higher doses
  yeah i stopped smoking weed cause of unwanted side effects  thats okay anon used to use xans  trazodone not worried about sedating effects
my friend recommended enlightened organics looks like a small company but its local have any of you used it and what does fullspectum mean
how can this thing work where does it get the energy and timing from how can it function outside of the body
  god hearts are gross
  no u
  no wonder no one gives theirs to you
  heart is design to do this small electrode impulse gets the whole system going walter lewin covers physics of it in 802 lecture 19
  are our hearts always bleeding out like this i guess that blood just gets absorbed by surrounding tissue and back into capillary systems then
  small electrode impulse  yeah where does that come from when its not even connected to the brain
  the heart is highly innervated the medulla oblongata is primarily responsible for regulating heart rate by sending efferent neuroelectrical impulses to the heart
    thats wrong mate the heart works independent of the brain the sinoatrial node can generate its own current look up slow waves by funny receptors ofcourse the brain can affect the heart through sympathetic innervation but the heart can work on its own
  no nothing bleeds that would be internal bleeding which is bad this set up isnt as tight as it would be inside a person
  the brain generally regulates the heart rate normally suppress with it parasympathetic tone from the vagal nerve but within the right atrium there is a small collection of myocytes that are believed to be more leaky than the rest and thus sets the action potential rate for the heart sinoatrial node this sa node generates action potentials which spread across the atria and depolarises it causes contraction of the atria and goes towards the atrioventricular node where the action potential is paused allows for the ventricles to be filled this action potential then travels along to the bundle of his and into the purkinje fibres to innervate the ventricles to contract and push blood into the pulmonary and systemic circulations
  think theyre called funny current channels not receptors if but yeah pre much what you said anon
why does the heart feel pain
  this is all electric where is the source of the electricity and how can it still produce energy outside of the body without being connected to anything
  the blood thats being used is probably fresh hence has sugars atp ions ect    ions provide the electricity sugars/fats provide the energy
  do you understand how action potentials work its hard to understand how the heart works without them basically there is a electrical difference between either side of the cells membranes cells generally have a negative resting membrane potential within the heart there are funny channels which allow for sodium ions to come within the cell and make it more positively charged still negative though until it reaches a threshold and allows for calcium channels to open up the change in ion concentration allows for the channels to open up this calcium inflow depolarises the membrane potential completely and makes it positively charged and as a result spreads across cells since cardiac myocytes are physically desmosomes and chemically gap junctions so depolarisation in one cell and spread down stream to others as an influx of positive ions from the surrounding interstitial space and can cause the cells to reach that threshold again and open up more channels
  this is correct the sa node functions as the pacemaker in a normal heart but every muscle cell in the heart can selfinitiate contraction and send electrical impulses down the heart the heart will effectively beat to the fastest cell in the heart if the sa node fails the next fastest cells in the heart become the default pacemaker usually between 6080 bpm as you descend through the heart the baseline rate of the cells drops the atrial cells have a slightly slower rate than the sa node at the atrioventricular junction the base rate has dropped to 4060 bpm failure of the junction means the pacemaker descends into the ventricles which can have intrinsic rates as low as 15 bpm which is usually fatal    energy is supplied by the blood its pumping the very first arteries supplied by the heart are its own blood supply arteries you can see these on the outside of the heart blockage of those arteries constitutes a heart attack
  what anon said
woke up at 9 am  browse internet a bit drink coffee then go outside to drink coffee while feeling sad about life  have procrastinated doing anything productive in my spare time and giving up junk food for pretty much this entire year hopeful this will change soon  went to a job interview in london on wednesday saw some staceys some gigastaceys and the same locations i always went to when i lived there  saw advert for charles tyrwhitt mens clothes on the underground with its founder and a male model and i felt annoyed because all chads and women get handed everything in life  reading feels more and more like aimless consumercucking  listening to music a lot as well but with that i am a full on pleb feel annoyed that every musician is worshipped as a god    recently got 1400 out of the blue plus im due around 300 in neetbux so despite wasting so much money on daily binges i am easily approaching a comfortable bank balance enough to move back to london when necessary while paying for rent etc and having some spare money  recently passed a job interview for prestigious and ok paying london graduate job which ill start later giving me time to waste without the guilt of thinking im throwing away my life  lots more time for aimless ennui    i didnt do much when i was back in london for the short time i could have walked around as a tourist in a suit feeling that my flaneuring was on a companys expenses but ugly people cant be sad in a profound manner sad ugly beta males like me are like those gore videos you watch out of disgusted curiosity for 5 seconds and then your brain wisely forgets seeing the raw detritus of the universe in the dank evening i went to a high street mcdonalds and it was all so grim i didnt even sit around to drink my mccoffee because i looked like a pathetic ugly loser who had nothing better to do    45 weeks of 40 hours per week at minimum wage an unthinkable amount to work for someone as lazy as me
if i ever have a child i want him/her to become a super genius of great intellectual power who will succeed where i failed if i give the child rigorous exposure to puzzles and mathematics 24/7 with no breaks and constantly supplement him/her with nootropics during his/her infancy would he/she grow up to become a genius with a super high iq
  just feed her well and be a decent father
living vicariously through your child
  who knows
have fun making your child miserable and hate you because youre an insecure retard
  i see your use of he/she and just want to inform you that in this case this is an unneccesary distinction because a she has no hopes of becoming a genius except maybe in the art of sucking phallus  that is all best wishes and i sincerely hope some other fine gentleman answers your question
  lmao nope your experience is just biased xd    just read this   and if you dont like reading articles then read some of the fourteen references
he/she would probably become depressed
  interesting read the studies dont really tell you much though they just followed students fasttracking through school but offered no insight into the actual why or how just theories    tldr  give your child opportunities to learn about things beyond their scope of knowledge so they can improve upon themselves rather than be capped at an educational systems generic levels
  ok this is based
  you would be raising a fuckup youd neuter your childs brain with those chemicals and debilitate them with that diet of information go for it though i dont really see the harm in it since its not my child i would try my best to not raise an autist by widening his scope of interests
  great article      im guessing though a substantial majority of scores on those tests to pick the students is heritable
  any evidence for that position there mrsci skeptic
  if you want your kid to be a genius just wait for gene editing and embryo selection to get advanced enough and select/edit your kids genes as an embryo
  first of all its common sense and the common mule would not dedicate honors to varied interests in some article anyways because they are dingbats but its clear as day if you have any culture in you at all lack of culture leads to autism you would have no depth of understanding outside of math formulas also nootropics cause bad withdrawals and giving regular doses to infants would cripple them its experiment i wouldnt place my bets on
  asks for evidence  its common sense  leave
  needing evidence for every little thing is a sign of autism good luck with that
  sci would be crushed if it found out lady gaga was intelligent enough to consider it full of brainlets

  no iq is genetic
  hit the nail right on the head  as a kid the only freedom i really had was to watch cartoons once maybe every 34 days for like an hour all i ever saw was cute animal characters doing anything they wanted while my dad wouldnt even let me go outside because youre in school even if i had all my work done he would just tell me to study he flunked out of high school and my life was basically nothing except work in the end i wanted to be those cartoon characters do badly that when i hit puberty i only thought of those characters it fucked me up for life in that regard i dont even find humans attractive and i never did because of him
   would he/she grow up to become a genius wiht a super high iq  no theyd be more suicidal than smart    seriously though while iq may be partially influenced by environmental factors iq is mainly based in genetics if youre talking about intelligence as a whole skill sand knowledge then ofc training training them from a young age would help but heres the thing if someone is not naturally interested in what they are being taught and if they are not doing it off their own desire to learn then their learning process will be very very inefficient they will get sick of it they will rebel they will grow to hate education and you tldr pushy parenting does not work    but that doesnt mean trying to foster an interest for science in your children is a bad thing encourage them expose them to intellectual material where they show curiosity and they will do well from that but pushing it onto them will not work     supplement him/her with nootropics during his/her infancy  this is a really bad idea nootropics do not increase intelligence they only increase ability to focus in the short term to help with cognitive performance in the short term this sort of overfocus may actually be harmful to intellectual development and the sideeffects of nootropics are unknown at best dangerous at worse you could potentially damage your child by feeding them nootropics especially while they are still developing     succeed where i failed  anon i think that instead of worrying what travails you should put your future children throuhg that you should rather work on yourself you need not live vicariously through your children you can achieve what you wish them to you just have to work hard and ignore the iqbaiting memes
  one thing to consider is iq is not success in life it predicts it but you need the right environmental setting an oppurtunities studies on heritability look over hundreds or even thousands of people and get a statistical effect over that many people environmental influence evens out but when u look at an individuals life u realise the chain of specific eventa necessary iq is no good in a bad environment and anons article up there showed how their initiative increased success through intervention for high iq kids same could be done with struggling kids too the earlier you tackle a problem the easier it is and people neglect that heritability studies are about individual differences not individual people it doesnt mean it cant be affected especially at young ages
  a good thing to learn is heritability does not equal malleability and neither does environment since environmental things may have long influences over you
  in all honesty its likely that the reason you fucked up was largely partly to do with you sharing the same genes as your dad
every time i force poop out i have a fear of pooping my intestines    is this biologically possible

is there ever going to be a cure for hypothyroidism it sucks if i miss a day of my thyroxine supplements i feel like death    i remember before i got diagnosed i think i was around 16 i would sleep in school come home from school and sleep for an hour or two still feel tired after a long sleep and just have incredibly low energy my mother initially thought it was just tiredness from school but it eventually happened so often she brought me to the doctor to get tested
  wireless devices cause hypothyroidism unless you have solidly confirmed hashimotos this has been observed for the last 70 years    at my last job i wore a bluetooth ring scanner around my finger where did it spend most of its time right next to my thyroid and right orbital i was also surrounded by wifi and cell phones all the time and im someone who previously had minimal exposure and didnt really use any of that stuff    when i was tested  free t4 012 ng/dl ref 089  176  total t3 025 ng/dl ref 060  181  goiter had developed right side of my thyroid nearest the bluetooth emitter was larger but the left side had a nodule fortunately i knew what was likely causing this and quit immediately within two weeks my thyroid function was normal goiter eventually disappeared in fact my thyroid propbably resumed function quickly enough that the levothyroxine made me feel sick and strung out i only took it for a few days theres nothing mysterious or spooky about this it has a solid and well established base in the literature i acted accordingly    so i cant tell you if your thyroid will ever reverse with cessation of exposure but id say eat some bladderwrack or take an iodine supplement stop drinking fluoridated water eliminate goitrogens like onions spinach or millet from your diet all i can tell ya    my mother has hashimotos her levels are fine she takes bladderwrack and immunomodulatory herbs and i could call her and ask more about that if you want
  like onions  damn wordfilter thats soy to be clear
  and i could call her and ask more about that if you want  and just in case your answer is nah i dont give a damn what you have to say i want to make it known that a key part of attenuating or eliminating hashimotos is fixing the gut there are a number of proteins with structural similarity to thyroid related stuff and in the case of poor bile and stomach function and leaky gut your body will mount a response to these partially digested proteins and then go on to attack the thyroid gluten and gliadin i believe have these characteristics and there are a few others

  do you have any actual response to what i said why should anyone take you seriously on a board about science no less    look op i got lucky and had the background and exposures to protect myself and remove the causes from my life while it was still reversible i dont know the exact mechanics but i assume its just extreme exhaustion of the thyroid as my tsh remained elevated or it can also be hypothalamic  pituitary mediated suppression in which case your tsh wont rise as it should you should determine reversibility for yourself i know if i get around intense 4g lte signals or bluetooth i start getting the cold clammy feeling in my entire body my skin tingles and i start getting that rushed highly aggressive speedy feeling the latency for this response is 40 minutes of consistent exposure it indicates the thyroid is becoming overactive naturally such activity must exhaust eventually    good luck dont mind these people they dont know what theyre talking about and even if i furnished them with the proper documents theyd find some way to worm out of it or just go mysteriously quiet seen it before    this is your life good luck
    pseuds calling other pseuds pseuds for pseuding pseuds pseuds
  seen it before  aka youve spammed them before and got told so you sulked off to another thread to start again
  i see youd rather try to shift the conversation to me than engage with the topic
  i heard lllt can stimulate your thyroid at least if you can get enough penetrance to actually reach the thing
  at my last job i wore a bluetooth ring scanner around my finger where did it spend most of its time right next to my thyroid and right orbital  that doesnt make any sense what the fuck were you doing with your arms
4chan wont let me post but heres a link to the text version and the relevant literature        scanning rows of things that were generally eye level or required a posture that kept it at eye level keeping your hand near your neck was the basic intermediary position
  oh okay i imagined some sort of keycard thing that would be rarely used    by the way what do you think of lllt i asked you yesterday but never got a reply
  was it in that psychology / climate change thread i started to respond to some of those posts but was too tired looks like it 404d    lllt  i dont know much about it thats in the realm of biophotonics which ive been meaning to look into more a lot of research especially in russia where they were openly into kirlian photography esp and so forth dating back to the late 1800s identified that cells do emit highly coherent bursts of uv to ir light and that this does modulate the behavior of neighboring cells a number of papers were published in the 30s i believe stemming from a report showing chickpea root tips when exposed could transmit a disease state to other exposed root tips when a block of quartz was put between them when it was ordinary glass it didnt work showing uv was necessary i dont remember the author    theres a lot of research showing benefits of infrared saunas as well and theres a good physical basis to expect some sorts of transduction of those frequencies by structures in the skin    so i dont know much about it but would believe it probably does something havent heard anything specifically in reference to thyroid function
  i think it was in the thread with the antenna against the sky as the op picture dont quite remember the actual subject right now aside from your favorite field on lllt there seems to have been a lot of studies and basically no averse effects if you stick to rare instead of well done dosages of course along with a slew of positive effects doubt theres much corruption either because unlike radio and wifi this stuff really doesnt have much use aside from this relatively new subfield of medicine
  it does seem to have a lot of promise and also relates with health implications of technologies like lifi intelligent development of artificial lighting everything except incandescent lights is proving to be damaging    imagine if we were constantly being forcefully exposed to devices that were actually net good for you in reasonable doses though the ideal is something completely inert which the ussr attempted to ensure was the case for which they were subtly mocked by the who in 1982 recently the rncnirp petitioned the who working group on rf to reevaluate their stance on rf citing the extensive data that had accumulated globally in addition to the historical russian data their response was what youd expect a large amount of the research being done on biophotonics bioelectromagnetics etc is based in russia to this day though at a far reduced level    people need to realize what the who is and stop trusting this political sham of an organization the who is nato and multinational interest period
  wait led lamps are proving to be damaging in what manner most of the consumer grade lllt devices are led lamps because lasers are too expensive does this have to do with visual effects i bought a led lamp for my bed a few months ago and it has this obnoxious strobe effect something about the outlet or whatever being a mismatch which i can clearly tell is bad for me so i only use it for a few seconds at a time when trying to orient me in the darkness from my bed
  intense blue light / leds suppress melatonin synthesis and generate ros in the eye leading to various types of damage notably the mode of cell death is necrosis    its probably also doing something else in the brain with circadian related stuff because signs of neurodegeneration appear with prolonged and consistent exposure it seems beyond an intensity threshold blue light triggers a state of increased functionality meant for a certain window of time during midday which the brain cant really sustain beyond how it would naturally occur with the exception of the occasional full moon apparently this is true with fluorescents as well                        changes the behavior of microorganisms      concerning the magnetic fields dimmable leds transformers etc      some papers showed the lower color temperature lights arent so bad but i dont really trust them either way in the case of vehicles with these obnoxious leds in your back window theyre definitely harming the driver and altering their behavior when the road is eventually made solely of these headlights driving at night will be damaging to everyones eyes say nothing of your melatonin cycle    conveniently in my area in the space of a few days or so theyve also replaced all street lights with these led units they have a cone thing on top i looked up the manufacturer of the part and apparently its just a photo sensor but i dont buy it
  we had tiny photosensors that could also power a calculator decades ago now suddenly a simple sensor needs to be this huge cone and it doesnt even work right ive seen them turn on when a cloud went over    one idea is that they are photosensors but theyre intended to sense blackbody radiation etc to network together and construct 3d images of an environment they may be omnidirectional antennas for other frequencies though i dont have a meter to test if theyre emitting anything i dont think they have anything to do with 5g and if they do the connection is going to be wireless as so far they arent connected to anything other than the power lines    things are moving very fast i live in a rural area and theyre laying fiber optic lines day and night have brought in several contractors suddenly changes are on a timescale of minutes not weeks
    two of those articles are the same a couple of them are pretty bad and the rest either use rather high sar in the tests or arent very conclusive in their results    certainly not enough there to be attributing any particular case of hypothyroid to cellphones or wireless devices
  cite specifics and also sar is a poor measure thats also easy to manipulate also dont ignore the first half of that sentence and double down on the second i expect specifics if im going to invest time in a conversation just letting you know    did you read the warsaw symposium or ussr literature
  im gonna make a bigger reply in a while i think but its interesting to note that most lllt led devices ive looked up are actually minding their electric/magnetic fields and trying to keep them to a minimum
  is there ever going to be a cure for hypothyroidism it sucks if i miss a day of my thyroxine supplements i feel like death  i dont get this how would a cure be different from just taking thyroxine is it just that you dont like taking a tablet once a day and how would you even forget to take a drug like that when you know you have hypothyroidism and will feel like shit without it that sounds like the sort of thing youd remember before most any other part of your daily routine since its for a major medical problem and you have horrible negative feedback from skipped doses reinforcing its importance
  type 1 diabetes  i dont get this how would a cure be any different than just tracking what you eat taking your blood sugar and administering insulin and how would you even forget to take a drug like that when you know you have type 1 diabetes and will feel like shit suffer nerve damage and have seizures without it that sounds like the sort of thing youd remember before most any other part of your daily routine since its for a major medical problem and you have horrible negative feedback from skipped doses reinforcing its importance    seriously why would anything ever not going according to plan why wouldnt you just be perfect just learn to take your pills and stop bitching you stupid brat
  except thats bullshit thyroxine is just a tablet you take in the morning not insulin injections and a highly volatile blood sugar level that you need to constantly check  and have you seen what elderly people take each day    researchers estimate that 25 percent of people ages 65 to 69 take at least five prescription drugs to treat chronic conditions a figure that jumps to nearly 46 percent for those between 70 and 79 doctors say it is not uncommon to encounter patients taking more than 20 drugs to treat acid reflux heart disease depression or insomnia or other disorders  also chronic disease maintenance drugs like balsalazide even when being the only thing you take can still end up requiring ridiculous amounts like 9 large capsules per day    adultsthree 750milligram mg capsules three times a day for a total daily dose of 6750 mg
  also    a tsh blood test should be obtained at least every 612 months while you are on a stable thyroxine dose and more often if your dose is changed  so you can fuck right off with that dishonest comparison to diabetes diabetics are drawing blood from their fingers daily not exactly the same thing as having your thyroid level checked once a year during a routine doctors appointment
  and have you seen what elderly people take each day  unfortunately yes    so more or less you either have really seen it or you take many pills per day and why wouldnt you just be perfect just learn to take your pills and stop bitching you stupid brat    im not intending to respond in a dismissive way but i think youre being a bit ridiculous he developed some bullshit when he was 16 and wants to get rid of it and youre saying get used to it kiddo thats the gist of it it aint that complex because its an age old dynamic hes going to get used to it eventually no matter what any of us say if he has to    except in the case that its reversible and he tries what i suggested with success    so you can fuck right off with that dishonest comparison to diabetes  its relatively accurate i had a friend who developed type 1 diabetes when he was 10 or so from the small bit of ops frame of mind that we can see hes having similar thoughts
why the fuck does wetlab work have to be a thing of the past drylab basis is so fucking boring would have been better to have be born years ago before the process of wetlabs being phased out began
tfw you will never live in a technocratic monastery full of people who dedicate their lives to learning and practicing their field  tfw you will never create a modern secret equivalent of the knights templar
work vs research grants  brainlet here explain why anyone would prefer the former like what the fuck is the point
  research grants are highly competitive and funding tends to be corrupt you have to be friendly with someone who organises funding
  monastery  technocratic  not starting a mages guild    pathetic
  we tried that in the dark ages remember they went full zealot and paladin mode and destroyed every guild even the white mages died although the black magicians just did what they always did and cunningly bunked underground lmao in the end they did more harm than good because they destroyed more white mages than black
  isolation leads to stagnation
  if you want to go fast go alone if you want to go far go together if you want to go far and fast make a hierarchy
  explain what you said
  abloo bloo pppppfffff
  its lonely at the top yet cohesive and together
  this means literally nothing to me either buy me a drink or stop wasting my time
  implying  you could always just play eye peasant
  lol no get fucked retard
  it doesnt unless you are ironically in an isolated group
  t avid nature documentary viewer  i know your game you pull the same shit here every week with these dumb broads
  neat makes sense
  i think places like ias and ihes are the closest to what you have in mind
  you know you can literally just group together with eleven or more other people and found a catholic monastic order focusing on whatever right    but know the perennial risk of monasticism  secular powers will always try to kill you and take your stuff
imagine living amicably with the most brilliant men and women around the world in a secluded institute on the mountains working on theoretical research with all of your financial needs taken care of imagine marrying another researcher and growing old after making several contributions to science acting as a father figure to younger researchers    you will never experience this
  watch closely
youll never create an underground facility dedicated to creating androids after a nuclear holocaust either
  thats the whole point of a nuclear holocaust
  whats stopping you nuclear war isnt hard to trigger
  yes it does suck my dick bitch
    isnt that basically a university     also where are you going to get funding for whatever cutting edge insightful revolutionary research you intend to do all the low hanging fruit has already been taken after all and often nowadays significant research entails multilab collaborations
  i am testing
  if you want to go fast go alone    only if youre a true genius otherwise youre just being arrogant and wont progress as fast as if you had help    if you want to go far go together     unless youre a genius of course otherwise collaborating is par for the course and doesnt necessarily mean success anyway    if you want to go far and fast make a hierarchy    which may entail stagnation and bureaucratic crap  see how may arab nation armies work    did you think you were being insightful or clever with that statement
i thought id make up a thread and eventually a guide on healthy living to maintain sanity and mental health while doing 50 hours a week what i do so far  friday night 1 hour swim session  10 minutes in the sun whenever possible  salad at least once a week  200g of spinach at least once a week  soup at least once a week   eat whole wheat bread 5/7 times a week  no sugar no sweet stuff  thats about it what do you guys do all tips and ideas welcome    pic for inspiration
why no weightlifting
  resistance training is not healthy at all endurance training is healthy
  eat salad  im healthy
  what about fruits and vegetables just one exercise session per week
postgrad hustling   kek  just do the damn research and get your degree pray that you have a good supervisor with connections to help you get inside the circlejerk of academia
  get enough sleep
if people are pale skinned because of vitamin d then how do you explain the fact that tasmanianspic related who lived in a temperate climate similar to that of britain were dark skinned    simple the vitamin d hypotheses is absolute garbage     science is the generation of novel facts from risky predictions and so hypotheses that predict novel facts from risky predictions are scientific hypotheses whereas those hypotheses that need to continuously backtrack and think up adhoc hypotheses are then pseudoscientific     vdh is a pseudoscientific hypotheses    here is a paper showing other flaws in the vdh that we today teach to our kids at school as a fact       you can have access to the full paper with scihub
  racial science is faulty  color me surprised
  ask yourself a simple question  is there something the scientists that have formal training in this specific subject know that you dont
  why do you think im here to show how much knowledgeable i am to the users of a japanese forum then you are wrong    im here to know if there are things that i didnt consider so if th    and talking about scientists with formal training did you read the paper i sent that btfo vdh
  mutations are random evolving to is factually incorrect popsci notion   evolution is only driven by a handful of things like survival of the fittest and sexual selection the mutations that arise are not a directed process but entirely random to think two very unique mutations would emerge at different corners of the globe simultaneously just because of climate differences is just a pisspoor understanding of how evolution and mutation occurs moreover most mutations are passed by if there was a paleskin he would have been seen as a freak and probably would not have much mating success and that rare 1/10000000000000 mutation would have been died with him study genetics and evolution more
  mutations are random  dna is a fractal antenna and its coiling behavior affects susceptibility to mutation of a given segment for the germ line there are more complexities so this is incorrect even something as simple as electron transport in the dna molecule can have major effects on expression and mutation probability    we might well have the means to become many things relatively quickly in response to environmental changes an organism that wasnt structured this way would be more likely to die out    also you look at genes that supposedly changed naturally and many of them just have a stop codon thrown in the middle eg cmah its all very strange
  ow do you explain the fact that tasmanianspic related who lived in a temperate climate similar to that of britain were dark skinned  huge differences in british and tasmanian climate one such relevant difference is briant as about 1/3 less sunlight measured as sunshine hours which doesnt really account for intensity differences its also 10 degrees closer to the equator   science is the generation of novel facts from risky predictions   no its not   and so hypotheses that predict novel facts from risky predictions are scientific hypotheses  so still no   whereas those hypotheses that need to continuously backtrack and think up adhoc hypotheses are then pseudoscientific  and continued no dont make up definitions and then use it to smear whatever you dont like    long and short of it pigmentation effects on vitamin d production is one of several things that influence pigmentation the paper you post is right in that its ludicrous to say this one thing is why whyte people are white but that doesnt mean its bullshit
  dont make up definitions and then use it to smear whatever you dont like  i didnt make up a definition end    here be my sources      
  tasmania is on the 41st parallel latitude south thats equivalent to where spain is in the north since the tasmanians had comparable darkness to spaniards see op figure there is no contradiction
  fine dont use shitty definitions from sources and then use it to smear whatever you dont like
  diet anon diet
  its all just founder effect bro
  latitude  sunlight  new york state is colder than all of western europe yet it receives similar sunlight to italy and spain
  that sounds complex and inconvenient
  not for a sith
  its not similar to that of britain you retard and there may not have been there long could easily displace the previous population as they had displaced another
  cant you get vitamin d from fish and i think meat
guess who lives in tasmania now motherfucker thats right white brits looks like evolution won out in the end
in 1978 nasa launched the total ozone mapping spectrometer in 1998 anthropologist nina jablonski and her husband george chaplin collected spectrometer data to measure uv radiation levels around the world and compared it to published information on the skin colour of indigenous populations of more 50 countries the results showed a very high correlation between uv radiation and skin colour the weaker the sunlight was in a geographic region the lighter the indigenous peoples skin were    jablonski went on to prove that people living above the latitudes of 50 degrees have the highest chance of developing vitamin d deficiency     the main island of tasmania lies between 40s and 44s latitude  the latitude of london uk is 51509865    maybe this
like one anon said mutations are random but still need some prerequisites people there just werent lucky
  the largest consumer of vitamin d in the human body is the brain a more complex brain  more vitamin d needed  higher pressure to evolve light skin
why 0  1
  because (((maths))) is a scam
  because the number of ways to arrange the null set is 1  you could have googled this though so youre a bitch
you can one arrange 0 into 1 configuration
      if n  nn1     then 0  00  1   
  n / nn1    n  n1  n  this is just a case of simple algebra for the proof its insanely trivial
  nn1 and n1n  is the same exact thing senpai
  go to bed joe
  i actually want to know why since im spending my time into proofs would you mind to explain why there is a difference
  nn1  n2  n  / n1  n  example 551  54  20 / 5  511  5
  i dont need to know why its enough for me that when i type 01 into the javascript console it says the result is true  thats proof for you right there
  whoops the 511 should be 51
  holy shit youre retarded
  using n  nn1  1  10
  you just made proof of why exactly the product is commutative
  shit i meant him 
  decreasing energy increases the empty set of a set most undergrads learn this in their 2nd year
  factorial is taken to be the nonnegative integer restriction of a shift of the gamma function which is an integral the reason we take it to be this specific function instead of some other is because it is the analytic continuation of factorial and its meromorphic on the complex plane and gamman  n1 while gamma1  1 so it makes sense to define 0  1  the reason this is useful is because almost any series representation of a function/constant which is written using factorial has the n0 first term to have a 1 where all the other terms have an n so letting 0  1 is consistent across pretty much any math youll do  in fact gamma is defined for all nonpositive integers where it has poles so defining 0  001 doesnt even make sense since 01  gamma0 which is a pole and can be interpreted as infinity so 0  0infinity which of course is an indeterminate and can assume 1 in the limit
  01  it says true because assertions returns true if they go right    also it should return some error code
  it is not an assertion its a simple expression  it returns true because the result of the inequality operator  with the operands 0 and 1 is true
  the absolute state of computer scientists
      welp i messed up  now im gonna hang myself
0 is null set i didnt knew it was empty set i tough it was an identity
  why do you think its called science you do empirical experiments with the computer instead of trying to solve problems with some kind of abstract theory
  we computer scientist know shit like dmorgan law anon we are fucking superior
  actually most undergrads learn this in the first week of their first year you must have gone to a special community college or something lol
  gamma function
  because its useful and xy is just dependent on some definition
  why not
the binary opposite of 0 is 1  i regret nothing by saying this
  hes le epic trolle you  is not equals 0 is not equals 1 is true
  implying the gamma function and factorial are the same thing
its a conventionthe sum of 0 items is 0 the product of 0 items is 1 no reason except that it makes making formulas easier
  1 is undefined
    n  nn1 is valid only for n0
its not a convention if you start from a set theoretic definition the factorial function can be defined as the cardinality of the set of bijective functions from a set of cardinaility n to itself now the only set that has cardinality 0 is the empty set so how many bijective functions can you make from the empty set to itself the idea here is to understand that a function its defined formally as a relation of two sets that satisfies certain conditions so like anything in a set theoretical construction a function is a set itself ie if you have sets mathab/math a function is a subset of mathatimes b/math  but because mathemptysettimesemptyset  emptyset/math the only possible subset is the empty set itself which trivialy satisfies the properties of a function now that doesnt mean the set of bijections is itself the empty set the empty set is a function itself so the set is actually mathemptyset/math ie the set that contains as its only element the empty set so the cardinality is 1
  the gamma function is the analytic continuation of factorials
  theyre not the same thing though saying that theyre the same thing is like saying  mathsum_n1infty nfrac112/math
  but factorial is literally defined by the gamma function  imagine being this uneducated
  you dont have a reason to say that summation is wrong you just dont like it
  i do have a reason though 1  1 1  2  3 1  2  3  6 now take the limit of that sequence what is it 1/12 what kind of fuckways topology of the reals are we using here
  thats a bad reason tho  1 is an integer  2 is an integer  3 is an integer  now take the limit  infinity is an integer
  induction only proves things for the set of natural numbers it doesnt prove anything for infinity    step 1 add 10 balls labeled 1 to 10 into a container remove ball 1  step 2 add 10 balls labeled 11 to 20 into a container remove ball 2    for all finite steps the number of balls increases without bound    if you do it infinitely often however there are 0 balls in the container    all sorts of things are discontinuous at infinity
    im not using infinite induction im using the literal definition of infinite series in case you didnt know its the epsilondelta limit of partial sums
  its easy to confuse yourself with this shit but its quite simple     all that the ramanujan summation stuff cutoff and zeta regularization does is look at the smoothed curve at x  0   what sums usually do is look at the value as xinf     its just a unique value you can assign to a sum really they have many such values        math displaystyle  zeta neq sigma  /math    
  did i disagree
  im using the literal definition of infinite series    no you are using _a_ definition youre using the only definition you like    partial sum is intuitive but thats it its not better than the other definitions you can just understand what its saying easier
  dipshit youre supposed to be wrong thats how internet arguments are supposed to work why arent you fucking wrong
lets say you have a series math a  a_0 a_1  a_2  a_3  /math  if you were trying to increase the rate of convergence then you might look at the partial sums  math  a_0  a_0  a_1  a_0  a_1  a_2    /math  and youd say why not look at these partial sums instead    math  a_0  frac12a_1  a_0  a_1  frac12a_2  a_0  a_1  a_2  frac12a_3  /math    if the first one converges then so does this new one but this new sequence works really really well for alternating series and if you try grandis series you get    math    1  frac121  frac12  1  1  frac121  frac12  1  1  1  frac121  frac12      /math    so now grandis series is equal to mathfrac12/math    and thats why you dont only use one definition because improving the ones you have is really useful        oh fuck sorry dude uhhh what about niggers are good for society
  nigga im a biochemist and i know de morgans law
  very elegant i like it next time smartass freshmen ask me this question ill pull this one out      the set with 0 elements in it is   the empty set
  you knew what he meant why be an asshat
  because their is only one way to arrange zero things
  that rests on the assumption that 01111  1/2 does it not that means that whatever operation you are using it is no longer strictly summation
  thats actually a pretty meaningless statement define arrange
  that means that whatever operation you are using it is no longer strictly summation  yeah but using zfc addition is defined in terms of cardinalities of sets so adding anything besides non negative integers is also no longer strict summation    but strict summation is just another name for partial sums which is just _a_ definition anyway not the best definition
  low iq
its defined as such
  yeah its kinda like asking why 1  1  0
  lol what a retard
  5  3  2  5  3  53  the absolute state
  math displaystyle   sum_n1 infty n   dfrac112  /math  optimized
    if n nn1  then 111110    we agree for 01    so that there is a condition that stops the recursion  whole formula is    n nn1 for n0  1 for n0    note the definition for n0 would make it go to infinity
  inb4 what do you mean by we peasant
  but those two are the same thing by any reasonable definition of same i mean do you use a separate symbol for finite and infinite summation for conditionally and unconditionally convergent series see where im going here
  its not a science
  lol youre so dumb
  for anyone whos wondering the correct answer is this
  youre right that 123 doesnt converge to 1/12 but so what theres a very real sense in which 123 is 1/12 we dont artificially distinguish between conditional and unconditional convergence for example even though the former is not invariant to rearrangements
    kek
  note the definition for n0 would make it go to infinity  which is exactly what the gamma function does
i can solve these problems with steps and everything please    srry for my english
order of division is ambiguous   reapeated fractions a/b/c could be interpreted as both a/bc or ac/b
take the whole fractional numerator and keep it the way it is then change the big fraction bar to multiplication and then the huge bottom fraction flip it    then factor a out of the polynomial and then factor the polynomial then you can probably cross simplify     it has been awhile since i have solved such an expression since i teach middle school math but using concept knowledge is your biggest ally
  if you do those steps right a b and a1 should cancel out from your original expression this is just me doing it in my head so i could be wrong i believe the answer should be 1/a2 1
is it safe should it be banned due to their marketing towards children does nicotine increase focus
  degenerate
  pic  cringe
  dumb nicotine will give you ed
  is it safe  somewhat   the cardiovascular load of pure nicotine is stronger than that of smoked tobacco maois and no increase from tobacco smoke attenuates nicotines vasoconstrictory and hypertensive effect  the pg/vg carrier in evaping devices can capture saliva and pathogens from the throat and mouth and cause it to migrate deeper into the lungs this is a good reason not to use the giant faggot box mods like this  mouth breather and instead use high nicotine per hit to minimize the amount of other junk in the ecig tobacco is still king  should it be banned due to their marketing towards children   this is a loaded question that implies they are marketing to children to begin with no  does nicotine increase focus  yes see pic related  whats the /sci/ consensus on vaping  it looks retarded but can be beneficial
  any source on that claim
  tobacco is still king    i thought smoking cigs causes cancer
  you thought wrong dont use commercial cigarettes with additives filters and fsc though roll your own
  wtf i want to start vaping now just because of that aesthetic juul has  ive never smoked anything in my entire life
  it doesnt matter what you do you fucking moron you are inhaling combusted plant matter
  smoke bad  straw man that ignores what combusted plant matter is your low iq emotional reaction is on full display in your post you only offer this up because it sounds icky and disgusting the human lung indeed the lungs of all mammals evolved over hundreds of millions of years to filter out particulate matter and if you look at the constituents with the combusted plant matter youll find that most are harmless lightweight organic molecules which are readily excreted by the body and among these there is a plenitude of beneficial substances eg coenzyme q10 numerous polyphenols increased gsh production that more than compensate for whatever oxidative stress is inflicted by any irritants within the smoke
  the lungs of all mammals evolved over hundreds of millions of years to filter out particulate matter  go breath in volcanic ash lets see how good our lungs are at filtering that significant of an amount
  filtering out sparse background particles is not the fucking same as directly inhaling burning shit
i absolutely cannot stand this faggotry i dont give a shit if its safe or not if you do this youre a faggot full stop
  ooooga boooga burning shit  the post applies to your reply here too    thanks for further proving my point tobacco is miniscule in comparison and certainly does not inflict any perceptible unpleasantry in the lung people can smoke without much injury or detriment and if you analyze the constituent the case could be made with great benefit
  wew kinda wish i fell for the smoking meme
  its not too late
  its literally tar how can that not be bad for your lungs and its a shame because smoking looks so cool
  sadly im not that interested in cigarettes or tobacco since im kinda too poor for higher quality stuff right now  maybe vaping can be just as good az least for nicotine delivery i was meaning to try vaping for other reasons for some time now but never planned on including nicotine
  microthrombosis  bronchiolitis obliterans
quitting smoking was the best thing i ever did  i can breathe properly now  nicotine is a poisonous drug
  dose makes the poison and nice n1 to offer my own taking up smoking immensely improved my life
  imagine posting this and not receiving a paycheck from marlboro
the chad einstein  smoke like a chimney revolutionize physics  the virgin /sci/ poster  refuse nicotine for health reasons masturbate to anime
  im convinced what brands of cigs will give me higher iq
i picked up smoking because i was suicidal and tring to see if a new addiction could throw off my addiction to pornography and marijuana    it didnt i just ended up chainsmoking for 2 years until i was constantly coughing up black then i switched to a juul i like it fuck people that hate vapes theyre even bigger faggots than the people buying the mods
does objective truth exist
yes climate change for example
  yes but we are incapable of perceiving it
define truth
  truth  that which is     objective truth  that which is and cannot be otherwise
  no the world doesnt truly exist you are just a universal subjective currently dreaming and this will never end after this life you will have another dream and another it is just a subjective and nothing else
  how do you know when something satisfies those terms
i just dont fucking get how maths cant be objective and yet the idea of objective truth simultaneously makes no sense to me    is it possible to argue against 224
  this
  every piece of information that we interpret is through the prism of our subjective experience using your example there is no way for any of us to be 100 sure that 224 what if our senses are deceiving us every single time you or i try to perform the operation     there is no way to prove that my senses are accurately reflecting reality  which is why we must use unjustified axioms or else theres no point trying to apply logic to anything
  there is no way for any of us to be 100 sure that 224  but there is how the fuck could it not be  225 objectively makes no sense prove me wrong
  cogito ergo sum sounds pretty true to me  if you feel like splitting hairs about the semantics of that something exists is about as close to an absolutely certain objective truth as we can get
  i dont know what your post is saying
  22 cannot equal five it must equal 4 in every instance
  your senses are accurately deceiving you every time so the result is objective while the result is consistent maybe tomorrow 2  2  8 and then it will be objective for that state our senses are a function that remains constant while it does to process all other functions
  why
  because it cannot be otherwise where would the extra 1 come from
  the thinking mind obviously exist by the axiom of consciousness the universe youre percieving is something rather than nothing so it must also exist by the axiom of existence after that you can only make probabilistic approximations through collection of new information
  yes but you have to think in terms outside of linear thinking
      consider this  to what value does 4 come from we all know 2  2  4 but can we really prove it without making circular logic overall we know its equal to 4 because we were raised to know it was 4 but can we really say its 4 without the subjective experience  was talking about
  why wouldnt it be 4 if you take 2 coins and another 2 coins then put them next to each other you have 4 coins
  but this is based on an unjustified axiom there is no way to 100 epistemologically be certain that this holds true
  i had a professor tell me it comes from the addition itself
  then what are the alternatives
  what if in reality when you put 2 coins next to another 2 coins together 1 automatically disapears  it sounds silly but there is no way to actually know this isnt the case
  but if its been true 100 of the time up to this point what epistemic excuse do we have for thinking that 224 would ever not be true
  math isnt a sensory based a posteriori thing its an a priori thing  your argument is a case against science not math empiricism/science can never give us truth or knowledge only math can
  then why assume 224 if theres no objective justification how can it be justified because its useful    what does useful mean how do we measure it without some objective frame of reference
  then that function isnt 22 but 2  2  1
    its not a matter of what i think is possible/likely to be true its just recognizing the limits of our knowledge how can i be sure that the universe didnt just come into existence 3 second ago i literally cant
  math is built off of unjustified axioms  we view it through the prism of our experience so it can never give us objective truth
  no we write down some axioms for convention the axioms we right are still external to us   math is not a posteriori that we have before added or removed certain axioms for different subfields of math doesnt mean the axioms are arbitrary
  how can you be sure you cant be sure thats just a conclusion youve reached which could really be the fault of some evil demon tricking you    see how gay that line of thinking is put down descartes
  im not saying that people should think that way it would be fucking retarded to go around in life acting as if i lived in the matrix or something as i said its recognizing the limits of our knowledge and understanding that everything we perceive in the world is inherently through the lens of our own subjective experience      axioms are by definition unjustified if they make sense in our subjective reality there is nothing to say they hold true objectively again im not arguing that we should just give up because we cant know anything  i was just responding to op by pointing out that we are incapable of being 100 confident that we are perceiving objective truth
  it would be fucking retarded to go around in life acting as if i lived in the matrix or something  why
  probably wouldnt end up well
  why
  youd probably do something stupid
nah the object/subject distinction of kant is no longer useful all truth is fallible the best we can do is pragmatism
  mathematical patterns in nature such as 1618 etc i guess you could classify this as objective truth since its objectively measurable miauw idk jkkk xddd
      think about it like this the axioms we write down arent the things that give us the math the math already exists objectively and externally to us and then we write down a finite set of statements that are able to capture a very large but ultimately finite subset of that infinite set of math that exists externally to us    this is what godel proved there is always a countably infinite set of true statements that can never be proven with a finite set of axioms that doesnt mean that these unprovable but true statements dont exist or that they only begin to exist when we write down a set of axioms that encapsulate them it just means we can not ever capture all truth with a finite set of rules it also doesnt mean the truth we can capture is arbitrary     to really cement this in your thinking just think about it like this this universe and its laws of physics etc are not the most fundamental they are just a finite subset of the infinite set of math that objectively exists in the ideal realm this universe is an applied version of a small finite subset of the eternal math
  why
  this is a question for  and the possible answers are all unsettling to accept
subjective truth is an oxymoron and objective truth is redundant so your question is whether truth exists or not well suppose it doesnt is the proposition truth does not exist true or false
you might think that 112   there is always the possibility however unlikely that 115 actually equals 5 and that our mathematical reasoning or interpretation of numbers is flawed at the biological level where the noumenal becomes phenomenonal after all we dont directly precieve mathematical enities like numbers we interpert them from signs
  doesnt mean that these unprovable but true statements dont exist or that they only begin to exist when we write down a set of axioms     but quantum physics says they begin to exist upon observation so in a way
  cus you think youre in the matrix
  this universe isnt the most fundamental as i said so superposition doesnt have relevance to the proven results of godel incompleteness theorem  the laws of qm are just another finite set of laws within the infinite set of math in the ideal realm
  there is no such thing as subjective truth
you literally cant prove 224 go ahead try bertrand russell had a go and the effort turned him into a woodpecker and he still failed
tfw you realise there is no truth and all the supposedly intelligent maths geniuses have been wasting their lives on a lie  stupid eggheads
  didnt he prove 112
  the fundamental being the ideal realm you mentioned earlier
  its selfevident
  nope     for you to me god is self evident
  philosophy btfo
  philosophical statement  philsophy btfo
  no truth no philosophy
definitions are true by definition   all of science is just models though none of it is true
  thats not what that post was about dummy
  yup just realised  im a fucking moron
its about to get real /his/ in here but this thead really does belong there so ill continue anyways    hericlitus said that the essence of the universe is constant change that it is because it isnt if we take this to be true we cannot know anything because the laws of the universe itself are subject to change and we cannot even know so much as a true/false statement the basis of logic itself things at a quantum level seem to act more like this and the fact that they act different at a quantum level than at a higher more classical level says quite a bit in itself    parmenides simply said that it is and if we do not take this base assumption than we cannot even so much as be certain of a true/false statement the basis of logic itself however if we take all the baggage that logically comes with saying that it is we get the parmenidian solid an allencompassing unchanging existance which must contain literally everything be completely connected unmoving and unchanging parmenides coming to this conclusion is said to have gone mad and retired from philosophy perhap not wanting to have the quality of his life dragged down by the logical realization he came to and the inconsistencies with which he saw within the real world he concluded that the senses must trick us classical physics computer programming and most mathematics will simply break down and become nonsense if we do not take the base assumption of it is     so congrats pick one that you think is true and live with it the thing that has been the most productive for improving our lives and relative knowledge however is taking it is but ignoring the heavy baggage that it comes with like aristottle did plato tried to reconsile these with his idea of the world of forms sounding a lot like the parmenidian solid and our own world like hericlituss never ending imperfect change
so theres no such thing as objective or subjective truth just truth
  so basically assume some arbitrary shit like 112 and go from there
  yes without one base assumption we cant have logic science math or any of that
nah fuck this shit im going back to zen
  please refrain from making posts like these until you get to postenlightenment scientific philosophy i recommend reading the essential peirce volume 1 and 2 for a real taste /his/ is impotent philosophy belongs on /lit/ and /sci/
  studying philosophy through history is like researching biological processes through fossils its important for studying evolution but makes absolutely no sense unless you have the living thing in front of you that and /his/s board culture is complete ass
everyone in this thread is about three centuries late to the party
  he fell for the kant meme
  implying it ends with kant
      honestly i miss when all the history threads were on /int/ it really went to shit when all the history discussion moved over to /his/ and it became a bunch of stupid generals
  kant isnt a meme
  implying it ever ends
objective truth here ama
  y r u gey
  this is why american education is so inadequate classically american education expected that the best of the best will have the best of the best parents to train them well such parents are dwindling and no one is there to carry the torch
  bump
  ur objectively a fag haha
no the universe is ruled by paradox
  no but objective reality does
  even if we could perceive it we wouldnt be able to talk about and even if we could talk about it it wouldnt be understood
  only in mathematics
      prove you are sane and reasoning coherently
  and how is this known
  you will see with time none of us are real there is nothing in this existence but you and the theatre of thoughts noone else is real
  take enough acid and youll find out
  yes op is a faggot
  this is what mathfags actually believe
  the definition of what 2 and 4 are as we defined them is what makes it true 2 by definition is half of 4 adding two halves by definition makes the whole so 224
  mathematicians by definition do not believe anything we deal in platonic truths there is no believe required
  does objective truth exist  op is always a fag
  there is no such thing as subjective truth
  but there is no such thing as objective truth its complete and utter illusion
  so you think mathematics is objectively true
  if anything be termed true mathematics would be the first thing
  prove that youre perceiving something and not internally making everything up
everything that is is the only thing that could be called truth human knowledge is just part of what is and none of the qualities we attach to it are real in any sense other than that they are also part of what is
  nice b8
  senses  the reason why maths is objective is because it gets rid of the sensorial part of verifying things you cant do that in physics for example the integral of x2 is still x3/3 ever since archimides calculated it via extrusion physics cant decide their minds on what theory to keep and which one to leave thats just retarded
  are you autistic nigga you dont use your senses in maths
  young paduwan do not misconstrue invariance as objectivity math is a human endeavour and though it may seem reliable now it will be nothing when the one not of this world the logos the christ returns to give you glory
  yes  pic related
  op is objectively a faggot so yes
  yes but its the domain of philosophy and religion not science
  nigger
  to me god is self evident  and thats what makes you a retard son
        there is only one two must arise from one because two is a concept of two ones two ones cannot exist together as both real for if there is one there cannot be two and if there are two there cannot be one    if one is real two are an illusion  if two is real one is an illusion but since two arises from one one must be the reality and two the illusion    there is only one    in creation the one appears to divide and there appear to be two witness and witnessed subject and object here and there and so on     out of apparent division into two there arises the possibility of the realization that there is only one the is one two is an illusion
  this
  leave
  im paid to be here
  there is only one nothing
how can you have two 2 nothings     objective truth
  maybe we arent sure we can try to figure out what is and isnt true and to reason things out as best we can but thats it theres always a chance we are wrong about everything    i think its noble to try though and i think its quite reasonable to assume that some things are true given enough evidence to back them up until we find evidence to the contrary      why does it have to make sense to be true
  the answer to that question is either yes or no therefore it is yes
  the answer to that question is either yes or no  proof
  we can try to figure out what is and isnt true and to reason things out as best we can      its always funny watching humanity trying to explain that which contains it
  there is no middle ground between existing and not existing theyre mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories
  proof
  we truly are the strangest liquid
  what makes yo say liquid
  not existing is just the negation of existing a and nota are mutually exclusive and exhaustive feel free to mention any examples of things that both exist and dont exist if you disagree
  it can be said that all squares are not circles and all circles are not squares  but to do this objectively you must do it in silence
  not existing is just the negation of existing a and nota are mutually exclusive and exhaustive  define existing and prove why this is true outside of the human way of thinking  feel free to mention any examples of things that both exist and dont exist if you disagree  perhaps the universe or certain things that exist
  nice
  feel free to mention any examples of things that both exist and dont exist if you disagree    existing implies non existence so existence itself is a perfect example
  prove why this is true outside of the human way of thinking  prove this in such a way so that i cant understand what youre telling me
  but this is where language fails and you are going to chuck a fit
  yes now youre getting it
  the interpreter is limited in that he must use words in an attempt to define and describe and the receiver then has to make an interpretation of that interpretation attempting to understand what the originator means    the speaker or writer must use words with care realizing that he cannot describe truth     words lead the mind into ignorance
cringe thread    philosophy is not science or even fucking real it exists solely for idiots to try to sound smart see            
  liquids shape themselves to their container as best they can as do we to a certain extent the more of us there are the more that we can find the edges of the container but also the fewer of us there are at the edges and the longer it takes to climb to the next level
  ehh its a good mental exercise so long as you dont take it too seriously    t someone who takes it too seriously
  are you thinking of gasses
  its not using words that makes things subjective its being unable to show that you are a reliable observer you cant trust yourself if you cant tell when youre dreaming you cant know whats actually happening in front of you
  if an omnipotent being existed he wouldnt be able to deceive you into believing axioms of math when in actuality all of them are false
  no gasses fill their container as it is the knowledge we have about our container is only stuff weve learned because there have been so many people to figure out where the edges are and because there have been so many people to support them by occupying that middle space and making sure that the body of fluid could actually reach the edges and continue rising in the first place    if we were a gas then we could just go reach out and touch whatever it was that we wanted to touch even if there were only a few of us but its not that simple in pretty much every way possible the reason that we are able to reach as high and as far as we can now is because we stand on the backs of proverbial giants giants that in this particular instance could be compared to the deepness of water in an impossibly deep well    were the water at the top anon and were trying to make our way up towards the light that we think we see at that place we think might be the surface so that we might overflow our bounds but the only way we can do that is if there is enough water beneath us to fill every nook and cranny of the rest of the well first    its dumb but it makes sense in a poetic sort of way
    how can you say that science owes its very existence to philosophy before the term scientist was even used what we now consider scientists were known as natural philosophers and in ancient greece mathematics music politics and the natural sciences all fell under the purview of philosophy    in fact the word philosophy literally means love of knowledge/wisdom
  yeah and christians started physics to understand gods world but we dont assume all scientists are christian nowadays thats all in the past because things have changed
  he is mistaking learnt knowledge for inherent knowledge it makes people think they have the universe pinned down     its just comes down to whats your distraction
  scientists have in the most literal sense come to a dead end when it comes to an explanation of what we call consciousness     even when they talk up ai they fail to realize that ai is still contained by the same thing which is not explainable
    this argument is literally akin to the confederates were democrats    who gives a fuck what philosophy meant 2500 years ago thats not what it means now      liquids shape themselves to their container as best they can  no gasses fill their container  umm ermm
  literally like a decade old field ye of little faith just let them work and see if they still hit a dead end in another 10 years
  scientists have in the most literal sense come to a dead end when it comes to an explanation of what we call consciousness  and so have philosophers      inherent knowledge  oxymoron
  who gives a fuck what philosophy meant 2500 years ago thats not what it means now       yes it iswhen the word consciousness is used it is not possible for one person to convey to another exactly what he inwardly experiences as consciousness each must realize for himself what such a word means in his own experience one cannot give another consciousness one person cannot tell another what consciousness is because of the limitations of the spoken and written word the impossibility arises from the fact that in order to describe an abstract experience abstract words have to be used     and how could it be possible to define the abstract words needed in order to define the abstract consciousness cannot be defined nor described because it does not have the properties and limitations of a sensorily perceived object     it is not possible to describe what consciousness is all confusion in philosophy and religion seems to be due to one adopting the interpretation of another or rejecting the interpretation of another forgetting  that experience of the indefinable and indescribable cannot be conveyed by the spoken and written word       the purpose of religion and philosophy is not to persuade or manipulate one to believe in anothers interpretation and assertion but to guide each one to observe and interpret his own experience to liberate him in fact from the interpretation of others their purpose is not to plan or instill beliefs but to liberate from false belief    the failure of religion and philosophy is that they become a substitute deflecting a man from his responsibility responsibility here meaning the ability to respond the ability to observe and answer to his own experience
  the ideal universe _is_ zfc platonism is what mathematicians use in their proofs regardless of if they think the power set of the reals is meaningful beyond being used in proof
        we owe our tradition of reason and the rules of logic to philosophy you may disagree with the arguments being made by philosophers today but just know that every time you use logic as a means of solving a problem you are philosophizing
this thread is just more evidence that nonpure math stex retards are low iq sniveling subhumans
  the ideal universe _is_ zfc    no
  
    we owe our tradition of reason and the scientific method to christianity you may disagree with the arguments being made by christians today but just know that every time you use science as a means of solving a problem you are worshiping gods world    this is what you sound like
  yes it is  no it isnt    but to guide each one to observe and interpret his own experience  and clearly interpretation is not reality im glad weve come to an agreement ok can we take this thread to /x/ now      
  this is what you sound like  its not what he sounds like whatsoever and you are clearly a low iq subhuman
  phil major cope is strong
  it literally is tho you seem to have not been paying attention     or youre braindead one of the two maybe both
    this is what disturbs me  the statement im quoting is completely preposterous and doesnt follow at all first of all philosophy has never depended on faith so comparing the two is strange but thats not what bothers me what bothers me is that a stemcel would even have a problem with philosophy at all     are you just not comfortable with reality as a whole and would prefer to bury yourself in abstractions of rule and measure to avoid the pain of being a human being if not for that i cannot fathom your hostility
  i study pure mathematics    its literally not you have no perspective or knowledge about what constitutes a valid thought from mere opinion  ironically you are the very type of person that needs the knowledge of epistemology that you are rejecting   but this is to be expected from an engineer subhuman
  calling me a fucking engie  how dare you you pathetic god loving shit stain  i hope you like rubbing your pathological need for closure by using a trash explanation like god to fill in all the holes  just accept that you dont know everything you 3 iq ritualistic chimp
    spoken like a true rationalist
  if youre not an engineer im sorry i should never had used such a grave insult
  its not
  you study tendies and world of warcraft       what disturbs me is someone waste their life worrying about the semantics describing the completely fucking obvious and the objectively fucking unknowable pragmatism is the only philosophy you need to know and its philosophy defeating itself enjoy being useless and accomplishing nothing
  no measurable cardinals  cringe
  you study tendies and world of warcraft  i dont play video games theyre a waste of time  your rejection of philosophy is very strong indicator of average iq at best if you really cant understand the place of epistemology then youre not to be taken seriously  what disturbs me is someone waste their life worrying about the semantics describing the completely fucking obvious and the objectively fucking unknowable  this is so sadly pathetic  pragmatism is the only philosophy you need to know and its philosophy defeating itself   youre an idiot
  what disturbs me is someone waste their life worrying about the semantics describing the completely fucking obvious and the objectively fucking unknowable pragmatism is the only philosophy you need to know and its philosophy defeating itself enjoy being useless and accomplishing nothing  massive cringe

  physics wbu sociology    youve already been exposed to the fact youre completely uneducated man give it up      4 posts 0 arguments wasnt really expecting more from philosophy major board tourists but oh well
  
  engineer larping as a physicist  sorry doesnt pass the smell test
    would you mind explaining how you feel christianity and philosophy are in any way correlated
  physics wbu sociology  pure mathematics i already told you that  youve already been exposed to the fact youre completely uneducated man give it up  this is why you need to study philosophy you dont even understand what constitutes evidence and youre supposedly a student of empiricism    it should be illegal for anyone to study stem without being forced to take at least 30 credits in philosophy classes stex brainlets are absolutely pathetic and give mathematicians a bad name from being roped in this them in the acronym
  thats gonna be a yikes from me my dude
  funny how youre too uneducated to realize that the left side of that picture is from the dawn of the quantum revolution when philosophers were perfectly able to reason through the physical world then quantum mechanics came into full force and rendered experiment vital to understanding the right side of that picture is the modern day  which do you live in      give up      im also pure math you fucking tist you dont need philosophy to learn math first order logic isnt philosophy last i checked      yikes
  first order logic isnt philosophy last i checked  holy fucking shit
  yknow what tell me what the fuck did you learn from philosophy that makes it so vital if you say how to think or some shit like that im going to fucking gouge your balls out
    you dont need philosophy to learn math    math is philosophy
  the only philosophy that is useful is determined by opinion ie morality and therefore not worth discussing on a science board besides that some metaphysical philosophy can help in terms of where we direct our research but thats about it and epistemology is fucking useless      so sociology got it      pure mathematics  lmao he said it again dude just admit youve never been to college    please enlighten me with some useful knowledge youve gained from your 30 credits of philosophy ill be waiting you crying little bitch
  what the fuck did you learn from philosophy that makes it so vital  i learned how to evaluate moral propositions objectively  i learned about the differences between multiple schools of epistemology  i learned the foundations of my field
  all thinking is philosophizing accepting that only opens your mind to consider things more deeply
    the only philosophy that is useful is determined by opinion    if philosophy is ever determined by opinion then it is not philosophy  it is conjecture
    get the fuck out    first order logic is a fucking tool how in the fuck can it be philosophy you dont even understand the field youre arguing for
this thread is cool and all but dont you guys think there might be a simpler answer to all this
  thats pretty much my point      i learned how to evaluate moral propositions objectively  impossible  i learned about the differences between multiple schools of epistemology  useless  i learned the foundations of my field  useless    good thing you took all that philosophy man definitely worth talking about
  you guys are straight retarded if you say that philosophy is the same as thinking then just use the fucking word thinking instead you wastes of space          i learned how to evaluate moral propositions objectively  i learned the foundations of my field  math is philosophy    philosophy relates to morality  philosophy is math  therefore math relates to morality  but math isnt moral and we reach a contradiction    i learned about the differences between multiple schools of epistemology  just think them up on your own lol
   shape themselves to their container as best they can   gasses fill their container  umm ermm  how am i wrong here serious question im restarted
    i would argue that philosophy is a tool and that you dont fully understand the field im arguing for otherwise you would have no objection to it     if philosophy has garnered a reputation for flakiness it is postmodernism that is responsible and not philosophy itself
  all philosophy is conjecture
    philosophy relates to morality    your premise is false already     philosophy relates to knowledge  math is knowledge  therefore math is philosophy    see how easy
  and science and math too
  your premise is false already  yeah i was repeating it back hopefully i illustrated that their view isnt internally consistent
    no because 1  1  2 is not conjecture its a priori reasoning
  a is part of b therefore b is a
  impossible  this is the ignorance im talking about it is not impossible whatsoever that you dont even understand this shows what ive been saying the whole time  you are not equipped to be taken seriously  i am filled with contempt
  so sociology got it  not smart enough to distinguish between different people  confirmed definitely not a physicist
  that wasnt my view at all and i made no claims that were in any way interpretable as such
  read the shit i greened nigger  im quoting these shits im not smart enough to make up stuff this stupid
  funny how youre too uneducated to realize that the left side of that picture is from the dawn of the quantum revolution when philosophers were perfectly able to reason through the physical world then quantum mechanics came into full force and rendered experiment vital to understanding the right side of that picture is the modern day  quantum mechanics means people can no longer reason about the physical world  werner heisenberg wasnt a quantum physicist  erin schrodinger wasnt a quantum physicist  niels bohr wasnt a quantum physicist  richard dawkins is a quantum physicist  bill nye is a quantum physicist  neil tyson is a quantum physicist  what the actual fuck you just went full retarrd
    whoever wrote the above post attempted to point out a contradiction in my earlier statement that math is philosophy by attempting to formulate a rational thought that wasnt mathematical and i think thats where he or she tripped up
  do you not see how those sentences could be interpreted as completely identical in meaning      i would argue that philosophy is a tool  how would you argue that any tool is intrinsically optional to use if philosophy dictates something it is absolute whether you agree or disagree it is ultimately either true or false
  useless  if you thinking learning things for their own sake is useless youve given yourself away as a nonscientist/nonmathematician kek youre probably a filthy engineer
  werner heisenberg wasnt a quantum physicist  erin schrodinger wasnt a quantum physicist  niels bohr wasnt a quantum physicist  the fuckers built quantum you inane shit  the copenhagen interpretation is an expression of the meaning of quantum mechanics that was largely devised in the years 1925 to 1927 by niels bohr and werner heisenberg it remains one of the most commonly taught interpretations of quantum mechanics
  you fuck i was quoting your dumbass
    the fuckers built quantum you inane shit  then wouldnt that make their commentary more relevant
  prove morality is objective im sure you will succeed where millenia of philosophers have failed
  i said the dawn of quantum mechanics  dawn noun   the first appearance of light in the sky before sunrise  i never said they werent quantum physicists    i said that philosophers were able to keep up with them on the left hand side up until quantum    quantum killed the philosopher but during the dawn they could keep up but not any further after that which is why a century later all the physicists have a bad taste of them
  yeah ive never been more confident of a b8 in my 8 years on 4chan nice try though
    if thats true then i think that supports my proposition that math and philosophy are essentially the same     in their purest forms now obviously youre going to have examples of bad philosophy that isnt rigorous enough to be considered true knowledge but thats not a reflection of philosophy its a reflection of the argument being presented     im not a math major but im sure youve read papers that are incomplete and poorly reasoned does that mean math is meaningless     i would argue philosophy is a tool because it helps to build rational thoughts and arguments
  quantum killed the philosopher but the very people responsible for quantum mechanics say the opposite youre making no fucking sense
  science has experiments and math has proofs so no
              
  they didnt realize that quantum would do it why would they the effects quantum had on the spread of scientific information discovery and the specificity of that information killed the philosopher if they had kept up with all of it then they werent a philosopher anymore they were too specialized in qm  bc the philosopher is a wouldbe physicist without a lab
  thats math not philosophy
  honey if anything qm brought philosophy back to the face of science
  i love how no one in here has even defined fucking defined philosophy
  but math as a whole is a tool whereas philosophy is a knowledge base much like science philosophy would have an easier time adopting physics than math imo either way its a semantic argument if math was philosophy wed call it philosophy which is why i hate philosophy it devolves into semantics almost infallibly    i would argue philosophy is a tool because it helps to build rational thoughts and arguments  the main help it provides with that is conjecturing rationality is usable in the first place and the minute it bears that conjecture that it can no longer be a simple tool
    philosophy relates to knowledge  math is knowledge  therefore math is philosophy    please destroy my premise i consider it axiomatic if you dont tell me why
  math is knowledge  math is not knowledge    destroyed
  they didnt realize that quantum would do it why would they  in what way has quantum mechanics fundamentally changed since bohr schrodinger and heisenberg  the effects quantum had on the spread of scientific information discovery and the specificity of that information killed the philosopher  i honestly have no idea what youre saying here can you elaborate
    not so fast now that youve made a proposition the onus is on you to defend it not to declare victory before youve even proven your point
                    
  wrong end
  knowledge  1 facts information and skills acquired by a person through experience or education  2 awareness or familiarity gained by experience of a fact or situation  theres a keyword somewhere in there  experience
  you mean philosophy relates to math but math is not everything it relates to
    knowledge is information  math is information   therefore math is knowledge
  large cardinals are fake and gay
    thank you let me amend my statement    philosophy is the study of knowledge  math is knowledge  therefore philosophy is the study of math
i like how the philosophiles kept spewing so much shit that the first out they got just keeps repeating get arguments for next time and define the shit your trying to defend its not respectable when you pit people who disagree with you up against a ghost
  the most hilariously obvious logic error ive seen in my life and it comes from someone talking about math and knowledge  water is a liquid  vinegar is a liquid  therefore vinegar is water  please be b8
    well vinegar is water its an aqueous solution but fundamentally its water a better argument would have been    water is a liquid  oil is a liquid  therefore oil is water
  based we only have a senses as a rough guide we will only get a snapshot of true reality
    of course youre not assessing the argument i presented it just mocking it by re framing it which isnt what i would prefer but i see what youre getting at maybe i can improve my definition
  philosophy is metastudy of knowledge this immediately presents a problem though since philosophy does not have the basis of what it studies and is therefore conjecture and not itself knowledge the basis of science is empirical reality the basis of mathematics is idealized truth philosophy essentially tries to be both describing reality like science and idealized truth like math but fails at both
  metastudy of knowledge  thats just epistemology bro
philosophy is the study of fundamental problems concerning reason  math is a fundamental problem concerning reason  therefore philosophy is the study of math    please destroy
    which is itself a form of philosophy
  yes but unfortunately studies of knowledge do not produce knowledge
  but not the whole thing
    a study of knowledge doesnt produce knowledge this is wrong by definition     are you guys starting to see why philosophy is important philosophy has this rep now of being a discipline for people who want to pontificate on the unknowable and untestable but at its roots its just way to know what you know     if modern philosophy is vague arcane and inscrutable thats because quantum is as well the two disciplines are inextricably linked
  not quite epistemology is the study of the theory of knowledge in other words what distinguishes knowledge from nonknowledge whereas the study of what we know about reality existence etc is more broadly philosophy
  this is wrong by definition   how so
  you get the point      i dont get why you think you can just make up definitions i mean math isnt philosophy so if your definition of philosophy includes math its wrong doing it the other way around is just trying to start a semantic argument for no reason oh wait thats what philosophy is
  all definitions are made up
    because the study of knowledge aims to produce knowledge for a study not to produce knowledge would require that it not be a study         im not making up definitions i quoted it directly from googles definition of philosophy if you are discontent with the statement philosophy is the study of fundamental problems concerning reason you should take it up with google not with me     personally i think the definition is apt
    you could say not all studies produce knowledge but you cant say studies dont produce knowledge because its not true in all cases
  its just way to know what you know   philosophy doesnt produce knowledge though and thats unnecessary anyway since the results of science and math are known and are knowledge    if modern philosophy is vague arcane and inscrutable thats because quantum is as well the two disciplines are inextricably linked  lol
  because the study of knowledge aims to produce knowledge  aiming does not mean you hit the target    for a study not to produce knowledge would require that it not be a study   then philosophy is not a study if you want to play semantic games
  i didnt say studies dont produce knowledge i said studies of knowledge philosophy do not produce knowledge math and science are studies but not philosophy
    youre confirming what i said earlier a true statement would be not all studies produce knowledge which is just another way of saying aiming doesnt mean you hit the target    but your original statement was studies of knowledge dont produce knowledge which is a bizarre statement but i addressed it anyway    i think youre the one playing semantic games
  justified true belief holder
    no thats not what you said what youre saying now is different from what you said earlier the proof is here         your parenthetical addition of philosophy is an entirely new proposition
any of you actually going to give a trusted shared variable that you all agree on so forward momentum can happen
    this is what is called in philosophy an ad hominem attack its a logical fallacy and not allowed in strictly rational debate
  what is this from
alright i think ive proven my point i hope that some of you lurking that are on the fence about philosophy have seen its utility i hope everyone here has a wonderful night
  youre confirming what i said earlier a true statement would be not all studies produce knowledge which is just another way of saying aiming doesnt mean you hit the target  then saying that the study of knowledge aims to produce knowledge is not a response to my request for you to explain how philosophy produces knowledge by definition    but your original statement was studies of knowledge dont produce knowledge which is a bizarre statement but i addressed it anyway  what i said in the post youre responding to is the original statement and you failed to address it      your parenthetical addition of philosophy is an entirely new proposition  its not an addition i defined philosophy as the study of knowledge and you even went along with that definition here 
  if science is testable predictions and verification philosophy is the language for communicating why that method is valid and to what measure we can hold validity its even the why of why is methodology important     science lives in the arena of philosophy its not something less important standing outside
  what does philosophy communicate and why is it valid
  saying philosophy communicates something is like saying religion answers why we exist do you see the problem
this thread is a beautiful showcase of how language holds us back from anything that even resembles truth
  i wonder what would happen if we created androids sectioned off some humans for testing made it so that they could only communicate images to one another with their android brains and just let their society develop would they develop a language analog or something entirely new
    the answer to both is it is the language for communicating importance or validity not that it has some final word its just the tools youre going to need to make an attempt    ultimately  is spoton but we wont even drum up an inkling without understanding what importance is what is this important relative to    and now were doing philosophy
  jordan peterson
  how is identifying jtb mechanics anything other than an observation
  then what language teaches you to trust in the information you recieve
     this is a debate not a math class youre out of your element
  what language  different anon but the one that constantly revisits and revises concepts like objective or subjective truth ie philosophy
  the answer to both is it is the language for communicating importance or validity not that it has some final word its just the tools youre going to need to make an attempt  which would be fine if it could potentially succeed at what it attempts but it cant if there is no method then there is no answer just people trying to shout their conjecture the loudest as pointless as religion best to avoid entirely
  how can i be out of an element that allowed anonymous selfinsertion without consent      philosophy is a language in the same sense all nondestructive categorization and division requires a language to describe the event
  best to avoid entirely  i will give you that defending philosophy is not the hill i choose to die on but mostly because it trivializes the most seemingly logical pursuits i look at it like a dont look down and you wont fall type thing    you keep scribbling your silly equations and ill keep doing whatever it is i do and as long as we never think about truth we should be aok
  philosophy is a language in the same sense all nondestructive categorization and division requires a language to describe the event  which is why i giveup and we all should there is no proper way to convey it close to doing the impossible is worth as much as never trying i like baseball
    you caught me in a trap what looked like math on the surface was some kind of advanced form of reasoning you would likely only to be exposed to in school     im not a college graduate or even a student im self taught so there are going to be ways to poke holes in my character by exposing my ignorance but that doesnt change the fact that the post i linked was ad hominem in nature and so is this even though its far more sophisticated    if you wrote justified true belief holder in response to someone defending the merits of philosophy and you yourself have studied it in university then you should know better
  not surprised in the least that a mathbot doesnt get basic philosophy
    close to doing the impossible is worth as much as never trying    kind of reminds me of plato talking about forms its true you can never reach it but in its pursuit you uncover greater understanding isnt that a better way to spend your time than just throwing up your hands and jerking yourself off
    you dont seem to either because youre not addressing or refuting his propositions
  its true you can never reach it but in its pursuit you uncover greater understanding  which brings me back to baseball in pursuit of baseball i receive a better understanding of baseball seems just as worthy    also is it bad that i take the platonic forms literally as in there is a perfect chair in a perfect realm     throwing up your hands and jerking yourself off  and how is that supposed to work fucking /sci/ thinks theyre so smart doesnt even know i need a free hand to jackoff in a meaningful way
    just as worthy as the pursuit of universal truth i mean maybe from a nihilistic perspective but i feel like the pursuit of greater understanding and knowledge contributes much more to the human race as a whole than baseball     i think plato may have been under the impression that there was a perfect chair but if that realm existed it was only in the mind i think that might have been the point but im not sure     what i meant to say was throwing your hands up in the air in nihilistic resignation to entropy and then jerking yourself off
  i dont have to because its been done much better than whatever i could write here
  just as worthy as the pursuit of universal truth  i mean maybe from a nihilistic perspective  close but im actually a pessimist i know i know that means i have drawn a definitive line of existence being a negative but you can do that without an objective truth     suffering is subjectively negative to a being with a nervous system its not pretty but its enough to go on    throwing your hands up in the air in nihilistic resignation to entropy and then jerking yourself off  or throwing them up in celebration after a fine kendall jenner wank
  yes
  i agree that it is better if we treated communication as strict preference profile swaps      my identity is derived from your evaluations and punctured by varying priorities i would never denigrade someone who willingly articulates their position and is eager to consistently translate their point of view so that other people may understand your universe better
    this is the vacuum that atheism has left and the space at least among the common people is being filled with virulent halfbaked ideologies that promise the world and deliver tyranny     this is my contention for philosophy that people should be taught how to think we cant know truth objectively but in the pursuit we improve conditions and minimize harm     there are actually people right now in droves who think that ben shapiro is a neonazi simply because he expresses views that contradict the opinions of their specific tribe even though its leftist and has a feminine face on it i dont find that any less threatening than a nazi     and this thread has further satisfied me that even getting stem majors to use their reasoning faculties in conversation and exclude their innate desire to chimp out and win a dominance contest by any costs is a laborious process the task of getting laquanjello beevis or tammy to behave and think rationally seems virtually insurmountable
  this is the vacuum that atheism has left  im not an atheist or materialist im a dualist     dualism doesnt rule out the suffering encountered by man ya cringey knob unless this is pasta in which case i like baseball
    i found a postmodernist i think so youre implying that every point of view is just as valid
    a dualist what do you think of eastern philosophy such as buddhism/taoism etc     i wasnt necessarily implying you were an atheist and you cant use cringey as an attack its overused im not going to fold to self recrimination just because you parroted the word of the hour     people always think the things i write are pasta because writing with proper grammar and punctuation marks constitutes unusual behavior in todays world implying i must have prefabricated my responses somehow theres just no possible way i could be coming up with original thoughts that include apostrophes all on my own
  correct a point of view or perspective is just something a concious mind holds they are all valid translations of their projection of reality because there is always a potential bridge to cross    valid just means translatable/relatable it is everyones conclusions that are always temporary/ethereal because a conclusion has to be subject to variable change    actionable intelligence is a different matter altogether all i know is that all have a perspective as i too must and they hold it as a true and accurate representation of their existence voice in their head/narrative everything else is translation or signalling of eagerness to communicate/continuing communication
    did you mean to say your universe or our
   which is and cannot be otherwise  so it is one of your fatnasy
  what do you think of eastern philosophy such as buddhism/taoism etc  the same as i think of using language to express an ultimate truth they have no cause to have anything of value spiritually but it might be fine for reducing suffering in the here and now     all that other shit  because the fedora  paragraph attack is a shapeshifter lad anyone can be excused to think its some native pasta with the important bits switched up
    they are all valid translations of their projection of reality because there is always a potential bridge to cross     how does that statement follow please elaborate further     and your particular version of the word valid doesnt match with googles definition arent you essentially defining yourself as the worlds author when you arbitrarily deconstruct and then reconstruct language     the consensus definition of valid is of an argument or point having a sound basis in logic or fact reasonable or cogent     youre suggesting that all points of view are translatable and relatable thats true but it doesnt mean its factual
    but even this is yet another language game so if were going to play games no matter what why not play one thats constructive rather than deconstructive unless of course you just want to see it all burn and thats a fair contention but at least come out with it and dont allude to it in ways that only a handful of people would understand and furthermore if that is your contention then just have out with it so it can be torn apart     of course the founders of this school of thought must have known that would be the inevitable result and furthermore that they would be subject to public ridicule so they snuck it in as a weapon for various other ideologies with antiwestern agendas     most nefarious
  i always defer and pefer our because it is a default state of inclusion otherwise you are always arguing about levels of trust when really you only care about duration because that level of consistency is enough to gift anothers key to their genius
  you too are the sole definer of validity for your experience set how much you believe a source reflects prior known values you believe pertinent is directly related to what language or grammar could be arbitrarily constructed    i just prefer to give examples as best i can but until asked i dont have access to that information    everything is you vs bridge of belief whatever narrative is being crafted in the readers eyes is ultimately their domain people remain subscribed for only as long as they believe benefits them eventually
    you too are the sole definer of validity for your experience set    agreed and tracking    how much you believe a source reflects prior known values you believe pertinent is directly related to what language or grammar could be arbitrarily constructed    this is new stuff i like it but i think nietzsche would be horrified to see his vision coming true this entropic deconstructive narrative should be fully embraced so it can be used as fertile substrate for something more solar and reconstructive in the future     that being said im going to contest it anyway because im not a fan of pain and i see this point of view ultimately leading only to suffering     if what you say is true then what i choose is imperative and i choose life and meaning  objective christian nuclear i choose to engage the world as an individual and not as a collective identity therefore individual contributions to a collective understanding but not a collective entity i think are most useful not attempting to use reason as a weapon against reason
  then my name is soil take root as you see fit and know that communication is also by some willing to simply teach bloom and flow as spiritual concepts    bloom and flow    all this i do simply to add to the collective understanding shared by another memory of brothers    or however you like to envision someone making an active attempt to seduce your universe
  this maths is to the sciences what logic is to philosophy    imo logic is basically philosophy making it the most pure intellectual discipline
  dude stfu lmao  based
were really starting to slice into some shit here that only very loosely belongs on /sci/ but i am of the personal opinion that the universe expanded in order to achieve multiplicity and complexity of form and to reunify as an individual collective in some malevolent ai singularity event and not a collective of individuals the distinction here being crucial in my mind would be regressive     not one tumor but a body you are not me and i am not you but that is beautiful because our difference in form and awareness allows the tapestry of life to unfold to cause it to suddenly become selfaware in the deepest strictest vedic sense would be a disaster for life
  we are containers of consciousness exchange all you can with all you meet
  by the definition of consciousness it must necessarily exist externally to you doesnt have to be physical
  is that objectively true or not
  112
  like anyone rightwing
  im sure you will succeed where millenia of philosophers have failed  both the categorical imperative and utilitarian ethics are objective
  prove morality is subjective im sure you will succeed where millenia of philosophers have failed
  i should rephrase it better  there is an objective reality but we have no way of knowing whether we are perceiving it or not because of the epistemological limits of our senses ie how can i trust my senses are providing me an accurate reflection of reality
  christ   lost you right there
we live only to enrich each other the only linear approach to life thats exponential
why hasnt graphene taken over the world yet
  meme material
  watch this video  
econ fag here graphene cant just be better than existing materials it has to be order magnitude better than existing material
  fell for the graphene meme  its a meme an overrated meme  its benefits were exaggerated by popsci fags
  its very difficult to make near perfect sheets of graphene really its difficult to make near perfect nanomaterials of any sort when you get down to it we suck at structuring material at the nanoscale
