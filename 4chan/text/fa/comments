share what youre wrapping your legs with  i feel like i missed out on good pants for too long    i got myself pic related today and i wish it was a little more tapered on the ankles but its alright i guess  what do yall wear mostly denim chinos suit pants cargos
unironically dockers are god tier pants in terms of rise and a straight fit
wearing levis 510 raws right now they fit good but the sort of boot cut cuffs are shit
  i wear sweat pants or track pants everyday  its comfycore meets giving up  and i will never change fuck your denim
  ok jim
dickies 874 or wrangler 13mwz
  used to wear chinos all the time eventually settled on black 512s literally the only pants i wear usually cuffed
  i bought two pairs of dickies 874s today too and idk if its because im used to slimmer pants but i feel they are comically wide i might taper them down a tiny bit
  same for me dude  im kinda skelly tho so slim fits often looks wide on me
  just received a skinny jean from hm on recommendation of /fa  this thing is crushing my legs
naked and famous super heavy weight denim because its winter and fucking freezing out there
either pic related or dickies 874s
i just wear cheap chinos right now but i might buy into the raw denim meme once i lose some more weight
16 euros kangol chinos
went to macys to buy some pijamas ended up buying this comfy af velvet pants
  and of course the pic doesnt upload
trues or 874s every day
show me your best belts
pic related only in black
whats the most /fa/ coffee mug    sick of carrying this thing around
mug or thermos
  paper mug from your local 7/11 equivalent
zojirushi
  correct answer
  kind of dope    wheres it from
got a naked steel hydro flask and scoured the branding off it looks decent
  i dont think theres any other vacuumsealed thermos out there where the cap is also vacuumsealed except the actual vacuum mug in pic related who cares about looking fashionable beverages staying steaming hot all day takes priority    zojirushi is great but theres typically intricate parts that are a bitch to clean through if you want to alternate between coffee and tea it will be a nightmare getting rid of any residue smells
  look good but too expensive
heres my trusty one used for 5 years looks perfect which is crazy since matt aluminum should scratch super easy i guess they used really high quality anodization    i was able to remove the brand since i dont need to show off some shitty brand in super reflective foil
  keepcup is the brand    theyre popular among hipsters joints where you can get like 50c off your latte by byo cup and feel good about the environment or something
  how did you remove the branding
bought two pairs of glasses that i thought would look good thinking id just return one  they both look awful on me  tried no shave november  patchy beard  buy some nice pants instead of just jeans  theyre too long and bunch up  who else /hopeless/ it feels like nothing works lads
4th facial paralysis  asymmetrical forever
  i feel you bro i also have some facial asymmetry in addition i have to readjust all my glasses to fit level on me otherwise they all tilt the exact same way i hope yours isnt too bad
i know i hate it when i spend money on something and it doesnt work out exactly as intended and isnt to my liking at least i can get on the internet and talk about it but honestly could it be any worse
  this was deep really made me think about my posts on a mongolian fast fashion sewing forum
   this is retarded return the glasses  get the pants hemmed or return those too
  dude african child soldiers
  shut the fuck up l i b t a r d
  if youre buying nice pants try and do it in person so you can actually see what they look like on you before you buy them
  starving african children can eat my ass
how do i have to dress to attract asians specifically
be blue eyed whte  dont be balding  have confidence
  does this apply if ur a grill trying to attract asian men too
  just be white and nerdy
all girls are attracted to the same things    1 men w/ big sexy upper body muscles  2 men who have a life/ their shit together/   jk all the asians will be on your dick if you cosplay as naruto youre welcome for this golden highvalue esoteric secret
  blue eyed white  literally the opposite of balding my hair grows at an astonishing rate  several people have told me i have a thousand yard stare that makes them uncomfortable  what good are blue eyes when they make people uncomfortable
  probably
  if youre good lookin then women will come to you its that simple
  how to dress to attract any woman
brandy
  depends what ethnicity are you
octopus shirt
  omggod holy hell hose digits
  holy shit its happening
  compelled by the power of the digits i will now become benfranklincore
  cute and boyish but not too gay
look like this doesnt matter what you wear in fact wearing nothing at all might be better
  how to achieve step 3
  literally this all i had to do to get my korean qt gf she raves about how much she loves it when i act cute and then loves how i am her man and fuck her like it
  asians are so fucking ugly holy shit  why do only beta males like asians
  were you abused or bullied as a kid
  dont worry anon asians cannot interpret emotional cues from westerners facial expressions so they wont notice you staring blankly like a serial killer
  bad case of upper eyelid exposure  its over for you
  doe eyes are cute
  i dont really know i have no memories from before i was about 9 or 10 years old    i was bullied yes but not any more so than anyone else sometimes i did the bullying no one person at my highschool was singled out like you see on tv shows or in movies it was pretty much a free for all my father taught me to box at a young age so generally i was left alone i was a loner though      shame that in my 25 years of life ive never even spoke to an asian lol
  i have a stronger jawline than most actors like i said my only problem is my stare
  either be rich or white
      its weird because my dating history is full of alternative models who generally suffer from borderline personality disorder yet they tell me my best feature are my eyes     but put me in a room full of normal girls and they tell me i look like a psychopath serial killer school shooter or that im simply dead inside    i just want a normal nonmentally ill gf who doesnt think i look like a killer
eat rice
  how many irl friends do you have and how often do you spend face time with them
  left is this a actor hes just pretending
  huh
  post face fuccboi ill tell u everything u need to fix
  digits confirm
  dont be balding  does it help if you are 62 tall but bald
  literally the opposite of balding my hair grows at an astonishing rate  bald people can grow hair at an ashtonishing rate too just not in the right area youre not out of the woods bucko
  has absolutely nothing to do with your upper eye lid exposure or the pic the guy posted to whom you replied
  being bald is objectively not as good as not being bald but having hair would not mean every girl would fuck you anyway  just live your life as you would if you had hair
  most girls dont care as long as you dont act insecure about it and hair what hair you have styled properly for the situation
i dated a korean girl wasnt worth it  would get mad at me for everything her parents were loaded but she used to steal a lot always lied to her parents what we were doing would act really nice to me one day then cold the next day sex was meh she was a legit fucking fish took baths every 23 days no tits/ass after sex would start talking about naming our kids and if should would make a good mom heavy drinker but didnt like weed after awhile to sustain the relationship i had to manipulate her but became too much of a chore
  for women attracting asian men  blonde hair blue eyes  sweet and innocent  not balding
  fila
be tall and not ugly
    me no study   me no no care  me go marry millionaire   if he die  me no cry  me go marry  another guy
  what if ur not white or asian
  literally every white woman with an asian man i have seen was a 6/10 blonde that looked like a nice girl and was skinnyfat to mildly overweight
   took baths every 23 days    was she one of those asians where they have no body odor i have an asian friend of mine and the guy just doesnt produce a scent now my white friends fucking reek after an 8 work shift
  nah they are incredibly rare and even if they exist theres something wrong with a woman who has a racial fetish for beta males
  because your eye shape is fucking disgusting
  if shes korean she wont smell  its kind of pointless for them to bath everyday or use deodorant
  tfw kazakh  tfw you end up as a glet  its not fair bros
asians are so fucking ugly and autistic you have to be genuinely mentally ill to be attracted to them
be white and not that fat would be my advice on how to dress
  its recessive so its very unlikely to get achad hapa though the mongol rape campaigns
  incel cope weebs and twinks are getting laid whats your excuse

  stop being jelly of those aesthetics
  1 he looks fine in the pic on the right and 2 youre projecting so hard holy shit imagine being this jealous and insecure
  thats a cute little tummy
         why is it that every time this guy is brought up theres always multiple consecutive responses defending him that are posted faster than every other thread on this board suddenly this thread went from being bumped once every few hours to 6 replies in the same hour really makes you think
  who cares the kid looks like shit either way
  certain waywt posters are egofags
  idk why everyone loses their minds with this white yoko ono
i actually like the fit but his stature is pretty irredeemable
  no

  flipping his images/taking mirror pics  do you think this somehow makes people look better
  this dude is a god
  he is cute cute

  mentally ill /fa/tist would still prefer some hipless sticc

    is this her did she lose weight and look worse
  assuming youre genuine here wear a line cuts high waist dont put huge belts on your waist or whatever would hide it no baggy tops
  fat pig
  if you wear yoga pants or tight jeans you will be perceived as a insta whore loose denim  good girl

  thicc
  50 posts later and op hasnt posted a pic    get da fuck outta here
  i get this reference am i cool now
  yes you are you fucking faggot
  this is going to sound edgy as fuck but i think i finally understand the male impulse to rape    i look at her and feel two things at once    1 utter disgust with her personality and full knowledge shes a horrible person who i would gladly throw in the gutter    2 sexual attraction    the only clear reaction to that combination of feelings is rape it satisfies both the lust and the rejection of her humanity
  but this is 4channel
    this woman votes
  please just post a pic  you dont even have to show your face
  what site is this
  no thats not her not the same face
  4channelorg

  not him but ive got a similar question ive known of her over the years only from pics posted on 4chan question is whats her story she has been blacked right
  not that bad tbqh
  definitely not that scabby underwear  fucking cant stand it going over the hips ffs
  she has been blacked right  why are the mentally ill so prelevant on channel 4
  tfw when widish hips shorter legs and big ass  well at least im on the taller side and my shoulders are rather broad i think the balkan genes made refrigerator body a forgone conclusion at least i carry weight pretty well but obviously its better overall when im /fit/    truth gf would let me know her friends would mire butt and legs when i wore my 513s
  this desu
nobody cares start a premium snap and get thirsty incels to toss dosh at you
  copypasta
  lmao second life tier body proportions
      am i thinspo yet

  be male  lanky  no ass    im serious i have it worse than hank hill
  squats
  does this work with bodyweight exercises thanks
  surely you must know this isnt 4chan
    i thought this would be fun to try out so i got my measuring tape out and fuck this is making me feel like a freak i cant even get my inseam measurement on there it only goes up to 104cm and mine is 110cm i knew i had long legs for being a big 65 guy but fucking hell are extremely long legs /fa/ for guys
  yeah help
  what the fuck lmao    just go to the gym and do squats with increasing weight over the weeks  also search youtube for some hints on getting a bigger ass there should be plenty
manlets btfo
  haha maybe i should have rephrased my question how can i look fashionable as slenderman
  underrated post
  this desu  she looks like a humanshaped balloon thats been overinflated i just cant go for this hyperthot look
  114 lb  not a chance
  yes it looks good long legs on men are also strangely attractive for women
  wow youre crazy pearshaped im 372742 yes i know i need to lose some weight working on it and what i find most flattering are crop tops highwaisted jeans flared leggings what i dont find flattering are short skirts but i wear them all the time anyway and shorts and most of all baggy shirts your legs are noticeably large so when you try to hide your small midsection under a baggy shirt you look much fatter than you are
  i hope youre right i havent noticed any women admiring my long legs apart from one drunk guy long story no pun intended but people can be attracted to anything i guess
  i havent noticed any women admiring my long legs  you need to learn that women are not men theyre not visual like men no women gawk at bulges like a guy would do with cleavage
            sabrina monique aka sadgalbri  i think this is her ig  
ah fuck i knew i shouldnt have started to skip leg day
  how do your pants stay up
  no women gawk at bulges like a guy would do with cleavage  lol he doesnt know
  i remember when i was naive like this too  one day he will realize that all women are cock hungry cum sluts far more obsessed with sex than any straight man
    youre missing my point women are cock hungry sluts we all know this but theyre not driven by physical traits the same way men are youll never hear a chick go she he was poor and had busted teeth but his shoulders were great so i went along with it unlike men who will routinely say she was annoying af but that ass tho women fuck the man/social status behind the dick not for the dick itself
  thats wise
  the prophet has returned
    moneycel cope
  youre fat dumbass probably an amerimutt only in burger land is looking like that considered slim
  thats legit supermodelthin except for the hips she would still be thin probably weighs less than 120 lbs
  right thats why all those hot college aged girls are fucking poor students who are attractive and popular    the absolute state of coping incels
  this entire site is made by autists for autists
  thats for social proof you tard
  fat
  women will choose money and status over physical attraction    okay friend keep grinding for that bread thats exactly what will get you the girls you want
are we gonna go to the whole 310 replies on this barely relevant horny thread
  god i was in that thread
  hurr durr i missed the entire point of that dudes post you literally said it yourself attractive and popular three things money personality looks you listed two ya fuckin autist
  have you never heard of girls marrying ugly old men just for their money its the oldest trope in the world
  please marry me
  if thay means i can look at that thicc godess every time the thread gets bumped i dont mind
    was it effay bros
  side view
    haha its funny because thats not how you would imagine a regular looking human body xd
  i thought it was pretty funny yeah
  cynical but also based
bump
im feeling pretty good about myself
  this is up there with fluid druid
if i was emperor my harem would be full of thicc girls like that fuck your effay bodies

  i can smell your fishy cunt from here jealous hiplet thinspo roasty
  ill have you know im a incel manlet with an above average dick who has wonderful hair and skin complexion broad shoulders a good physique and a large ass
  made a sketch of you based on your description
  spot on
  they marry the fogey for his money and then fuck the ripped pool boy tardosama
  thats still /usually/ a power play not just a sex thing a middle aged forgotten housewife fucking 22yo rico is mostly about the thrill of proving that youre still hot shit if you ask anyone of these women if theyd still do it if they didnt have an orgasm theyd all say yes a much lower percentage of men would say theyd still fuck a young girl if it meant that the sex would stop before the orgasm or at least it would take a moment of thought for men would i while a lot of women dont orgasm at all let alone with quickie in the pool shed sex
  your entire argument is based on conjecture
  she mentions that she only fucks black guys on twitter
i bought it for 60
why doesnt it say cum on it
very
op are you a boy or a dyke
dadcore  confident    i bet he gets more puss puss than any ninja here
you have to be an actual dad to pull off dadcore  just like you have to be actually sleazy to pull off sleazecore  really all the cores are faggot and retarded if you aint living it
bassist and dadpilled
rayciss and jewpilled
  he doesnt his wife doesnt want to fuck him and younger women dont want to fuck him
  there is no pulling off dadcore it just looks shit from any standpoint    the sole virtue of dadcore is that its worn by men who no longer have to care about looking good for strangers
  coiffurecore
decide to try to be fashionable since ive been wearing the same boring hanes tshirts for the last 6 years  start acquiring cheap but nice name brand clothes from second hand stores now i have alotta_clothesexe   go to a laundry mat because its cheaper than my apartment for this many clothes  some dude is loudly harassing people for money ignore him  dont know how long drier times go for ask a lady  she says she doesnt know then asks me if i have god in my life  after my clothes dry i then find a bloody tampon in the drier rewash the entire load and waste another hour    i never respected /fa/ as a board before today you guys go through a lot to be fashionable
sounds like youre just fucking poor lmao
  using the drier  are you retarded line dry nigger
  i am but i dont want to be boring
    dont worry m8 im also poor     we all make it spend your time getting good items through thrifting and little savings funds for the items you want
  so either improve yourself and realize you need to pay for dry cleaning  higher quality clothes it doesnt have to break the bank   or use your apartment laundry and not deal with the horrors of a laundromat   seriously if you want to improve yourself dress well present yourself in a regard be the man you wish to be you can find quality items on sale thrifted consignment etc    what this lad says
do they look cool after a while or do they look ugly worn    some anon posted this one        which is kinda cool
they are hot and sweaty in slightly less cool weather while also being cold and sweaty in cool weather
  good if you like having oily hands all day from touching your jacket just once
  ive got a barbour coming in the mail ill let you know my thoughts when i get it
whats wrong ladies aint you all supposed to give me sex by now
this is the old jose his beard looks much better now
  he will get sex hes good looking
  desu none of these look bad in the slightest
  middle one for wearing sneakers with a suit    i know its becoming acceptable but i still hate it
  slim fit
  the only thing i hate more than skinny fit suits are untucked shirts tuck in your fucking shirt zoomer youre not a brit with a school uniform it is no longer cool to untuck
  difference of taste i guess i quite like it and think its comfy looks better with summery type suits though
  pajeet is owed sex because he took a shower 
is red wine effay
yes but not german one
i guess though the obvious trapfall is coming off as larpy
  drinking german wine can never be effay
yes but stains your teeth
is this is a good one piece to wear
  no only if you are thicc japanese girl
  yes
    bud knows good  only asians
  yes i like the color and simplicity
alexandrasgirlytalk on youtube has a good vid on it
if is this exactly model than yes
  no    get an arena swimsuit cut out the lining put it on and cover yourself in clear slime then take pics and post here
how do i learn about fashion like instead of just remixing inspo i get from /fa/ and other ppl how do i understand why certain looks good on people and other stuff im learning color theory rn  anythin else  should i learn basic architecture also
  get /fit/ and forget /fa/ wear whatever is acceptable and trendy amongst normies  /fa/ is a fucking joke for spergs who try to overcompensate shitty personalities with fashionable clothing
color theory is good but at the end of the day your clothes have to reflect you if youre a boring piece of shit and youre only hobby is browsing /fa/ and grailed then youre gonna look stupid as fuck for wearing all these top brands with no personality attached youll look like shit and everybody will know why within five minutes of meeting you
  this
  please ignore this looking good and having fashionable taste are two different things people dont come on here for just opinions but to broaden their knowledge as unlikely as that may seem      ive found my taste to improve simply by experimenting a lot over the past couple of years i try to dip my toes into almost every aesthetic and managed to find my own that i am comfortable with it shit on me for reddit but look around on /r/malefashion and /r/streetwear because despite all the bullshit there is decent content on there obviously /fa/ is a place to go but there is a lot of garbage on here like there is on those subreddits    just experiment and try things as well as teach yourself to always be looking at it/out for it
  read the sticky
  same could be said about /fit/ its not that fashion atracts autists its that no one in their right mind would spend their time comunicating with random people over the internet using esotoric ms paint images  do whatever you want but most importantly learn to act less autistic
  i remembeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer how the darkness doubled  i recall lightning  struck itselffffff
  did you feel low
  technical questions like why are the biggest fucking rddit meme of all time if something looks good it looks good you arent a designer so just live your life   for yourself just look at a lot of content like past and present runway shows ad campaigns lookbooks etc and get an idea of what you like and experiment with that you will make mistakes and lose money thats how you learn    ignore retards like this 
bump
you have to give yourself a small foundation of knowledge by browsing the internet and lurking on forums that are better than /fa/ reddit and so on then think for yourself about fabric context outfits runway shows and such noone on this board likes fashion they like clothes
broadway looks so medieval
i fell  right into the aaarms  of venus de milo
hello folks i want to get a new pair of shoes i only have one pic related which are fine except that they are for trekking   i was thinking about a pair of vans red with brown sole but i dont like the idea of having shitty cloth shoes  consider im the average rk9 user but skinny  all sugestions are welcome
  jokes on you hiking shoes are the actually fashionable choice right now  buying vans is not only downgrade in style but in plain quality of the shoe
  thats what i thought when i used them vans have shitty quality and are uncomfortable  thanks for your post i guess ill buy the same pair of shoes maybe in other colour or other trekking one
  hiking shoes are the actually fashionable  do you mean hiking boots like timberland are in fashion or trail running shoes that look more like ops pic
  yoooo how comfy are these shoes i need a new pair of black shoes for work and i really like these
  timberlands are not hiking boots  trail running and actual hiking shoes are  rick is doing hiking shoe inspired designs  bbs is doing collab with salomon  kiko is doing collab with camper and asics  alyx is doing collab with roa  there are more examples but those are the interesting ones i can remember right now irrelevant garbage like marcelo burlon is doing timb rip offs and valentino has hiking shoe inspired footwear etc  its everywhere
  eh now that i checked the burlons are collabs which makes sense i guess
  they are really comfy a little bit stiffer than running shoes
i finally bought these ones they seem better made than vans  i still will use the trekking ones tho i was sick of having just one pair of shoes
  what are they
  dont get red shoes unless they are really cool and you are willing to tone down the rest of your outfit it sounds like you dont own much footwear so a versaitile color like grey might be ideal
  those areactually kinda cool good choice op
  dc shoes   well i guess ill have to tone down the rest of the outfit i still have the black trekking ones tho    thanks
how do i ask my barber for this cut
  ask for an undercut with 2 inches on top
  short back and sides
undercut made with a shitty trimmer and thinned hair on top    also ask him to ignore shaving behind the ears but that might not be necessary since shitty trimmers usually cant do that anyway
    i swear at times it looks like tom hardy is seriously balding but i think his hair is just super fine then he uses a ton of gel
  just do it yourself with a dull knife
  chad heaux haircut
what makes men in their late 20s30s think its still okay to dress up like teens why cant they accept they are adults
  parents of low social stature who never taught them how to dress  the npc version is athleisure  the soi version is workwear  both two sides of the same coin
  why make this same fucking thread with the same picture every week what are you some autistic menswear enthousiast
  shouldnt you go to some hiphop party for highschoolers baldie
  haha wow sure showed me so tell me what do you get out of making this same thread over and over
  this place is full of insecure boomers like igor that fit the description and losers that think streetwear/collecting sneakers is acceptable in your 20s i hope to upset them
  its impossible to dress good and not look off  only teenagers are tryhard faggots  men dress casually in their free time and in suits/work attire in their job time  wearing all black is not fashionable  wearing formal wear in your freetime is not fashionable  this is not victorian era  you are not fashionable because you are edgy you are just an edgy teenager
wtc middle right guys shirt or similar
yeah op i get you pic related a typical low class boomer looser still stuck in his teenage years bet this dude is a virgin too lol
  were in the 21st century adapt to modern times
dont see a problem with it think its pretty cool but each to their own faggot
all are professional skaters which is more than youll ever amount to     when youre older and wearing business casual onnthe regular to go to your office job youll realize it aint all that
  fashion is self expression fitting in the norm is not fashionable
  probably the most famous skater in history gets a pass
they dress how they act
at some point you need to stop going full skater that doesnt mean you can not still draw from it in your everyday life   dylan rieder was a decent example of a pro skater who didnt always dress like shit
skating lifestyle is pretty fun talking shit on everyone on fa lifestyle is sperg tier    maybe i should buy some vans
  i bet youre a lot of fun
  what is the most ideal non tryhard way of dressing as a 25 yr old
  theres nothing wrong with them expressing their normalness anon just because youre not normal doesnt mean other people shouldnt be dont get so hung up about what other people wear if you want to be outside of the norm do it with your chest out and dont look down upon those who dont have the same inclinations as you
  why
  whooosh
  its hard not to draw from itmost casual wear makes you look like a skater heath kirchart too
who cares    dressing your age is a social construct just dress whatever you like and stop being such a butthurt incel that cloth pieces draped on some other human triggers you
why do i have such a hard time respecting a grown man who spends the better part of a year dwelling on how other men dress
  holy fuck
  the combined power of yous and autism is unmatched
its not the former year reeeeeeeeeeeeee
  december is fucking shit i feel so left out when everyone of my age is out having fun with their cool friends im 25
im gonna be a sciencefiction hero just like uhura or captain janeway or xena

i unironically like sassy biker leather jackets like pic related problem is that im 195cm / 64 tall and fairly fit and all the biker jackets ive tried have always been way too short for my torso and trying to compensate with bigger sizes talking over xl doesnt work either since im not a fatass and the jackets gets too fucking loose on the waist    question is does anyone know of brands/models like pic related but with a longer cut for the torso
your retarded
  if you think wearing a jacket that ends at your belly button is fine im happy for you but since im not a girl or a fucking faggot id like to wear something more appropriate
      you may have to go bespoke if your proportions dont suit off the rack jackets     i would but i have more normal proportions and had to settle with a hell of a deal i got on ebay for a quality jacket because i aint got bespoke leather jacket kind of money
  yeah i thought about that but i also thought there must be something for tall people considering how big the market and trend for biker leather jacket is
    well off the rack stuff is designed with the median body in mind so it makes it hard im skinny and 510 and i have a hard enough time with some clothes so i cant imagine being 64 how large is your penis btw
  average i guess i dont believe that has anything to do with the leather jacket though
    no it doesnt i was just having an argument a few days ago with the wife about tall guys having horse cocks so i was curious thanks for indulging me anon
  that just means she knows someone taller with a larger cock or more than 1 guy sorry to be bearer of bad news
    haha its alright im sure theres many that are taller with a bigger cock and more money than myself were both experienced and i know her past exploits if she gets a pass so do i so its all good     but seriously we are reformed degenerates so we try to behave these days
greetings /fa/ggots as some of you know the cup is a virtual soccer tournament between various 4chan boards that takes place four times a year i am the clubs new manager and i wanted to get some feedback from the board so i know approximately how much time to tweak the club i have a poll included below that you can partake in for team feedback  tinyurl com/ydz67zn6  heres the team page      whats the state of the team as is  the last cup for /fa/ was the 2018 autumn cup and due to unfortunate results the club will be playing in the spring 2019 qualifications to make the tournament for that season my goal as manager right now is to try and get /fa/ to make the summer 2019 elite cup     also to note the poll i had linked has an outlet for anyone to contact me if they would like to participate and/or have a role in the club if you have any questions for me ill be fairly quick to answer them as i have a good chunk of time right now
  we need a from the back player
  this and a broken mirror
fourth for saint laurent paris meme as a player
  not sure why that hadnt occurred to me before but yeah a broken mirror would be a good addition the form i linked in the tinyurl would be a good place to suggest someone to put in and take out    i genuinely hope /fa/ doesnt want this but if they do i wont stop it
  fuck off shitposter you have already fucked this board up
  i hate it too but it is a thing innit
  just because its a thing doesnt necessarily mean it has to be in the team though why have a player on a team that the majority dislikes
  why have a player on a team that the majority dislikes  makes sense if you consider the fact how many times we tried get off this website
  maybe the player can start and we can cheer as he gets subbed off or cheer when he gets injured
  aight just scratch it i thought some anons liked the meme
  i mean some might sure there have to be since it keeps getting posted lets wait and see if it gets thrown in on the poll then ill consider it
  no  maybe make waywt a medal
  would do that if people dont want reviewbrah to be a medal anymore waywt is where a lot of the board resides anyway
  hey neat i actually had a roster in mind and asked a few times in the /vg/ thread about managing but i dont really have the time  ill post my   perfect roster     rick owens  meme shoe  buzzpill  effay  brisbane  raf simons  hitler youth  saint laurent  3sixteen iron heart  fuccboi  this party sucks  palewave  reviewbrah  yohji  dudes my hero  techno interests me  dark circles  thinspo  roof  w2c  waywt  sleazecore  from the back    definitely change the kits from the supreme shit id propose a home kit of the all black rick kitgolden letters and an away kit of the infamous pink raf dip dye black lettering goal keeper kits could be palewave or lunarcore sponsor on the front uniqlo maybe    the anthem should be switched back to peso and id say the victory anthem be she brings the rain by can that jacket was everywhere back in the day and itd be much better than the shit thats the current va
  neat fuji and i remember seeing you around and he thought i was you at first want to fill out the form would be helpful since there arent many responses at first also a link in there about possible roles you could have with the team
  also some of them ive considered putting in from the back palewave effay but im having trouble picking which to replace
    oh i see ive been a big fan of the cup since 2013 and been on /fa/ since 2012 but i definitely dont have the time to devote to it because of college classes  yeah sure thing ill fill it out real quick
  yeah i get that just want to make it know that not all of the roles require a large time requirement at all i make kits for /fa/ and /cfb/ in my free time when i want to relax and its quite nice if you get used to the process for kit creation you can bang them out pretty quickly
  i feel that i took down your email just in case i change my mind there but the form is all submitted
  censors the mouth  kek  thanks though im hoping the team can be truly competitive again like 13 and 14
  no problem me too /fa/ has a unique culture compared to the rest of 4chan but the team has been pretty mediocre or bad for the time ive followed it ive had to bandwagon the other boards i browseor used to in the case of /mu/
  fucking hell are you me you sure sound like it ive stopped browsing /mu/ and exclusively stick to rym at this point or i just go to /mu/ and ctrl  f /daily/ or /rym/ or chart stuff that board has had the highest fall from grace
  i like it
  i do like it tooi think some of the ones he suggested get removed from the roster are the ones id take out too
  what the current roster  too lazy to look it up myself
  circled are the ones id take out first personally
  things i would scratch  shia labeouf  young stalin  what you circled  talk shit post fit  maybe lunarcore but im not certain on that
  tspf was the next thing i was going to circle definitely another weak one thats not really relevant anymore shia and young are going to be hard sells to drop theyve been relevant on the team and id like to see other players get dropped before them lunarcore is going to stay for now its pretty relevant imo and i have a good tactical role for them already
  understandable all i can give you is a perspective from nu /fa/ 
  yeah /mu/ really rook a nosedive a lot of the good posters left and everyone has been replaced 5 times since i last spent any significant time there in 2015 seems like everyone is obviously a 14 year old  and not even the pretentious avant teens like that used to post there   i spend most of my time at this point on /fa/ /a/ and /v/reluctantly
  well its a good thing the team is in current year and you browse the board in current year your input is valuable no matter what if youre a regular aside from exclusive slp posters    those pretentious avant teens were so much more tolerable than the current memerap teens that have killed it now theres still threads posted about the /mu/core or once/twice removed albums but everyone knows there wont be any true discussion about it its all on rym anyway  my boards are /fa/ /out/ /sci/ /g/ /ck/ and then /sp/ for quick glances when man united loses and /cfb/
  i would add deep web core
  you think it has been prevalent enough for a while to have it included
  well hedi used to be in the team  probably upgrade his name to hedi célimane
  i personally believe so
  id consider it then ive got a notepad with possible additions and ill add it
from the back and palewave in no poo and talk shit post fit out
imagine unironically not wanting the slp meme player to be included and have extreme leg torso ratio in game
  why
  no thanks
  i dont know about that its kind of a new thing it may not stick with the board culture like other trendspalewave lunar sleaze
  was thinking this as well maybe in a future cycle if it sticks which i think it could but theres probably more deserving player ids at the moment
  dont think hedi will be coming back hes not on the squad anymore for a reason but i cant be arsed to remember that reason
  will you be posting the results of the poll when its finished
so im going to philly this christmas and i decided to run like rocky cause why the fuck not theres just one problem the clothes i cant get it exactly like the original rocky wears this blue towel or something around his neck and i dont know where to find it or what it exactly is please help me
bump
wear a noose around your neck instead of towel are you seriously going to attempt to recreate a scene from this shitty movie
  is anyone going to help me out or no
bump
cause why the fuck not  there are literally so many reasons people from philadelphia are so tired of that shit i swear the running up and down the stairs dressed as rocky is the dumbest fucking shit  is anyone going to help me out or no  help yourself out and retire this stupid fucking idea
    stop bumping this shit this post isnt even an hour old fucking faggot
  nice fucking troll nigger
bump
  bump
  watch the movie and check for clues senpai
  heres your you you sad little pathetic soi boi
its called wearing two hoodies at once because he cannot afford all that fancy and warm sportwears so just run with what he have    so basically the opposite of you
i want a classic style coat like this  on a tight budget yet decent quality what can you recommend
w2c fisherman sweater 100 wool under 50
save 3000 and come again
  only heavy thick wool
  best inspo porn is degenerate tho
    shit this is great dont think ill ever drop near 10k on a piece of clothing that isnt 11 tho even if someday im able to 3k tops is aight after that only 50k max on a watch
just be patient and look around for a good used one maybe its just because these coats are associated with moroccans in my country who arent exactly popular to put it mildly but they are sold regularly for only a tiny fraction of their original value for a few hundred you can find a pretty nice one
    ebay and thrift stores
  they start stink after a few months
  id on boots
  wash them you moron
  washing leather shearling    who moron
if youre a poorfag just wear sherpa youre probably young and would feel self conscious anyway which means you wouldnt pull it off
how can we make coveralls work
  good proportions and confidence
w2c shoes
  you dont wearing coveralls in any public setting makes you look like a massive faggot who really wishes they could skate but cant and just watches their friends
  yeah but get something quality      still hard to pull off imo
yellow vests  red maga caps  pink knitted pussyhats    revolution aesthetics are out the window   itt suggest one 1 clothing item which would be a more _fashionable_ political statement
 hoodie   sagging jeans   nike jordans    i call it the buckrising
  anything that leftists wear leftists are infinitely more fashionable than rightwingers just by virtue of forcing an all black dress code for black blocs alone
  unironically this pleb rightwingers btfo
    im right wing and the best dressed on this board
  you know who else wears all black
  pics or gtfo /pol/nigger
  i hate to admit it but its true  that doesnt mean leftists are fashionable tho
  all black isnt fashionable its an outdated cringy copout for plseudoedgy teenagers
yellow vests not effay  its just the next step of the mens work wear evolution its bold while not being childish by sticking to the roots of the hardworking commoner
  by my calculations its the man that makes the clothes not the other way around    yellow vests are probably the most /fa/ theyre common people who arent playing dress up like antifa they only wear the vests so they can be identified by their allies other than that they just wear whatever blue collar clothes they would wear any other day    the maga hatters are next for similar reasons but since there havent really been happenings on the scale of the french riots they dont have the cred of the yellow vests yet    antifa and other leftists are pathetic they care more about their aesthetic than doing anything useful and still manage too look like high schoolers vandalizing cars they get their shit pushed in every single time they meet any kind of resistance
  you wont post a fit pussy
  yikes
i read somewhere that french motorists are required by law to have one those yellow vests in their vehicle its a good choice for a movement because anyone can easily join in as they already have the uniform its also metaphorically a good outfit because it represents the common man as its such a widespread clothing item in france
hahhahahahaha so happy im not into current fashion
  imagine growing up as a zoomer and the first popular shoe you notice is some adidas nmd abomination or god forbid those h u m a n r a c e pharrell sneakers
  post some better first popular shoes
  dior navigate boots are the most fashion victim boots out there
  nothing makes me want to wither up and die inside more when one of my buddies asks me if i copped the new yeezys or asks my opinion on some hurace sneakers because im into clothes and stuff
  why are you acting like youre better than them your taste is not objectively better or worse than theirs maybe you should be happy that you have friends who are willing to attempt to talk to you about your interests
/fa/ oldfag thread    tell us when you first started browsing here and post old /fa/ memes trends trips and pics etc
one time slater stood on his chair and took his dick out in effay tinychat and his grandma walked in while he was doing it lol
when skater was here  denim dan was here  trunks was here
where is he now boys

  i remember when this place was like classic mfa all about menswear and then 2 years later suddenly turned into the goth ninja corner
  he died from ass cancer no i distinctly remember him having some sort of cancer
i was here when knoch was posting and there was a hubbub over the guy with milk and cereal in his hands in an alleyway also sieg
    destroyed sufu and never to be seen again    reality tho  prob got kicked out
  last i saw of him was on some fashion website where an article showcased new stone island pieces and trunks modeled for the pics featured on the article
  sieg is eternal the fat gook is still here somewhere
  just saw him like half an hour ago
reminder that trunks has a retarded brother
  that was haven which is a store in canada  and that was one time rather haven cycling him with the other models for their editorial entries
  whoops guess my memory is shit but youre right
  how trunks was approached ill never know     whos dick do i have to suck to make it on highsnobiety
listen here you thirsty little fookboi  
where is jalland    where is franz kafka    where is unpop    where is jackal
  classic case of boomers v zoomers
  tfw no qt asian bf
  
i started lurking /fa/ at the height of casemods shitposting spree that was also when the infamous denim dan pic got posted all around the board if i remember correctly that was 2011/2012
  same brother  those were some good times sips
who still has the yesstyle macros    hahaha he streamed getting his dick sucked by a dude      trunks was the biggest fucking faggot lmao  the fucking blue dbss sneakers damir doma diaper dyed that jacket pink ugly gook girlfriend what a fucking tosser    hard left turn from menswear into goofnigger from clarks desert boots and raw denim to sruli recht dildo and geobaskets good times    casemods asking for advice hitting on the dollar tree cashier ive got the fucker added on steam
what was the name of that longwinded trap who eventually fled to tumblr they had admin friends and would always tattle to them to censor threads
  ive got the fucker added on steam  what does he play
  obligatory
  is casey ever coming back to reclaim your throne
  sieg  that fat fuck is still here hahahah
what happen to scarface ever since he got bullied on /fit/ i never saw him post here again it saddens me because he was the only nigga i could relate to
  damn instant sadness remembering that dude  such a little ball of depression and insecurity
  this is the chick he fucked btw in case anyone is questioning his story
  he was like the /fa/ version of elliot rodger god i miss him remember that time/fa/ trolled him into buying a rolex watch cause we told him it would get him laid haha
  i hardly remember anything specific about him just the acne and pictures and general sadness cant fucking believe the timestamps in that pic are 2011 kill me
  what happened to the model that used to lurk here some years ago not the two skinny ones    the one that looked a bit like superman and was kinda built
  everyone was a boomer then zoomers were 12 at that time
  jalland  killed himself  franz  lamest attention whore in fa history  unpop  in prison  jackal  probably doing premium snaps    i miss tomorrow
  i remember when there was a hubbub over knochs hands milking
started lurking fall of 2012 so pretty much 50 of the threads were casemods shit posting and the rest were a strange transition to goth goof ninja from a bunch of menswear shit i remember manlets coping by posting pics of nick wooster and at the time i thought he was very fashionable lol
anyone remember that old femanon trip that killed herself    
  story
  i dont remember the whole thing but she used to be a trip here and a couple anons got a hold of her facebook then find out a few years later she died from a heroin overdose and posted about it here and also found her nudes floating around
where can i find this shirt /fa/
  rip blah i nutted to these pics often      tripfag prost who killed herself by oding
  post her fb
i started browsing when 2008era menswear stuff was what the board wanted think ocbds clarks chinos  what is now called mfa    a bit before i was in college 2012ish the board changed to streetwear rapperinfluenced fashion rick owens of course people still liked the old style better so there was a decent variety and exchange fun times
  near the end of alicias life she became a literal cokehead prostitute  theres a pic of her somewhere with a black eye one of the johns gave her lol
  i stopped here for a moment years ago and there were lolita threads but i was too fat to cop the style back then also not japanese
  jelly is happily married im glad because he was always such a kind boi
      jesus christ
i have a chart somewhere circa 2012 of all the tripfags and like what they contributed to the board ill try to dig it up
  here we go  i wasnt around for it but i think i have the 2007 /fa/ meetup pic somewhere
  2007 meetup
  good ol casey  i have him on one of my steam accounts and i played csgo with him like 2 years ago i think that was the last time i talked to him
  i think about this picture a lot
  casey should be in the upper right corner
  what a terrible chart
  false
  oh god whyd they use literally one of my worst photos for this
  i have much worse of you somewhere
thoughts
   
  can we see it from the back
who has the tinychat screenshot of slater sucking off his roommate
  from the back
  glorious
  jesus i had forgotten about this
not posting the full image is kinda of a newfag move
who was the trip that wore those weird nazi boots and suspenders his name started with an o
  oioi    his name was ivan and he was actually 16 legitimate asberger diagnosed he used to piss into latex gloves and keep them around as toys     
  i miss board tans
  yikes
  oioi thats it thank you lol was he around in like 2014
  have all the styles in this image completely died on this board
  just go to the thread and youll know when he was where    the snapple bottles with piss collection and his toys really paint a picture
i remember when /fa/ was actually a legit place to come for fashion discussion and advice with people who are knowledgeable and skilled in the field    wait no i dont because its never been that and never will be
  probably i dont spend much time in waywt threads but these show up occasionally in inspo threads
  its been at times when people like patrick bateman knochensack anorak and the like posted
  im sure this gets said a lot but thats eric clanton
  i can only recognize unpop and chauncey
    omfg that is worse
i remember that lad who put carried a stick of celery in his pocket bloody strange one
  but do you have this image  properties made 2013  probably when i reinstalled windows even older originally
  obviously shopped
  has /fa/always been so moody
  same
  i think the guy would wear dior/saint laurent paris so no
does anyone have this fuccboi general pic of hank hill
  anyone have that pic of trunks holding cereal
  here you go daddy dubs
  thanks still makes me laugh
  i still like palewave
not /fa/ specifically but the era
    too effay/too basic in an autistic way  meme shoes to the average person you look like youre insecure about your height  if you like that style then thats cool but id spice it up by adding bracelets or a watch or something maybe some rings    i think do something different with your hair cant really tell because of the censor    accessories and piercings will make a basic look look less basic and more aestheticy
  legs nailed to spatulas that are taped to spoons  maximum kek
  mamma dod  that guy had some good fucking fits
  please do me a favor and downvote this stupid fuck  
  nice thumbnail douche bag
  how do i get a bf like /fa/kun
  gtfo fag
anyone remember the guy that was pretending to be ciara i think it might have actually been denim dan also does anyone remember chuck the cuck who pretended to be a tripuser named ree that was a girl
  whats his name i remember seeing him in a movie he worked for a church or something
the great miranda/eyebagskun saga
cole mohr
the shemagh was a big thing
whatever happened to psuedo last i saw him was early 2018 posting shit that made me question his sanity
first came during that changeover to goth ninja another already mentioned so i missed the era that i actually dress in didnt come out of it unscathed as to this fucking day i get the inexplicable craving for a pair of fucking geos white/black or milk/black     fuck rick   fuck you all
  that vid is a classic
  i guess hes done with /fa/ again at least for a while still posts a bit of music and visual arts inspo on his ig
  hes back on drugs after another girl cucked him after the wife beating and assault thing i think he should already have left the internet for good
  oh man does cooltop still post  anyone have the pic associated with  does this blazer fit right
how to look like him /fa
  cocaine is a hell of a drug
  be ugly and creepy
could i get a rating from somebody who doesnt wear skinny jeans pls posted before and got bullied cuz ppl are just trend chasers thanks
  normie at best also button your shirt the right way retard
love the jacket  i dont think the blue and stripes of the shirt match the outfit though  pants are nice and look like a good fit  shoes are my least favorite part    6/10 right now but this has the potential to be closer to an 8/10
    put your pants in perfect fold and iron cycle next time you wash them       any bright coloured cp is chinese millennial tier
  has it ever occurred to you people wear skinny/slim stuff because it genuinely looks better    the pants are too big they make your hips look wide and the bottom makes your feet look tiny and out of proportion
  back to thinspo retard
  has it ever occurred to you people wear skinny/slim stuff because it genuinely looks better  purely subjective  the pants are too big they make your hips look wide and the bottom makes your feet look tiny and out of proportion  op looks tall and his waist looks like a 34 at the widest youre out of your mind
  who the fuck buttons like that
  pic related is ideal fit in the thigh anything looser makes it look like you have birthing hips
  does my face make it a 10/10 i feel like i have the rugged features to pull it off
  absolutely awful
  button up the bottom two buttons instead of just the top or just the second last button
  11/10
  his waist looks like a 34 at the widest youre out of your mind  cool too bad hes wearing massively loose pants that makes it look even bigger than it is
  has it ever occurred to you people wear skinny/slim stuff because it genuinely looks better  people wear skinny/slim stuff because its the current trend but its already dying as loose fits are making a comeback
  those eyes  anon they pierce
  the taper on the pants just isnt flattering its too slim at the knees so it makes his hips look bigger by contrast  the whole fit is mfa tier
  skinny jean wearer here it looks fine but the pants could use some hemming by a tiny bit or cuffing and they do look a bit wrinkly otherwise this is a slightly basic but still pretty nice fit just make a few adjustments and i think this will be even better
  op here i only wear baggy pants because they look good not because they are a trend meanwhile sheep are still wearing skinny jean leggings
blue and green is usually to be avoided    otherwise solid fit
id on jacket
  everything is good except for the shoes get them in the bin
  where to cop the jacket
  fuck off thats just your opinion i like them and they look good with my fit get out of here with this rude shit
  thats not you you just took that picture from /r/mfa why do you do this
  can i not post on 2 different fashion related websites first you insult my clothes and now youre saying im someone else shit people here really are delusional
  could i get a rating  yeah sure if you could handle a rating instead of living in your delusional safespace  why do you even ask for advice if youre some knowitall fashionista god  kys thanks
  pants fit pretty nice blue cps dont really match the pants or anything imo top half is cool givin me slight cholo vibes but do your thing man i like the corduroy tho
  unbutton top 2 if you must button the bottom 3    take you hand out of pocket and buy straight 1 waistsize down pants then maybe hemmed 1 inch hard to tell how long straight cut will be since these are tapered    currently a 38 with those changes it could be a 7 anymore changes and it would a totally different outfit    also slim fitting isnt a trend anyone who says its only recently popular wasnt alive during the 80s id said its more of a trend that people buy illfitting clothes like these
    stop replying to this awful bait its confirmed op is larping    any delusion is you projecting the delusion that is your life why do you spend your spare time saving pictures of strangers and pretending to be them what do you get out of it

fshitter really does make some nice watches
thank you kol
  really youre not just shilling now you have to circlejerk as well

thoughts on the seagull 1963 i like the look of the dial but it seems to be a bit chunky when ive seen wrist shots of it
  doesnt even through a nato strap on the g shock    wasnt even into watrches when i was in the military and that was a must if you wanted it to be secure
tfw endgame
  i dont like it
having a drink or 6  posting watches  enjoy your day /wt/
  i cant wait for you to post that you cant believe the weekend is over u repeating bitch
  it looks too much like a fashion watch to me
  hating on hammybro  kill yourself
  why so much casio a lot of what you have there is basically the same you need to switch it up with something that stands out
  have you thought about getting the original gshock square   it would suit your collection and taste imo
  i cant beleive its still on
  not in military or any rugged situation i wear gshock to feel like a big man doing big things they wrap around my wrist like a blanket and tell me i matter next up is a glacial gold and a dw5900 then one day this fucker
  i really need to f5 before replying yeah i need a square thing is though i am only trying to get 1 of each gshock model so buying a square isnt an easy decision if the radio tower doesnt go down in 2019 for america then ill probably get this carbon fiber with titanium back if not then i will probably get a newer one with a combi bracelet
  aye thats a pretty good choice
  my original plan was to get that and an oceanus both weightless on the wrist pic related and a glacial gold will buy both at the same time are up next the dw5900 might as well be a square form factor wise
    speaking of squares rip
  who
roll digits for whether tax season will be juicy enough for me to buy an omega aqua terra
  no
  credit card it is
  looks like a presage
  im crazy about the 8500 caliber wondering how much of its changes like the coaxial are just memes but i really think itll stand the test of time

  bro they are trashtalking your collection on the discord
  the newer ones have backup bluetooth for time vibrating alarm lost phone function and more
nycddancer  people in the discord got very interested in vagers   we would love to drop some infohow do you like in it how it wears like whats the quality like and maybe a few pictures   thanks mate
  picture to grab attention
  this isnt new retard casio hasnt had mail or calls on the squares since like 2013
  its just the one dude didnt get any replies the first time so he posted it again i am /wt/  the quality of my pieces speak for themselves       i really wish they didnt put bluetooth on the actual watch idk it just bugs me
  it just bugs me  75 of the shit printed on digital watches is stupid marketing stuff so i dont see why it bothers you
its a stupid discord nigger makes a new thread early so they can advertise their gay clubhouse episode
  discord zoomers are the fucking worst
    these  pretty much on the same level as tudor or the other faggots
      im guessing posting a discord at least for these threads isnt something that can be banned i forget where you go to ask mods about that stuff but it seems like they should be able to we arent playing a game together or anything its just people posting there instead there is no benefit and only 10 people maybe actually talk on it
  god i fucking hate discord fags
  why does anyone even care its just a line of text in the op
  yeah maybe i was too harsh but he should at least have some fucking decency and wait till the old thread is at bump limit  this just messes things up
          did you actually threadsplit 100 posts early actual trash
early thread  let me just remind you all that if some ops wasnt excluding the discord linkproper one not one with missing letter the discord fags wouldnt be so active about making new threads and advertising their cord   same level as tudor  our combined efforts was the reason tudor stopped bothering us and you   its just people posting there instead  only 10 people  there are more people active there than here   more content you can have private conversations no captchas some people are onlydiscord at this point other topics too if you are into that     its your choice to join or not we just want everyone to know that there is this option too    with deepest sympathy   discord admin
  if they dont want to post in the thread they shouldnt come here might as well be a subreddit or some shit hey guys post here instead      fuck that these threads are slow enough the same 5 people can circle jerk here instead
  fair enough
  implying the level of watch discussion is higher on the discord  enjoy the same five people endlessly memeing the same worthless watches and spamming no wimminz aloud     private conversations other topics  if i wanted reddit id use reddit     dont threadsplit just because the op didnt post a link to your super sekrit club
the perfect watch is a circle with twelve numbers fwo hands one dial and nothing else is neccesary desu
  dont threadsplit just because the op didnt post a link  ill decide that
  or you can not come here at all that would be cool what you are describing doesnt sound like 4channel if you dont like the format of here then maybe stay off you could try reddit or watchuseek of something too i believe they also dont have captchas private messaging etc
  except it doesnt and it isnt a cheap seiko
from discord    only reason i want the link the op is that newcomers could find this place more peoplebetter discord    yeah fuck off man how about a better 4chan thread ya secret club faggot
a better 4chan thread  sure make one
  what he doesnt realize that the more people he gets there the more it becomes like a 9gag comment section it already is full of memes and shit  i still use both on occasion but very little actual discussion is happening there or in this thread  at least i can thank him for driving away the fucking tudorcuck he was the fucking worst thing these threads have seen
you guys are like women no wonder youre always shit talking people with money who can afford certain watches  let the discord fag post his shit i tried discord once and didnt like it but youre just bringing more attention to it with all your whining    also the discord op is no worse than the faggot who couldnt use the thread with the guy asking about jlc because he needed to make a thread with his horseshit greentext and the faggot with gay casios needed to post first  kys
  we are on /fa/ now hmmmmm how can we make this even worse i know a discord i love having a username messaging and heavy moderation lets try to get more people from the thread
  go back to discord or any other platform if you dont like it here just dont link it here
  yes but over there you can at least be sure 75 of the questions and opinions posted arent bait from shitoposters at this point there only 2 or 3 posters to these threads id ever bother typing out a seriously reply to because i recognize them and now they arent just baiting people
  you guys are like women no wonder youre always shit talking people with money who can afford certain watches  pottery    ps filtered do not bother responding
  theyll do as they please faggot you dont the thread of dictate how it goes if anyone had that power theyd nuke you russian shitter faggots
  if anything you people are exactly like that fag  go post a pic of your plastic casio on a nato strap queer
  go back to discord      dont come here then stay on whatever other platform you like
  why would i go back to a place where i never was  go back to the time teller and tgvs comment section
  ive been on these threads for several years and im not going anywhere i just finally learned to stop trying to spoonfeed horology to shitheads
  who are you  t not anyone of these retards throwing poo around
good morning wt     the 19gs was the first only traditional mechanical watch in a ladies size
  first 36k vph
      nice 19gs hows it run im sure whichever watchmaker you one day have to bring it to will love working on a hibeat that small
  very little actual discussion is happening there or in this thread  i have seen multiple people say this why not add to the discussion in either place instead of bitching about it last time i saw someone bitching in this thread about discord was talking about how people didnt know about some technical topic instead of correcting them or explaining it here they bitched about how stupid other people were the thread is made up of only us there is not horological jesus that will come down and start posting good watch related content be the changeetc
of course the watch thread has the greatest concentrations of autists on /fa/ engaging in a 100 post long meta discussion about the quality of said autistic conglomerations
  runs excellent actually i regulated it to 5/8 spd in six positions iirc yeah trying to figure out where to get it serviced especially since like the 45 theres no cheap donors
  yeah we should send these fags back to /g/ like seriously thatd be crazy if we did that somehow like what if we really got that to happen oh man we should do that
  okay this is epic
this watch yes or no
  yes  any nudes
  nah its kind of thick and big for a dress watch hardlex instead of sapphire kind of clunky
  i hate date dials use a window ffs
were live get in here guys  
  that is fucking disgusting
  literally who  when is the craig show tonight
  craig is a yuppie faggot

sambas  i still regret buying stans
  did you fell into a meme or is there any specific reason
  sneakers are for niggers
  theyre way too bland  sambas have some design going on but at a tasteful minimum
  sambas and alternatively black gazelle
  doc martens  boat shoes  doc martens boat shoes    this fashion thingy probably isnt for you m8
  just get converse chucks the only sneaker that actually looks good
  sambas or continental 80s desu
  are you sure
   ugly ass chunky sole  definitely
  looks good
  i own a pair of gazelles beaten to shit and im thinking on buying a pair of sambas
  how long did you wear it is it durable as they said
  gazelle or maybe samba
  looool hahahahh oh my gid hahahahah
gazelles godtier colorway below
  a little more than a year they are still in the wearable spectrum though and considering they are not expensive id say you get what you pay for vans last me like 6 months for comparison
  bowtie spins  honks nose
  sambas or hamburgs
  top left or top right would age well
  id on the bottom left
  i regret buying sambas desu
id on top right     t lurker
  why
    this guy knows    black gazelles especially with the vintage sole if you can find em are the true adidas goat literally parable with anything
  stans are good mine lasted 3 years before i donated them sambas are good too but i personally think the black version looks better      just buy gats instead
  it says stan smith right on the shoe
  i was going to say the continentals but you might as well just get superior club 85s    those campus sneakers are comfy as fuck though wish it was available in blue i got the black ones but theyre difficult to match because its black suede
  this
  samba black  kind of wish i picked these instead of gats but whatever
og sambas but where are gats
  see i wish i could have gotten gats instead of my sambas since i loved my last pair before they got destroyed but i feel ya sambas w/ suede is closeish though
  why not both sambas are like forty bucks i have the black sambas active wear gym and the white bw army casual
black and white stans
  if i was forced to pic one of those i would go with ss  go full bowie on them
  ohnononononono
  what do you mean by vintage sole
  chucks  good    pick one
  i think those ss are primeknit though
  campus
dont be a poorfag and get black sambas and off white continentals
  those look like the school shoes kids wear with their uniforms in my country horrible
a bunch of people at my university have been wearing continental 80s and they are growing on me a bit
  at least i went to public school in murica where i didnt have to deal with uniforms
  continental 80s
  im glad i bought my gazelles i bought them because i was on a big rainbow 6 seige binge and one of the german operators wore a pair super comfortable and they pair with anything im glad something postive came out of my autism
i dont know shit about gats but i like how they look where am i supposed to buy them
  lmao
not gats
let it out /fa/
wish i was taller /
is there any way to make my penis smaller shit bums me out
a girl will never truly like me because of my physical appearance   thanks god
  
i dont understand i want to stop having low self esteem and anxiety but for some reason i dont take any step towards achieving that i know what i have to do to get betterwhy cant i just do it  tfw brainlet
  external locus of control
  i dont find anything fun
i ordered shoes that are half a size too big and now im stuck with them
  cant return
  i can do an exchange at a store but im not sure if the store actually has the ones that i ordered online
  i ruined my life  im weak
  maybe another location not sure what the exact situation is but shitty regardless
  i did this but with a size too small /
  according to google the next closest one is 25 hours away ill just stuff them with tissue or something i fucking hate my life
  sam here anon fellow 57 manlet who dresses really well but i feel like my outfits would look so much better if i was at least 510 
  i wish my genetics where worse haha
  what are they also id be really surprised if you couldnt ship to exchange
  better too big than too small anon do they actually feel too big or do they just look too big
im going to call in the morning and see what my options are
  they look just fine but my toes dont quite reach where they should
i now look great but i have a personally that women dont like
  spent a grand during black friday weekend online excited  choose 3 day shipping since its free  shipped on monday morning items in transit  canadian postal workers go on strike on tuesday 12am midnight  items now not in transit expected delivery unknown  why didnt i just choose 1day shipping it literally cost 20
  if youre dropping a rack an extra twenty isnt even a question
thinking about buying item  waits too long to make a decision  finally decides to buy  sold out  tfw i shouldve brought it earlier
  just double sock it youll be fine
  heel liners
my face is very asymmetrical and i want to die
i hate my inability to talk to women i went down to london last week and had 2 solid chances to speak to girls who were actually interested in me i feel like shit about it but its given me an incentive to improve myself and i shall try again i just couldnt think of the right words to say and it kills me that afterwards i knew exactly what to say which is basically just hi
  can look rugged and aggressive some girls dig it you should start dressing to fit it more relaxed and scummy
  theyre just people like you and me mane  nothing to be afraid of  also the majority of people have some form of social anxiety even if it doesnt seem like it  keep trying 
  que sera if it was too big on your waist why buy it its just phantom regret
  thanks man first time ive actually felt so shitty about something like this so its probably time i start doing something about it looking at doing salsa classes or something to boost my confidence abit
  i have a babyface at 22 its not happening for awhile 
  how can you be sure all women dont like your personality seems like youre shooting yourself in the foot there mate which makes it understandable as to why you think you wont get on with people   aint the womans fault she doesnt know you only you know you and youre stopping yourself by having such negative attitudes
  just look them straight in the eye speak clearly dont let you voice falter  id strongly recommend doing literally anything that forces you out of comfort zone and into a social situation  even if youre out grocery shopping or anywhere similar just try and chat up the female clerk scanning your stuff  over time youll start to get comfortable with and continue building courage  im rooting for you and everyone else that struggles like this
  good advice ill stop using the self service scanners in shops its annoying i feel like i can hold a conversation well but i just cant initiate which girls seem to need you to do life would be much easier if girls started conversion with guys but i guess im not of that level of attractiveness     thanks for the suggestions im going to take a proactive view on this from now on
  i had that exact feeling but not this time this time i jumped into the future saw myself having that feeling and i added to cart and checked out then later i was looking at it and it was sold out but instead of feeling like i missed out i realized i had bought it you have to go forward into the future to see if you will have that regret feeling or if you have the bad feeling i had the bad feeling also where i buy and immediately regret there will be another sale in a couple weeks before christmas dont worry then another after boxing day
im pretty hot dress really well for my shitty flyover state and have a good personality/know how to talk to people only thing is im a talentless hack coasting through engineering school bc math comes to me easy all i want to do is create by im way to adhd to ever stick to something long enough to become decent its starting to give me a huge inferiority complex
  why dont you cop a script for that self diagnosed adhd like the majority of this complacent shit hole country
  i did in hs after like a year it made me feel like utter fucking garbage on the comedown maybe i should just suck it up and use again it probably would help thanks for the idea anon
  be wary of what youre doing for sure ritalin and adderall are absolutely beyond horrible for your body but if you feel like its worth it go for it
  thank you anon you are a good person
  it sorta feels worth but my body has been taking a lot of damage for the past few years as it is my light smoking habit and god awful diet are starting to make me feel physical pain
i hate my personality  tfw im the funny friend  tfe try to be serious but everyone laughs at me
  how old are you im assuming older than 18 but younger than 25 if youre still in school
  im 21 anon
no matter how nice i dress how nice i look or how nice i am it will never change how much my pathetic height cancels out all of those
im so anti social that i cant hold a serious conversation for longer than 2 minutes all i can do is meme and talk about the same 2 topics
  oof ive been through this it takes a lot of work but you essentially have to completely rebrand it helps if you can meet new people who dont have preconceived notions about you   its not an awful position to be in anon at least you are funny which in my experience can take you a long way once you do start to become more serious just whatever you do dont make jokes are your own expense thats not cool yo
  stop this please
  take the doctors advice seriously it can do a lot of damage while youre still developing    how tall are you    whats the other topic
  51  dont bother saying shit about puberty im well beyond that
  post pics 51 is kinda cute
  seconding post pics for mommy
  i wasnt going to anyway i think anyone thats more than below average should just work on their confidence height isnt everything after all
  music but i always feel condescending i think my problem is im consistently negative i cant help but complain or always see the glass half empty
  hey man im same the way i have interest in a few more things but im always negative i just dont complain about shit
i fell for the common projects meme
  its ok anon at least you now realize it was just a meme have a paw
i have a 5head that shows when the wind blows my hair out of place which is all the time where i live and i cant pull off the aesthetic im going for because of it thinking of shaving it all off but the people around me say ill look worse if i do also been binging on candies recently and noticing the skinnyfat roll in just wish my hairline was nice baka
i bought a huge black trenchcoat and a fucking cape on a kilosale last week thought they looked different and its fun so why not im so fucking dumb who made me this stupid i can do a school shooting and defeat sauron on the next day
  just cut those bangs dog    i dont know what the hell a kilosale is but why dont you just return them
  you dont have a fivehead though
  its a vintage sale the price is by kilo its used clothing so i cant
  then it surely couldnt have been that expensive right the sales like that here are usually like 25 cents or a dollar a pound id just toss them and forget about it
  looks masculine embrace it slick it back
  this is shit advice
used to bike a lot so heavy legs and wimp upper body  be poorfag in poorfag shithole  literally no regular or straight fit pants in available shops fit my ass tights and calves  wear cheap jeans from bazaar that look like shit  my only gray pants are getting torn  every time i get reminded about this i feel like crying
  just take them to a tailor and have them tapered super cheap and definitely worth it
  post ass pics
  start drinking and smoking more frequently it will fuck up your skin and make you look older
life is pointless    i have completed my collection of designer pieces  i have a cute girlfriend  i have money  still want to kill myself    everything is pointless not even depressed
  there is no such thing your face doesnt look great you are just an aspie fashioncel  your face is is your personality to women
  fuck brah thats rough  if i woke up and was 51 i dont think id even last a week
  what is wrong with you   i wish i was poorer lol  i wish i was in poorer health lol  i wish i was homeless lol  i wish i wasnt white lol
  just wish i was skinny    if i dont land this job to pay this semester of tuition im going to have to wait another whole ass year to finally graduate
  i have moobs and i fear they are not just fat but glandular tissue as well so my only hope of ever becoming effay is by way of surgery
  im only into fashion because im ugly but no matter how nice i dress im still a virgin
  like how bad i mean im 54 and rather ugly in the face i can put on nice clothes and only look like a freak in nice clothes thats been why i dont even try at dressing good so tell me why you want bad genetics
i cant match the flame in my girlfriends eyes  i love her but the fiery passion i felt toward the one before her left my emotions reduced to cinders   it feels like im cheating on her  i finally have a girl i can proudly call my own one that i dreamed of for years yet in the end i resort to lies   why does the ride never end anons why cant i just force myself to be happy i just want to be happy
  buy athletic fit from the gap or old navy i have the same problem from the sports/lifting i do and they fit really well
  35 per kilo thats 66 for the two pieces its not that its a huge amount of money but it stings just how fucking shit my taste is
  yeah iktf people expect you to always be funny then in the end you start worrying if youre just actually the butt of other peoples jokes and they dont actually like you
  not even depressed  i think maybe you are but thats ok you can still get help 
apparently i have hpv and im terrified to go to the doctor on the chance i have something else i didnt know about
  aids
  probably double aids
  but doctor i am pagliacci
  is this an insult i googled it and i relate   how to escape this feel
    if it helps a pretty big percentage of ppl have hpv
  not an insult someone above mentioned rebranding and that seems like a solid option sadly being a funnyman really cripples your support system since your actions/feelings are eventually viewed as cartoonish /
im fat
have gyno  started gaining muscle and probably a bit of fat want to get bigger but it means all my clothes will start not fitting tshirts are getting a bit tight already   recently shaved my beard off because i dont need a beard to be manly but its only hammered home that i have no chin and a bit of an overbite so either i have to hide behind a beard as a cope or hate my reflection/photos of me for the rest of my life
  then hate yourself as you are not live a lie you are doing the right thing in the long run youll thank yourself later
with an improved fashion sense started getting more attention  but it didnt stop and now im getting too much attention  i cant compliment people anymore or they go on a fad about how if you say it it must mean a lot and they start an entire scene about how even i complimented them  my coworkers think that id believe id be too good for them they never ask me for any favors treat me like id be some sort of supervisor  girls think id be out of their league they downtalk other guys when we see them and tell me how this or that would be wannabe me or how he cant pull off something like i do i cant ask them out either a girl i actually had a crush on before responded that im too nice to her and shouldnt give her false hope after i literally said i would totally go out with you  i cant have lazy days anymore im afraid to go even grocery shopping underdressed and scared that once i stop it all comes tumbling down  i dont find time for videogames anymore because all i do online is browse webstores or read fashion related news/articles   im getting addicted to nosespray because i now think i couldnt allow myself to have a stuffy nose in public  the only reason i went to this board years ago was because i wanted to stop being depressed all the time and wanted to socialise with people again  i started out isolated but now im isolated at the other end of the line people now talk to me but im not part of them   for me nothing changed i dont feel good at all
  but if a bit of facial hair legitimately makes me look better isnt that preferable all round
  just chill out
  im the same way i know exactly how long i can talk to people for usually 5 mins for friends 12 for strangers and im always aware of it
  mine is about that big and im planning on buzzing after work just do it even if it looks bad
  kekd
i dont know how to pair tops and bottoms so im thinking of only wearing dresses for the rest of my life even though it makes me look lazy
  if you agree with the philosophy that women wearing makeup maybe plastic surgery is still who they are/what they look like undernearth    i personally deal with what ive been dealt and accept/love myself for how i am no matter what but i understand not everyone agrees with that    if you think it looks better and doesnt bother you then why not
im fucked ive wasted so much of my life
  not the person you replied to but you remind me of past me i have gotten a lot better by forcing myself into these situations doing stuff i wouldnt normally do just to get more social interaction you mentioned proactivity which reminded me of the book im currently reading 7 habits of highly effective people which sounds like your usual self help crap with 7 magic tricks to turn your life around but actually is the very opposite bestseller from 97 so you know its not a fad have read 20 and it sounds great so far maybe even lifechanging
  update i can exchange them for a smaller pair but the fucking shoes wont be here until next tuesday i hope to god they arent out of stock online by then
im 22 56 and babyfaced i wish i was taller and looked like a man
  transition 
  sorry im not mentally ill otherwise i would
  ignored again  ay fuck you mang
ordered a stapler  ordered a bigger stapler because i need to staple big  have two staplers
im not confident
  id rather be mentally ill than be 56
going to a big clubnight this weekend  ordered 2 pairs of boots a while ago  mfw none of them arrived yet  mfw will have to wear old ones that splatter the back of my legs with dirt while walking    i really hope im wont need to walk outside in the muddy snow    bonus feel   hope that drugs will make my social anxiety go away and make me forget about how shitty the past year has been
i do really well with women when i get a chance but i am basically never in a situation where i can meet new girls obviously i want a gf but also meeting new girls is fun even if nothing comes of it and i feel like im missing out
i still have acne well into my twenties and my hair is thinning rapidly pretty sure i will end it in the next year
i have body dysphoria and i get sad every time i look in the mirror even though i have am objectively amazing wardrobe
  me too i have many things to talk about but i hate everyone around me well perhaps not hate but i dislike their personalities and most people just bore me
    ordered one of those things that looked really good in photos but looked kinda shit on video only way to find out is to see it live which will be tomorrow wish me luck
  im sure you would
i were always aware about my bottom part of the body being somehow wrong around 15 ive realized that i have wide hips it has been almost 11 years and i still cant get over it it became some kind of trauma and ruined my life
  same problem   also balding worse than 90 of this board and am only 19
i want to develop deep connections with people around me and develop meaningful friendships but i fear i dislike people too much to actually go through with it i get the urge to do so many social things but then when presented the chance to do it i find reasons not to or look down on it for whatever reason i hate who i am
  how old are you    you sound like me when i was younger at some point i realized that i only wanted to fit into some kind of socialization and never really saw any sense in it myself i realized that i do not really enjoy human company and social rituals i do not need to associate myself with any kind of culture or grouping 90 of people are plain idiots and not worth my time anyway
  underrated post
im such an awkward size that literally everything is a little too big or a little too small and i have thin receding hair and shit style and cant afford clothes and im the wrong gender and cant disappoint my family by transitioning and my meds are making me fat and im afriad i lied to myself for so long i started to believe it and im not actually ill and my memory is going to shit and im as dumb as a rock and i hate myself and want to die every day  at least ive got music to listen to
  kek
its too late to transition
i come off as really aggressive and blunt even though im just trying to be honest and truthful like when people come to me with issues i will tell them my opinion even if it means i have to tell the person who came to me for help that they were in the wrong    sometimes i wonder if its even my problem or if people are just used to be coddled with continuous white lies to maintain social normalcy    im sick of people asking how are you and when i give any response that isnt good they look at me like i just spat in their coffee
  i want to develop deep connections with people around me and develop meaningful friendships  i feel that one bro
bi  lived in two pretty gay places  still never had bf
  was in this situation    gave up on money to persue a nicer life   gave up on designer clothes and standing out started buying basics   gave up on girlfriend didnt break up havent had sex in months   still think about killing myself    eh suicidal thoughts might just be normal i think if they arent then maybe they just come with the territory of diverse perspective    i wish something good would happen to me something with really low probability but high value a miracle like people suddenly start understanding my art or i become famous or something but i know the probability is zero
  you sound like a teenager
  just wanna be 57 twink so i can wear literally anything on the planet i want its annoying when youre trying to go androgynous and youre 66 350lbs and literally nothing fits
  aesthetic reasons youre not in my position so you really cant comment on anytrhing
  slide queen
  yea i guess but its just really jarring to find out  really has tore me up to be honest
  what

im planning to ask someone out later today weve spoken before albeit briefly due to having a mutual friend i dont have my hopes up theres no need to get ahead of myself but im not doubting myself its just that ive been alone for so many years and i cant bare it yes i have all of these clothes all of this music all of this stuff but it cant replace human touch    heres to hoping all goes well for not only me but the rest of you in this thread both posters and lurkers
tfw pretty blatant twink  tfw no chad bf to ruffle my hair    i think i might have resting bitch face or something

im too poor to be effay and ive gained so much weight that almost all my clothes are too tight for me also im a kissless virgin failure

  retard
  too poor  thrift stores can have a lot of good /fa/ stuff    gained so much weight  eat more veggies and less sugar exercise always eat slightly less than you want to    kissless virgin failure  be excellent and confident you can do this
  too poor to be effay  nonsense
  nearly no women think calling someone a fagget is a funny insult  /
  tfw 52  im with you brother  all you have to do is get fit and gain some confidence also make sure you buy clothes that fit you properly i was a short chubby kid and i overcompensated for my stature by hiding my body with baggy clothes looking back its one of the worst choices i made and i had to buy all new clothes once i realized my wrongs
  do this   do you put on an act in front of other people i dont have the same popular person issues as you but i always felt alienated from others because i always tried to act like someone else in front of them i would constantly feel on edge to the point where even just sitting in class would make me uncomfortable because i was worried what other people were thinking about me i used to think be yourself was shit advice that belonged in hallmark movies until i started doing it fuck everyone else and be genuine dont know if thatll help but it worked for me and im doing a little better now
need winter boots  see cool non winter boots on sale  dont need them  really want them  everyone says they look dumb  after days of them sitting in the cart i wake up in the middle of the night and buy them impulsively  still need snow boots  tfw
  im 510 and have a 30 inch sleeve if that all jackets and most shirts are 4 inches too long in the arms its either getting things with cuffs on the end or tailoring
  anon people dont want your help they just want someone to listen while they vent most of the time they already know how to handle their problems its just cathartic to tell someone else about it and how are you is almost always rhetorical these are hidden social cues youre supposed to be picking up on    imagine if i walk into work one day and my boss goes how are you anon while walking past and i just stop and go not so great my cat died and my grandma is in the hospital and my gf cheated on me that would be incredibly inappropriate just nod and say good you dont burden others
  you sound autistic if you cant understand social nuances like how are you you really have no right to get mad at everyone else in the country for doing it differently
  i would only tell people who i know well or care about the absolute truth if they ask how youre doing

8lbs overweight and looking like a pig and seeing old skelly photos of myself makes me want to scream
  often they might not know how to fix their situation i worked as a salesman so id argue i know well how people behave and what they seek however often they dont know what they really seek and constructive feedback and advice can be better for them in the long term than comforting words especially if you have experienced exactly the same as others
  are you chubby/skinny fat     even if it is gyno youd be surprised by how much difference shedding a few pounds can make i dropped a 510kg in a short period of time a few years back when i started hitting the gym and my chest looked flat as a board when i had clothes on which was a marked improvement over what it looked like before    and if you do hit the gym prioritise your upper chest
  it didnt she gave me her number problem is she really cant hold a conversation and as much as i try to keep it flowing it doesnt really go anywhere turns out shes like that with everyone so i didnt take it personal thats life it is how it is yknow cant say im not a tad bit bummed out though
  bro conversation is a skill just like anything else man      on one hand it means that you might be a lot worse off the bat then others but on the other hand it means its something that can be improved    check out some books on talking to people/making connections i dont mean pick up artist bullshit i mean more like books directed at business connections and the likes  the underlying concepts are the same    also practice bruv just shoot your shot and get rejected over time youll get better so why not start now

  ive lost 30 lbs but need to lose another 30 but im being a fat fuck and cant stop eating because im always surrounded by people at social events
manlet with a normal torso and short legs is suffering    i only look normal from the waist up
move to la  plan to radically change life eat healthy work out dress better go to uni and pursue career  one semester in no friends still eating junk food and playing video games all day do nothing but work wageslave job and go to school to keep head above water    how do i get out of the meat grinder bois
im sick and tired of being fat im trying really god damn hard to cut the weight and ive been making progress but the transition is so fucking hard i cant tuck in shirts without muffin topping everywhere and looking like a lump of shit i cant wear tshirts without boobing out everywhere god i just fucking hate it i want to die every time i see myself in the mirror
      literally the answer to all of your problems is go on an ec stack avoid it if you have any heart/cardio issues
  im really not fat maybe a bit chubby but my problem is moreso lack of motivation i looked into ec stack though and it does sound interesting
i love clothes because they hide the moles i have all over my chest its my biggest insecurity
  ec stacks do nothing for people that are actually fat all they do is give normal people a bit of an edge if youre the type of person that eats cake because they feel sad or are retarded and dont know that soda makes you fat then taking some gas station adderall isnt really going to help it probably only helps you burn an extra 100cal anyways
  delete tinder
  this is the first transition ive seen which i wouldnt look twice at
go to work go home have no life havent had gf since high school 8 years ago stuck in a rut and never get myself out of it
  i wish i was a baller
  you understand that ec stacks are powerfull appetite suppressants too right thats the biggest reason people even take it because adderall is superior for mental focus youre right that it doesnt fix the mental aspect of overeating but it at least eliminates all physical and metabolic desire for food and that counts for something and will make restricting easier      my problem is moreso lack of motivation  sounds like something that eliminates physical need for hunger and provides your cns with consistent increased stimulation and energy to focus might be something that you want like an ec stack
  i did too ruined my life as a woman dad told me today all i have to look forward to in life is being on the production line at a plant no prince charming for me 
current gf is a legit art hoe   only merit being that she is a weeb like me and has loaded parents  my parents hate her so much but the sex is the best ive ever had    bros
  wtf is the problem
  post pic or youre larping
  theres no problem youre just bragging
im going to lose the only true friend ive got we dont talk much to begin with due to my nature im impulsive miserable and routinely trash their taste in everything i dont know why i do it its because im angry with myself most likely so i project it out onto them ive admitted things to them which make me seem like a heartless bastard theyre the last friend of mine i cant seem to form bonds with new people either  im to blame and yet i cant resolve the problem at hand
the look people give me for having tattoos that you cant cover makes me feel more human
super cute and effay girl shes been scouted by local modeling agencies in one of my classes seems to be really into me but our last class is on thursday so if i dont grow some balls and ask her out within a week i may never see her again i should have done something a while ago but im super insecureive never actually asked anyone out before
        can i join the discord as well
  i like this girl a lot and its fucking scary because she likes me too and im always thinking about her and we go on dates and its the best time of my life and now when im not with her i feel like shit and just constantly thinking about her and i dont wanna smother her and ruin it i also wish i was taller im one inch away from 6ft and my fucking dad hates me and i wanna cut ties but my mom died and i cant because the thought of life without him is more terrifying than death becasue he is all i have
have really bad social anxiety   never had friends and only talked with people on sites like 4chan and gamefaqs  father is sympathetic and has constantly made the effort to try and be my only friend  open up a bit from time spent with him  hes always been interested in fashion and has a pretty good collection of burberry garments  has several made in england trenches   gives me one   whatthefuckamisupposedtodowiththisgif  come to /fa/ and lurk for years  use this as a foundation for my style  fell heavy for the norse projects and over all scandinavian minimalist meme  father is legitimately impressed with my fits   takes me to a friend of his that owns a boutique / consignment shop  gives me a fw08 alexander mcqueen knit sweater for free  since then ive gotten a job there and have used it as a way to overcome my anxiety and develop social skills  father has this shining sense of accomplishment in him and im so glad to not have let him down    my style hasnt really changed since but i do kind of look back on it and cringe    fuck acne studios though
  what do you look back on and cringe about this is legitimately cool good for you man 
tinder  match with qt asian girl  go to her dorm and snoop through her closet while she changes   its all aritzia and tna yoga garbage  hints of f21 and hm  kinda disgusted but fuck her anyways   nut in the direction of her closet out of spite  she doesnt even care    good pussy
  you literally just detailed having sex with a girl and enjoying it but im convinced youre gay
be me 17  shy so i dont know many people  hear from my buddy that a 2/10 is going to ask me to prom today  get out of class  pass 6/10 on stairwell  never seen her before  say fuck it and ask her to prom right there no plan  she says yes  hell_yeahjpg  we end up dating for 2 years   we break up when i leave for uni  still dont know how to meet girls  not ugly but i have acne  no confidence in social situations with new people    how do i stop being a shy beta
  god damn talking to people male or female or otherwise is so fucking easy literally look them in the eye speak clearly and dont let your voice falter thats fucking it almost every other person on the planet has some kind of social anxiety even if its not noticeable or prevalent it really helps if you have a good sense of humor or can speak in a generally lighthearted tone but thats not some major deal breaker nobody is going to laugh in your face nobody is going to point and make fun of you nobody is going to publicly crucify you for talking to them just walk up to somebody and say whats up its that simple
  ec stacks are hardly appetite suppressants if you have a shit mental state that you eat cakes to make yourself feel better youl still eat on a stack its not some magic pill
painted my nails because i think it looks cool on both guys and girls got weird stares all day then realized i had to remove it before thanksgiving so my family wouldnt make fun of me even more

i just want a good pair of pants
  how do i stop having anxiety    i dont know face your fears learn from them stop identifying with it and making everything about yourself get off 4chan pretty much everyone has issues with it and everyone learns from it

  its ok anon focus on the positive things you have in your life
  you are not supposed to be on this site you  this is over 18 website jesuss fucking christ kill yourself
  start taking antidepressants for anxiety
feels like my relationship with my internet girlfriend is all take and no give  she doesnt even want to do basic favors for me when she has nothing else to do despite those favors having the ability to alleviate stress on me  ive tried talking to her about it and she just doesnt say anything and doesnt take anything on board
  is this word salad just complaining your egf wont send you lewds hahaha holy shit dude
      im in the same position but for me it feels like i know i wont be happy if i had the things i dont like money gf meaningful job i like etc i have low self worth and believe even if i had high self worth and believed i was a valuable human being i would still be unhappy so i exist in limbo
im a grill who isnt ugly but isnt beautiful either    finding a good bf is hard    all i want is someone above my league intellect / culture wise looks i can do without    but nope no luck
  i have something similar came into college a kissless pathetic virgin thought after i had my first kiss i would be happy but ended up giving me temporary happiness thought after getting laid i would be happy same thing girlfriend same thing internship same thing i think that at the end of the day life is about trying to fill up the void with temporary happiness life is suffering and happiness is just a pit stop in life
  hopefully we will die soon instead of having to figure out how to an hero in the future brother

  suicidal thoughts are not normal but you can have them without being depressed i think it may be genetic for certain men to want to die but i have no proof

  legitimately heartwarming
  how exactly would you plan to find these smart people
  she saw a whatsapp chat of me talking to my best friend girl and went crazy  but i think thats just an excuse and she just wanted out without it being her fault  the worst part is that she left in the night while i was asleep next to her woke up alone    i dont think she cares that much bro
  you can fix some of those things at least  keep your head up bro

i am envious of a close friend shes more fashionable than me wealthier than me has more connections than me and so on and so forth she isnt even attractive but knows her angles her lighting or what have you so it doesnt even matter shes constantly being showered in attention compliments everything i cant take it anymore i have to do something about it shes trusted me with very personal quite embarrassing information no one else knows regarding her feelings insecurities and things like that ive been considering spreading that information around on the other hand ive been thinking of other malicious acts dont worry cia  fbi im not talking about murder just shit to make her fuck off for good she suffers from depression and similar illnesses as is maybe i could exploit her emotionally and suck her ass dry then leave her to rot on the roadside she has no idea that im resentful of her with every morsel in my body god i cant even stand seeing her in person i just want to fucking rip her skin off that flat fucking face of hers so much for being a doll so much for being so fine so much for being pretty or whatever fucking shit people tell her its driving me fucking crazy  something has to be done
  want to dress well year round and have fun with my family and friends  live in florida so i have to wear a shirt and shorts 99 of the time  parents are lazy poor and disabled  never been good at making friends    it feels like no one ever does anything do people even care about anything anymore i just wanted to live a nice life i guess i can still provide that to my kids if i ever have any but i feel like ive been cheated out of a lot everything feels dull
  floridas widely agreed to be the worst state in the union for many reasons  have you considered moving away and caring about something yourself generally that will attract other people who care about things  that being said 95 of people on earth are in it for a quick fuck or a quick buck
  i have been keeping note of her problems usually shell rant and let it all out at once i have nearly everything come to think of it but i know theres more she isnt telling me ive yet to coax that out of her soon i will ranging from her fathers alcoholism to her fear of romantic relationships oh cant forget the time she popped a ton of pills passed out and woke up in some losers bed that was a good one i made sure to keep that one underlined shes totally clueless of this as far as she knows im a supportive friend someone to rant to someone who cares ive collected all of this information down to the minuscule things and yet i havent found a purpose for it somethings got to give obviously i cant physically harm her i mean ive gotten her to side against a childhood friend of hers with no biggie so maybe things arent as bleak as i thought maybe under the guise of drinking ill accidentally spill some of her close kept information to gossipy friends especially some who arent all too favorable of her its all i think about i sit up at night contemplating how ill fuck her over im deserving of the praise she receives from others im deserving of the attention im deserving of the friendships im deserving of the connections im deserving of everything
                we all gonna make it brehs hit the gym regularly and testosterone rise alone will make it feel much easier physical gains will transform into social gains keep on grinding

    take a long hard look at yourself in the mirror and realise maybe you are the fuckhead what a shit friend you are how dare you say you are a close friend to this women dont you fucking go playing with other peoples lives you cunt work on yourself instead of trying to bring other down with you because you are a petty jealous bitch one day you might grow up and realise hey i dont like this person im just gonna stop being friends with them not hey i dont like this person im going to ruin there life because im jealous you havent done anything yet you can still be redeemed but jesus fuck look at yourself
  ask if they can hold a pair for you    also half a size is fuck all why are you so butthurt
i feel very sad i want to see my family and my old friends but im stuck in a city far away
  youre legit a fucking retard learn to read dumb fuck kys
  fundamentally an egoists dream would also be his enemy because whilst making everything possible you also make it possible for everyone else to fuck you     i cant speak for all men but i find that if ambitious men were not romantic then they would kill themselves its society which gives men this halfhearted idea of such a romanticism being eventually requited that they do not kill themselves precisely to create fugue states in them to remain alive and subservient towards society and its protection i was pleased to get rousseauian i find his views equally endearing the danger with a complete acknowledgement of nihilism is that youre inclined to forget why exactly people invented morals in the first place once you figure out the choice you have of what you choose to protect you can strip yourself of the inclinations to protect what is expected and focus on the protection of things you value ie the goal is to put your higher values in a freezer and let the detritus rot
  lmao u crazy like actually crazy not even crazy people as crazy as u
  fat
    these words are too big for a brainlet like me what kind of person am i
tfw ywn be a tall handsome chad with broad shoulders and narrow hips   whats the point
  i cant say i believe that most men are decent until too heavily influenced by society   the most important thing you can do is retain your ambitions and not flinch under pressure

    please seek mental help immediately
  do it man try to imagine the convo first obviously dont make a full plan but visualising how it could go at the start does make it easier i think when u do that imagine the whole scene  your surroundings yours and her body langage etc    here is my quite comical story  three years ago i missed the opportunity to talk to this girl at university who seemed to be into me kept smiling shyly staring etc during the whole year i thought i would somehow end up talking to her but every time i saw her i was in absolute panic i havent forgot her man three fucking years i guess thats what u call a limerence but it gets better  i actually saw her twice  in another university my current one this september the first time she smiled and looked away and i noticed the resemblance 5 min later not really believing it was her yet i was hoping a week later she was sitting in the last row of my amphitheater and i got completely shook seeing her i went to the toilet to get my shit together and wait for my hands to stop shaking alas some friends were waiting outside and i didnt knew what to say for them to leave me alone so i could fucking finally speak to this girl i think she was waiting in front of the building back turned i couldnt look up to see if it was her when i passed i pretended to care about whatever that girl on my side was saying sperged out again at the time i thought that ill just see her the next day or week since we have this class in common  wrong i havent seen her since a comical couple of plot twists
    ps  remember that if she is into you it doesnt matter if you say the wrong thing mumble or stutter blush or fucking whatever shell be glad u asked and u being shy will simply make her laugh and/or shell think its cute  you cant do anything wrong if she is the right person for you best of luck man how old are you btw
  nihilist and romanic  how do you exist    you also make it possible for everyone else to fuck you   you seem like an intelligent enough egoist to avoid pitfalls like this though no    youre high in altruism spiritualism and asceticism which means you value peoples wellbeing and development
  ill take that complement as humbly as i can however i should note that im not completely in agreement with egoism by nature its a selfish ideology now i dont think thats morally good/bad etc its just an objective i dont think is compatible in the social structure today of course it would be ideal in a time without law like the wild west its almost impossible to succeed without an entourage of a certain kind today that is not to say these entourages should be considered flawless however to suspend others success for your own you need to inevitably sustain that entourage with some kind of prosperity this is where it gets tricky living within the system as an egoist is akin to being a spy that is not aligning with anything so how can you enable others to let you succeed on your own terms its not sustainable because your ends are only accumulated through either the individual or a dictators bent not possible since mussolini etc the most successful egoists are actually enterpriseheavy ceos the difficulty of egoism herein is that the richer you become the more attention you might accrue which spoils your chances of further exploiting your interest without being busted for lack of a better term better still to cater to your goals that already exist within the system than to bother with infractions imagine being an nudist whilst being an egoist i cant imagine a worse fate
   wanting to be white  lol

  honestly the best thing to do is just get to very low bf first you will lose more muscle mass going from for example 14 bf to 20 while bulking then trying to cut 10 in bodyfat while retaining muscle its much more efficient to just get to 10 bulk to 15 then cut to 10
  whatever works for you anon as long as you have a plan i just want to see you make it

  this is me rn i am trying to rekindle or grow into a more mature stage of love i told her everything but she understands its a mutual first relationship ive stopped saying i love her and we broke up for a short amount of time i do love her but not in passion i am reminded of tony sopranos words on tracies death a stripper beat to death by a capo and i feel the same way she was a beautiful innocent creature i dont ever want to hurt her i care so much about her but i feel the relationship is going to end eventually anyway and the fatalist in me is trying to cut to the chase
    for the sake of the girl cut it now either that or take another break

  i am     i want to and i dont shed be the most beautiful wife but i am really a bastard i got this beautiful caring woman on a fluke god gave put a gift in my hands and then set it aflame i think im too immature or maybe just seeking novelty not even love or fulfillment i did the right thing months ago by breaking up with her we were both in morbid hell the absurdist in me says try it fuck it keep going you goon you leering fool life is short and not short enough and having one wife is as good as fucking through a phonebook of nobodies but the fatalist in me is sure of the moment to be forever and so i am torn asunder death upon me love upon her hope on us all
i dont get to wear cool shoes im cursed to wear dad shoes for the rest of my life because my foot requires a rollbar in the shoe and only new balance makes shoes with a rollbar and theyre all so ugly and fuck
  brother bought me a navy blue hugo boss suit for my birthday  never have an occasion to wear it
  rollbar  here are your options  you get the whitest smartest pair of nbs and wear sports casual for the rest of your life  you create your own smart rollbar shoes  you get running like a motherfucker and work out your feet everyday and wear normal shoes
you hear about heroin chic  does that mean heroin use is effay assuming you dont look like the average junkie  cocaine functional alcoholism   what are your personal vices anons  for me its the the three i just listed though i dont inject  inb4 off topic is x effay shit as it is is an accepted thread template here
acid microdoses and ritalin adderal causes brain damage lol
try cyanide its extremely /fa/
  acid microdoses  no way  hallucinogens fun as they are seem to have a very uncool vibe to them  ill admit ive never microdosed what doe shtat shit do  ritalin  could be  stimulants i think in general are makes me think of pkd writing his bullshit for hours on end every day
  thanks anon will look into this
blunts
  wrong
cigarettes absolutely terrible yet you cant look bad smoking one
  actual funkaholism
  true  ive been told i look good smoking them  i thank betty from mad men for teaching me    define actual functional  does missing classes and drunkenly texting family members disallow me form claiming that title  does attending meetings
    hallucinogens fun as they are seem to have a very uncool vibe to them    a tab of acid makes you an autist vegetable sure but 1/15th of a tab makes you a charismatic visionary      only wiggers think blunts are cool
  none substance abuse is for weak people that feel the need to numb themselves to reality    so does ritalin in certain circumstances both are beyond fucked and i cant believe they have the kids here popping them like crazy    420 dude    nicotine is a great drug but cigarettes are not cool im assuming you stole a few from your dad recently
going to get skag  pray for me that its not laced with fentanyl  love you friends not really but /fa/ was my second board so i have some nostalgia  id rather be on /lit///his///int///x/ right now
  im not going to tell you to not do it since that would be fucking dumb but be as safe as possible
drugs only look cool if you are skinny and look and dress good
  microdosing acid is like a stimulant that you dont crash from that said i prefer shrooms for stimmy microdosing acid is introspective cianigger shit that will fry your brain if you dose too often not good to take all the time unlike shroomz
effay drugs    coke  acid  weed only joints though you nigger  xanax
  you should mix all of them together and down a fifth that would be so epic xd
  drugs arent effay
  just snort oxys instead
  can confirm took adderall from like 5yrs old till end of high school and shit fried my brain
sober anon here drank and drugged for ten years got really bad in the last five been clean since january    nothing about it is effay you wake up every day with a hangover you ask why you keep doing this but go right back to it 12 hours later your nose bleeds at random times you stop caring about anything else youre miserable when youre fiending you spend all your money on your doc your family will hate you    and you will gain a lot of weight if booze is your gig totally not effay
  congrats anon youve ascended passed npc and are now unique
  dealer flaked so here i am only drinking  did some h earlier today so i guess maybe a break will be nice  hey im being safe thank you for your concern    are shrooms really that different form lsd ive only tried the latter    yea  this thread was an excuse to talk about drugs i am under no illusion that it is cool  going to an na meeting tomorrow actually being dragged there
  good for you man ive lost many friends in different ways to the shit and its always uplifting to hear someone open to getting clean even if its just going to a meeting    i hope you find serenity my dude
  taar1 agonist brain damage is overstated even when its measurable and really only occurs in the vast majority of people who take it when they abuse it youre stupid if you think mph doesnt have the same neurotoxic effect under the same conditions      both are beyond fucked  messing with your acetylcholine receptors is fine though interesting      that difference is all placebo people cannot tell the difference between acid and psilocin when they dont have access to a clock      listen to this anon
  you hear about heroin chic  does that mean heroin use is effay assuming you dont look like the average junkie  stay the hell away from this and other hardcore opioids if you value your life tired of burying kids you wont escape looking like a pathetic junky  cocaine   the 80s were over 30 years ago nobody likes dealing with hard edge cokeheads in a business environment  functional alcoholism  the age of the 3 martini lunch has past and most workplaces have fit for duty rules that said there is nothing wrong with washing a slow friday afternoon down with a beer  what are your personal vices anons  coffee to get my through the day cognac to take the edge off at night
  cringe and niggerpilled
having done drugs is kinda cool actually being intoxicated is never effay and youre just embarrassing yourself by dumbing down your brain to be a big idiot temporarily
  nothing better than an armchair doctor on an ivory tower
  actually being intoxicated is never effay  yet you have a bunch of kids on this board taking romantic depictions like fear and loathing in las vegas as gospel
  dph
  thats because they havent seen someone seize to death in their arms choking on their own saliva dont get me wrong media involving substance abuse can be really cool but thats because its fiction most people come around eventually
  youre preaching to the choir here cousin choked to death on oxy years ago most of these kids would be looking for a different toy if they actually saw stoners stoned
meth  shrooms acids nerdy  nicotine in a prole way  alcohol has always been fashionable  im predicting crack is gonna have a comeback in the next 10 years so get on that  mdma
  im predicting crack is gonna have a comeback  im curious why you think that i seriously doubt it will ten years ago general cocaine use was cut by almost half in the us but deaths are still rising opiates and their derivatives are the main issue and i think both use and death will continue steadily rising for at least the next decade
protip if you want to take preworkout make sure you actually do workout using it as a booster anywhere else will make you look like an angry asshole
be most attractive friend im aware of in my entire network   be most fashionable  am actual heroin addict  i dont recommend it  but its true
  whew glad you dont recommend it i was literally about to pick up and tie off  weird flex
  no drugs are effay  waah but muh heroin saint lauren paris and jazz music aesthetic  fuck off
  crack is a cheap potent stimulant and i have a bad feeling about the next decade so i think the budget stimulant market is gonna pop off
  protip youre only the third thing degenerate faggot
  microdosing doesnt cause hallucinations you sperg at least read up on it if you havent tried it and want to pretend like you have    its dope as fuck and a huge money saver at festivals since you dont have to buy overpriced drinks all day

except this is basically billy joe armstrong with a peacoat
i love this man
  contributed to the actual birth of punk which has been emulated studied for decades  actually did hard drugs and got into fights lived the real punk lifestyle  was born in the scummiest area of london and hanged out  with the dregs of society playing instruments shitily on the streets for money  went to prison for throwing a glass bottle at a girl in a drug fueled rage  killed his girlfriend then killed himself with a drug od  yeah its billy joe armstrong with a peacoat
he was definitely more of a fashion icon than music icon
  yeah im thinking hes based
johnny rotten
  this is why i overall believe it was a good thing that sid died when he did
  not so smug now are we lydon
  contributed to the actual birth of punk  lmao they are a band created by a brand of clothing as an advertisement sid was musically illiterate and his bass wasnt even connected to the speakers during live shows
  antipsychotic meds bloat your shit and zombify
  johnny rotten said he used to hang upside down in front of his over to get his hair like that apparently in the winter when he got a new shirt he wouldnt wear a jacket so he could show it off and he would freeze his ass off    /fa/ as fuck thats true dedication

  based
  like every nigger the second he makes more money than the local crack dealer
if you take away the hype from most of this mans pieces they look like something youd find off of the zumiez website for 5060 off
  yeah designs are fucking lazy sure you can read as meta or surrealist but basically all his shit comes down to is     x
  i think some of the arguments that hes meta hold some weight in that its blatantly obvious that hes making designs with little effort to make a shitload of money i dont think id wear any ow but i semirespect the obvious hustle hes pulling on hypebeasts and suburban white kids
  dude is mad gud haters will hate
  oh yeah excellent business savvy makes mad money off the backs of rich kids who see fashion as who can spend the most money  good business man shit designer
fucking nigger
  fucking wigger

bump
anyone know exactly what it is he seems to wear the same ensemble every shark tank episode
  i dont trust people who wear charcoal suits its like they wanted to wear a black suit but the store clerk told them they were only for funerals which is correct of course
  i think a black suit is ok if youre a sexy fbi agent desu
  isnt that a black suit though    it looks the same colour as the tie and i doubt there are many charcoal ties out there
  its not the same colour get a better monitor
thoughts on this style
  we cant see her outfit bro
  she looks like she smels pls tell me she braps stinky smelly farts
is this worth the 530/600 euro im considering getting this for myself
  depends on if youre retarded or not
  worth is completely subjective you can find a warm waterproof coat that will last years at a thrift shop for 10 you should put aside questions of durability and practicality when it comes to worth
  i thought about trying to cop one but then i saw the retail prices
  a fleece what do you think you can buy proper insulated hardshells for the half of that or even the third of that  also white fleece is never a good idea it will get dirty and you wont be able to remove stains    its just a piece of the usual tnf x supreme moneygrab    it would be ok for not more than 100 eurobucks
  this is extremely fuccboish but the supreme tnf map expedition is my holy grail for coats
yall right what am i even thinking guess im copping a saint laurent paris jacket
  these collabs dont have any added value by supreme other than branding if you want to pay for a brand name go ahead but dont expect us to justify the decision
600 dollars is chump change
  i really like this one and you could get the supreme tag off this not gonna pay 1k though
  i remember being pissed as fuck when i took the l on the mountain parka while waiting for my next class
what is this style called
gay chad core
sochadicanwearwhateveriwantcore

which tiger stripe camo is the coolest     alternatively which brand tiger camo pants are the best value
  anyone know where to cop those pants specifically tapered with that strap at the bottom to hold the pant down
should i cop picrel for 15    can we have some ts pants inspo
girls can pull off full camo without looking like larping    
i kinda wanted to expand my wardrobe in that direction since i dont really like jeans fabric and too unnatural or bright colours i also really like chinos plus i think that i can combine it pretty well with solid colour milsurp jackets but how much of a sperg would i look if i actually would dress like that
  it is the most effay style there is  but how much of a sperg would i look if i actually would dress like that  idk why you think this it is very normal clothing just with some details button down collars 32inchregular fit chinos saddle shoulder knitwear made in usa or europe exclusively with exception of kamakurashirts no slim fit memes etc ive been dressing like that since 17 in europe and you hardly look out of place
  no slim fit memes  what you posted seems to be slim fit pants      yes go to ivy thread
this is not the ivy league aesthetic though maybe it once was  nowadays its all canada goose and anti social social club n shit
  i think this is the one style that anyone can pull off if they just pay attention to the details  like properly hemmed pants and sleeves if you make the effort to do some minor alterations its great the way people fail at this is incorrect sizing it cant look sloppy
  
whats your ideal fun /fa/ gear
  a noose around my neck before turning thirty
  really why anon is everything ok  you need this
in retrospect how based and redpilled was he
0 degrees on both fronts dude is trying really hard to not care and its painfully obvious to anyone with a modicum of social skill total tryhard who peaked 20 years ago and will never be what he once was the verdict is not /fa/    /thread

basedboy  basedboy  basedboy  onions  onions  onions
3sixteen   ironheart
  iron heart
leather  boots
  for the most part its not his clothes that make him look like a basedboy its the beanie and those stupid thick rimmed glasses that really do him in the pants could fit a little better but the former two are the damning things that all basedboys have  also messanger bags are dumb
pro tip stop caring how other people dress these threads fucking reek of insecurity
  nah m8 i hate the fit that nondescript jeans fit that ugly tee that even uglier overshirt not one but two middling messenger bags
  did you get lost or something do you know where you are
  i know where i am it doesnt mean the cycle of dickless little faggots sperging out constantly has to continue you idiots lose your shit when someone wears a beanie bunch of goddamn retards
  that non descript jean fit  those are regular straight leg jeans  that ugly tee  its just a brown tshirt  that even uglier overshirt  thats a trucker jacket   not one but two middling messenger bags  have you ever traveled before
  like i said not a fan of the jeans either but the rest of the outfit doesnt look basedboy core or whatever it just looks like he threw some shit together which is fine the boots look weird too and i like leather boots on guys   but jesus the more i look at the picture the more i hate the obscene beard beanie glasses and bags
  im pretty sure youre lost do you need me to call your parents
  and i like leather boots on guys  aare you aa girl female
  pretty sure you need to update your prescription for autism pills
  yes i have two x chromosomes and think leather boots look nice on boys but those just look weird
  ookay  is it true you prefer black boots to brown ones
  brown like actual dark brown leather  black leather boots are bleh
that jean fit
  black leather boots are bleh    tell this to the clowns forcing the ugly brown boots meme
  why would i take pills thatgive me autism silly child
  it mostly depends on what color your pants are with how well the color of leather boots is going to look
  but ugly brown boots meme is about suede light brown boots you retard not dark brown leather boots like the femanonmale is talking about
  ugly brown boots is being applied to anything that isnt black by now
  doesnt lift weights  terrible dark giant glasses  terrible beanie  terrible beard  terrible colors    just awful 0/10 why would you take a picture of this
  i dont know him    i just dont like light brown boots like the other anon said suede isnt nice    i do not have a penis and i never have
  what about chelsea boots  suave or gay
  usually what im dressed eeeeeeeeeeeeeeen
  what does suede have do with light brown boots light brown boots can be leather
  the boots in op are also closer to dark brown than lightbrown/tan anyways
  no overemotianal expression  somewhat masculine hands  meme too far tbeh
  best shoes for men imo are penny loafers dark brown derbies white tennis sneakers brogue derby boots and 574s closely behind that imo just my opinion ofc not her though  chelseas are kinda mfatier 2bh
  oh theres no way to please all of you lel    ive met women that told me any kind of brown leather shoe turns them off reminds them of how teacher/lawyers/her uncle and basically men should only ever wear sneakers
  you must be loving the shoes i bought recently
he just looks like a san francisco nobody     you see hundreds of effeminate men like him in that city everyday
slimsixteen  ironfit
  depends the fancy ones are kinda dumb but i understand some guys like them for work or whatever if its a fashion thing theyre kinda dumb but if its what you like whatever    im just specifying those light brown suede ones i just dont like em
  light brown suede  i understand you so much   especially when it reaches yellowish or orange tones ewww
basedboy is an imageboard meme     normies would think hes cute if inoffensive
  thats actually a really nice jacket wtc
  agreed that meme is a reminder of how detached you become from the offline world when you spend too much time on 4chan
  that leather bag hes carrying is like 1000
  except guys like ops pic are exactly the ones who go around shaming and judging so they deserve all the hate they get
  no stop believing everything you read on /pol/
  those jeans fit terribly hes fucking swimming in them
  /pol/ boogeyman  no need ive lived it  and if it wasnt so potent the mods here wouldnt have filtered it would they
she cute
  chaturbate colombian heaux tier
not really she has a great body though
  butterface
  which is worse tho butterface or butterbody asking for a friend
  imo a bad looking face is worse than a bad looking body as one can be changed but the other cant
  this is true
  i havent seen pearchan in ages holy shit
based op
  i agree
butterface with killer body is the kino choice
  tooo funky
  butterface is a bit strong the face ranks lower than the body but is still above average butterface makes me think of the russian girl who looks like john malkovich
  after not seeing her for years this doesnt even look bad at all what the fuck  this looks normal for 2018  she just looks like a plus size model    we live in a society
  
  her face is 10/10 her body makes her 75/10
  the face is still above average  thank god i dont live whereever youre from
  nigga what
  shes from my city and studies medicine here
  did you go to the same school have you ever met her/talked to her
how do i lose fat from my face/neck i have a very low body fat  and im very thin   do i just need to work out or is there something else i have to do if i do have to work out what are some useful exercises     picture not related
i usually put an ice pack in the morning and then do stomach crunches a balanced diet and a rigorous exorcise routine are very important maybe look into a water activated gel cleanser or a honey almond body scrub but for your face definitely use an exfoliating gel scrub i also like to apply an herb mint face mask dont use after shave lotion with alcohol in it
  wait cosmetics how are they supposed to work
bump
  define low bf  or you just got shitty genes and no muscle mass
you cannot target fat loss    you just cant the only way to lose weight from your face is to lose weight overall if youre very thin and youre still chubby in your face then you need to lose even more weight
  get buccal fat removal if your face is still chubby theres no other option op
  from what ive read people notice a big difference in face fat getting to under 20 bmi
  this very easy and simple procedure     i was at the plastic surgeon office last week with my girlfriend and there were a bunch of good looking guys there while i was waiting for her all had strong jaws/nice cheekbones wouldnt be surprised if they had surgery already or were there to get even more they were all young too early 20s to maybe early 30s
  im already under 20
unironically train neck and drink water dont forget to eat some veggies and lean meat
  lol
  how do i train my neck  wont that just make me look retarded being a skeleton with a thick neck
  heres your answer op
  work your shoulders too and do some pushups retard neck doesnt grow in few days too
  kekd
  one of the hardest part to train  what if i build too much muscles anon    5 time more workout than you expect makes tiny amount of muscles
  veggies and lean meat  he fell for the jewish fat is bad and fiber is good propaganda  oh am i laffin
  meat is the only place to get fat   have fun with your arteries
  i will lmao meanwhile you have fun with your insulin resistance and inflammation  
  either shitty genes or  i have a very low body fat  and im very thin   lying ass
    that video ends with him saying to eat vegetables and fish a lean meat he warns against bread and grains as they cause sugar spikes as well as processed oils as they dont fit naturally within your bodys lipid chains    the unsaturated fat myth has been dead for years keep shoveling beef into your mouth to own the jews tho i guess
do you have a mouthbreathers jaw if so its probably why its virtually impossible to lose fat in the facial and neck area surgery is best option in such case
  whats a mouthbreather jaw
  my bmi is 177
  whats your bodyfat percentage fatboi
  i dont fuckin know
  bmi is a meme
  can you see your abs everyone has abs even dyels if you cant see them lose more weight and youll lose it from your face too i am around 1214 body fat and still cant see my abs just the protrusion of the muscle mass underneath i do 100 weighted incline situps 5 days a week and do a ppl routine i am strong by normie standards no abs here neck is beefy after being a pencil for 27 years face and chin fat is gone and you can see the sink below my high cheekbones maybe you have shit genetics

i want to take inspiration from this model namely the boots but i dont know if theyre 8 or 10 inches if they are do you think boots with tuckedin jeans and tuckedin plaid buttonups would work well not looking to chase a fad i just want to look sharp and handymanish    tldr when do 8inch lace boots work in fashion im not trying to look like a soldier but i am wanting to look a sharp as one

  its no different to those fuckers who post anime as inspo though
  inspo thread  final fantasy shit  ends up buying a meme jacket that doesnt fit anyone   please help me /fa/
  lol ikr     also i think cutesy anime is killing western society
  i really dont mind people consuming it but when they transpond anime attitudes to real life i want to kick them in the teeth
  just because its the same doesnt mean its not disgusting      fucking weebs  society
  i totally agree if you want to see what anima does to a mind just look at that whore youtuber presshearttocontinue   bitch is beyond annoying
looks like gats and old school vans fucked to me that being said pretty dope
  the original chimas looked better imo i liked the way the uppers were raised i skated them a bit they were okay not my favorite shoe the 2s are passable in looks like i said i prefer the original but for skating id assume theyre better as they have the duracap and a less shit insole i however have never tried them i take it you actually skate if not then i wouldnt buy skate shoes doesnt make a lot of sense to do so and if you do then i think you can do better i personally really like the suede vulcanized superstars they have these god tier adiease insoles that only like two of adidas skate shoes do if i am correct id check those out if you can get them on sale i got mine half off for 40
  vans are the ultimate basic bitch shoe
  thanks man ive never heard of adidas skating shoes but ill check them out
  i like them maybe they should make a version without the shoe cap for casual wear
  they remind me of macbeths
  at least for the classic models authentics old skools sk8his etc the pro models are in a league of its own imo
  you guys spend all day talking about how art hoes cant dress for shit then turn around and make threads about vans the absolute state of /fa/
  i think its hilarious that when vans got semi popular they were ridiculedas being the fucking poser shoe by actual skateboarders and now the company subtly tries to come off like theyre fucking staple classics as if everyone didnt fucking hate them and the scene trash brokencyde faggots that wore them
  adidas is pretty great for board feel but id go with my etnies marana if im going down something
  holy shit grampa what are you doing here
are you allowed to wear hoodies/sweatshirts with your sherpa truckers
  no i got fined and jailed last time i tried
  obviously you can just got to make sure the sizing is right so the jacket doesnt look like its squeezing you because of the extra layer from the hoodie and that the hoodie doesnt look to packed in its got to look natural but is perfectly normal to do
  technically no but the police usually just let you off with a warning so its no biggie
  in high school math i sat next to an autistic guy every time he was solving a problem he would ask me if what he did was okay like he needed affirmation on every little thing  youre on a whole new level

what the fuck happened to him goddamn

  thats because youre retarded
my boy fucked tom hiddlestons stylist
  t tom hiddleston
  hi tom
  toms getting mogged pretty hard hes an incredibly handsome man but hes upstaged by lacoste man
  early katy was godtier
  bruh guy on left is mad good looks
  incredibly handsome man  lol
think the look can be pulled off in this day of age  or is it too larpy
you have to adapt it probably unless you are a grown man the fact that you are wearing suit pants and dress shoes will throw most people these days and make you stand out the turtleneck isnt very common at all these days also you need to have a manly look or you will just look like a fedora
  its not even pulled off in your pic mosley and his crew look like fucking dweebs the guy on the left looks the best though     you can definitely wear a black turtle neck and black dress pants without looking like a total faggot but avoid the shoulder buttons
bash the fash
  youll probably look just as autistic as anyone else who larps in the uniform of an old school fascist nat soc or communist group
    shoulder buttons  yeah those are pretty gay  i was thinking more of the black turtleneckblackpants look doesnt necessarily have to be suit pants  honestly if youre good looking enough you can basically pull off anything    commies have cool aesthetic too its all cool bro    pic in op isnt as overt as some fuckhead wearing a brownshirt or some weird 60s soviet shit
    you people are toe dirt the whole point of the outfit is that its a fencing jacket its more structured than a turtle neck it has firmer material you replace the fencing jacket with a turtleneck and the slacks with some other casual trousers and the shoes with some work wear basics and suddenly you look like any other faggot with a hint of exentialism and a western style belt buckle and youre wondering why nothing about your outfit even vaguely evokes the same feeling as mosley and crew
    w2c the shirt
  fencing clothing sold in black or get a white one and dye it
fash clothes only work in a fash regime dressing like an ss officer in the kwa looks silly no matter how cool you look
  the guy on the left looks the best though   lookism everybody
  what would be a time appropriate look that has the same implications black army sweater and leather military boots
  i dont think a shitty surplus sweater and peasant bin shoes carry the same implication in any time except maybe the worst possible futures
  hes the only guy to be allowed to wear this because hes good looking with the fitting personality and confidence to make it work unless you are actually knowledgable and have the lifestyle to fit looking like this you shouldnt try
  my biggest issue with this is they are all wearing exactly the same clothes check out reservoir dogs similar style but if you look at the details they are all wearing slightly different clothes even if the overall look is the same
    commies get the rope
  a its a uniform b they arent even all wearing the same
  like  said you have to adapt to it start with one item of clothing and see how it works for you
think the look can be pulled off in this day of age  or is it too larpy
post more of /ourboi/
if you remove the shoulder buttons downsize the belt width by just a bit sure its literally a turtleneck with trousers black on black  timeless
apologies for the shitty lighting and poor choice of undergarments but this is how i tend to dress i actually leave the house like this often because i have genuine autism sometimes wearing a long black skirt instead of the pants
  do you have cute feet
  if you wore something that hugged your body more and accentuated your curves itd not only look better but itd look more feminine maybe add a beret as a nice touch
  i think dylan roof is a retard but unironically hes best dressed out of everyone in pic related
  is it too larpy  unless youre a brit virtually nobody around you would recognize this as the uniform of a fascist party    but youll still look like an edgy fag for wearing all black and tucking a nonbuttoned shirt into pants is kinda odd these days
post more dylan    cute idea pay attention to fit to make it more /fa/ i would say also im not a fan of wrinkly turtleneck maybe mock neck or shorter length in general think about taking in the pants / tapering them a bit i think what appeals to me about the fascist theme is a fit execution and taste awareness combined with purposeful bland clothing so too many trendy or frumpy details detract from it also if it is too edgy it looks larpy but you need a little bit of edge to look intentional
  okay heres the thing   wearing a dark sweater with dark pants isnt any core its babbys first attempt at looking unique pretty much anyone who has gone on to create their own sophisticated style started out like this but you have to recognize that what youre wearing is the fashion equivalent of training wheels

this thread is cringe
  the worst thing about this show is that it was so close to being the most accurate recreation of english schooling but it traded half of it in for completely unrealistic americanised plot catharsis   when it aired as soon as it got merely popular it flanderized every aspect of itself asap     still had some gems that were really accurate  the shit car the guy lying about his sexual conquests ad infinitum getting an underage pint in a pub getting caught for ribbing on a parent younger kids trying to outpunk the elder kids  they should have stuck with the futility of ever being popular as soon as any of them had any remotely sexual encounter it was clear it wasnt being faithful no one but the druggys chavs and whore parents had any action not by coincidence  the bit with charlotte should have ended after the 2nd tease or so i think they included all the exciting / unreal parts so that the kids watching wouldnt shoot themselves but oh well

uk version
is there a more beta/passive haircut than the short back and sides
short back and sides is the name of the cut  jinkies
  not an undercut you mongoloid undercut implies theres some sort of overhang instead of a skin fade     or are you one of these spackas that calls it a hitler youth
  short back and sides detected commencing beatdown
cool ill cut my hair that way every single time then
    samefag
  uh no this however         certainly is all you now kys you mentally dilapidated sack of human waste
        i literally never implied that this was an undercut faggot that picture is of a crew cut jesus christ what an embarrassing thread you should seriously take your own life
  no that would be when they go 3 months without cutting it at all because they fear bantering with a human for 30 minutes

  ugh stop making these threads youre making me not want to buy it anymore
  what do you mean stop making these threads this is the first one ive made because it will cost 43 for one so i was hesitant
honestly seems too pricey for what it is also  buying merch for an album you havent even heard yet
  at least 3 other threads just like this were made about the shirt thought it was the same anon sorry bro you can continue
  yeah it is pretty pricey but at least its good quality   merch for an album you havent even heard yet  we appreciate power is probably my favourite song of hers and the album will most likely be more heavier compared to visions etc

i like how they dress in this movie
vlc  good movie though
  whats wrog with vlc
  ok man we get itdont have to post a screen cap of every single costume in the movie
  i like this movie a lot i want to be the deer hunter
  ill post a cap from vlc and mpv for comparison if you think i am memeing you and manipulating the file try it yourself other reasons i prefer mpv to vlc   you know when the picture pixels up and greys out especially on 1080p videos when starting and navigating around doesnt happen on mpv   mpv has h265 support   ui looks dated and has too many unnecessary features if you are particular about your settings mpv has a config file and commands available   mpv starts almost instantly fastest launching app on my computer next to the calculator desu
the deer hunter is great for the first hour and then gets pretty bad  the immersiveness of the beginning is really well executed however the russianroulette motif and vietnam experience is overdone drawout and unsatisfying regardless of whether you like the costumes or not it certainly isnt one of the best film of the era
this movie was sponsored by holubar
    i dont see any difference
  open the images in different tabs and click between them im guessing youre on mobile since you didnt already do that where the difference is clear
  one is slightly lighter than the other one
  its not slightly the colors have the correct saturation and brightness vlc washes out color this also still doesnt account for the other points i brought up vlc is the worst for this
  who cares faggot
    the mpv cap is just slightly brighter overall

  based secondary keithposter
for me its josh homme and qotsa        strokes are a good choice
  i didnt think anyone else knew about them
  absolutely not
  low test
  his fits are remarkably unremarkable he dresses well but is hardly fashionable its zero risk qotsas boring overcompressed tribute rock is more interesting than his fits their music has been on steady decline since their selftitled      iggy on the other hand is a true maverick and madman
last shadow puppets are pretty based
  stupid image hipsters love qotsa
  wojakjpg defending my point of view  theres a wojak for everything just admit that qotsa is a small step above mediocrity and pat yourself on the back for not posting 
the velvet underground are the quintessential answer everything about them was oozing fashion the stooges are another pick but i choose pic related    rollins was /fa/ in the 80s but greg ginn dressed like a dork    polished post punk is not /fa/    based    numale    based as well    not /fa/ josh only looks good cause hes a chad    overrated
qotsa  but the other four guys are morefa than josh  josh is chad but not fa as mentioned earlier
  agreed on the vu theres no competition
  is he actually larping as david lynch
  the most effay group in history
  yes
  josh always cracked me up because hes around the stoner rock dudes but then he just looks like a gap model
if the band you posted hasnt walked a runway drop them from the thread
  but their music is trash tier
guys dont forget these two
  they really improved desu their last album is so much better than the one before  definitely not for everyone though very eclectic and in your face

    this is so fucked  is right every time i see a picture of a kpop group all of the members look completely identical except for their hair clothes and accessories theyre literally real life equivalents of characters from some shitty harem anime their only distiguishable characteristics are their superficial qualities apart from that theyre told how to act in public and on camera their music is all premade and the music itself only serves as an avenue to plug sponsorships and product placements literally all they have to do is exist and it generates revenue for the label how long until they just start growing these things in labs  i really hope north korea snaps and vaporizes this dystopian hellhole theyd really be doing the world a favor
  just because you cant differentiate between korean faces doesnt mean they all look the same there are some pretty obvious differences especially between the girls compare 5 and 6 for example 5s face is much less angular she has bigger lips and a thinner nose you probably just need to spend more time around asians

big thicc wool sweaters heavy enough to be used as outerwear and dont cost a fortune why is this such a hard item to find
try alibaba
thrift
stop reading hemingway
end of season sales at old mans menswear stores or serious op shop campaigning
chunky wool sweater
  i got a few chapters into the sun also rises then remembered im not a reader is there some connection between hemingway and big jumpers that im not aware of
  he whore them and every lumber sexual fag now loves them
i like my brabour troyer
  its fisherman related
stores like tj maxx are based for cheap and heavy sweaters about the only thing theyre good for picked up a nautica one no branding for 30 recently and i like it a lot
    theyre good for sports/outdoor gear too ive found so many great items there
  im looking more for the functional masculine aesthetic numales with beards piss me off too wool has some great functional properties retains insulation capacity while wet for example i dont even live in the us or like country music but i own cowboy boots im a bit of an eccentric i suppose
post pic i bet its thin shit
  i found that sweater and its minimum order of 12
  they kind of suck to wear irl if you go indoors its too hot and inconvenient to take off
  forgot you might find something at woolovers
  t h i c c
woolovers  arancraft  outdoorknitwear
  the sun is his best book in my opinion its tenderly absurd and the gravity of it only hits you on the last page
  he whore them and every lumber sexual fag now loves them  now  you realise hemmingway died near enough to 60 years ago right are you this dipshit  
  sorry for not being time stable you timeist
  is his war injury his penis being missing he turned down that girl because of his injury so im assuming its his penis
more natural and expensive material from the start  thrice the normal raw materials even need more than a blazer  somehow thin polyester hoodie prices which are the one of the most cheap clothes      good luck
love mine undyed blacksheep wool cant recommend them enough just look for irish/scottish/faroese/icelandic manufacturers etc
  cant hanging a heavy sweater like that fuck up the neck or is it fine maybe im retarded
  ah and forgot to say if 150250 is a fortune to you thrift stores are your only hope personally i think some of these sweaters are a steal for the level of handwork and material quality youre getting     just for the picture its normally stored flat good catch
  if you use a proper sweater hanger like a regular hanger but with grooves/nubs that catch the fabric taking the hanging stress off the neck its ok not as good as folding it on a shelf but ok  source worked in clothes shops
  yes that is a fortune guess ill have to treat the peregrine wool jumper i bought for 25 back in the 90s as a precious item
got my grail in the mail fits perfectly  
allsaints has nice knit sweaters in the 100200 range
  kek
the gap
  its probably made of acrylic or cotton
  sns herning is great and often go on sale
  heavy enough to be used as outerwear  sweaters are not good outerwear theyre not wind proof even a gentle breeze goes right through them
aransweatermarket has those for around 80 i have one and they are highly recommendable
    though not 100 windproof boiled wool items are incredibly effective dachstein mitts are still favoured by alpinists and winter sport enthusiasts they do a variety of wool items

  the intellectual man  gay hypebeast chink cocksucker  actually theres a fabric more cringe than corduroy your skin
  ill have you know that this man had some guys murdered and then buried in quicklime  corduroy is the perfect fabric for the humble working man  hypebeast faggotry is for gay chinks
  yes i work for carol christian poell and the leather jackets are actually made with human skin we just lie and say that is made out of horse or kangaroo skin  youll make a nice pair of drips

when it comes to double riders i feel like the more research i do the harder it becomes to justify a purchase i was wondering if anyone here knows their shit about them and could post their thoughts or first hand experiences
double rider  no such thing the name youre looking for is perfecto
dont buy them
  wearing a biker style leather jacket without riding being in a punk band or having a vagina makes you look like a poser
  bullshit
  sorry dude
  biker style  lol its a cold weather military style you retard wearing a lapelled leather jacket makes you look like a poser if youre not a ww2 vet
wearing jeans without mining being a cowboy or having a farm makes you look like a poser
  thats also true       wearing a tie without having a job makes you look like a poser
wearing designer clothes without being a model makes you look like a poser
  13881468 based
  that would be a nice jacket if not for that crap written on the sleeve i thought cdg was the fancy real brand and only cdg play did the obnoxious meme branding
wearing jeans without a manual labor job wearing chino pants without british or french military experience wearing wool pants without manager position wearing jogger or sweatpants without any cardio daily wearing tech fabric pants without mountaineering a week are posers
leather jacket threads always bring out the fatties and boomers
hush you fools youre going to summon dante    op i bought a perfecto over the summer and im wearing it right now a shortlist of all the advice youre going to see    you need the face  personality to pull one off if you look like a manbaby or slp wannabe youre going to end up in one of those saint threads   youve gotta wear it for a while to let it mold to your body and stop looking factory new   just buy schott everything below that price point is either shitty cheaply made fake leather or an imposter everything above that price point is either mall brand or high fashion which theres nothing wrong with but dont drop 5000 on your first leather jacket if youre not sure youre going to like it    overall its just a piece of clothing wear it with confidence putting it on isnt going to magically turn you into an interesting person or a sex god
  youre not supposed to actually give the op good advice here
  did you just go for a classic perfecto i prefer the english rider shilouyette to the american so i might just settle for a lewis which is the uk equivalent to schott
  you tried
  good points though i would argue that aero and belstaff are also worth looking into at that price point without wavering from the same level of quality
  i got the 613s 618 is the classic as far as i remember but a lot of people say the fit is quite baggy at the waist / underarms schott tends to make their jackets fit for middleaged men 613s is slim fit one star i removed the metal stars from the shoulders because my friends kept giving me shit for how rough rider it looked    if schott made a slim version of the perfecto like the 613s but without the stars it would basically be perfect for me     dont know much about lewis leathers but as general advice when making a big purchase such as this one you should get the original version / maker before looking into remixes and homages
  op id also recommend getting something basic the reason is double riders are the most memed piece of clothing on this board possibly in modern fashion atm and if you cant pull off the basic one then you certainly wont be able to pull off the severalthousanddollar designer version by slp or cdg in your picture pieces like that are worn by cokeaddicted rockstars not doughy twinks with male pattern baldness who lurk on ugandan birdwatching boards
remember this poor boy who got so scared of wearing a leather jacket for the first time he made a thread that got 300 replies
  thats not really cdg thats a lewis leathers jacket with cdg writing and design
    they only look good if youre built well you actually ride a motorcycle play in a band or youre a 2m tall slprunway skinny boi     i only two shitty ones other one was 200 from nahkaalbert and the other is a similarly manufactured jacket i got for 50 at a thrift shop both are made in germany the cowhideleather is thick and the stitchings havent fucked up yet the other is tighter and fits over my shoulders better the other is loose when opened up but if zipped and with a wool sweater underneath its leather teddytime the slimmer one has some buttons on the lapels aswell    if there was only one outfit i could wear all year around provided shit wouldnt break down by use id only wear a pair of black slim jeans steeltoed docs a plain black tshirt and a double rider on top
  with the sweater underneath
i looked at that website that makes the devil may cry jacket and i found something i like are their other jackets decent
    do not fear i am coming
  is this the same guy who made a replica of hellboys jacket
    very good advice overall i agree on the schott too but either get on on ebay for a steal and accept its flaws too baggy classic fit cropped or get one of their newer models that is more suited to the /fa/ standard of perfectos     i went with the former since i aint trying to be slp it just means i had to mind the fit and accept the cropped nature of a classic cut that actually fit correctly in the shoulders and sleeve
  i own this and also a givenchy leather with the same styling twin waist buckles etc    leather jackets for fashion work based primarily on fit     it needs to fit tight and cropped it should be impossible or nearly impossible to zip up and it should end at the belt line ie your whole ass should be uncovered    reasons why they look bad  1 people zip them up  2 theyre too big  3 theyre too long  4 theyre too wide in the shoulders    keep it as small as possible also good leathers will stretch out so if its difficult to wear keep wearing it
  some of what i say reiterates what others have already said here so apologies in advance    1 first thing you have to do is try them on in person leather jackets are difficult to buy online due to sizing but this one is particularly tough to size because different manufacturers cut the jacket differently you have to go from store to store and see what works best for you when you go make sure you wear the clothing combination you plan on wearing with the jacket    2 though they can be paired with just about anything they are a statement in fashion that is iconic and has many connotations unlike a standard cafe racer the doublerider style does not go unnoticed so be aware of this if you dont want undue attention dont wear it    3 you are concerned about justifying the purchase let me tell you a few things about leather to source and buy enough leather for a jacket like this is around 300400 depending on the quality of the leather then to get someone to stitch it together from either another jacket or a pattern is at the lowest around 200 so thats 600 right there schott perfectos on their website start at 800 consider that fact leather jackets are expensive because a the quality of the material used  b the quality of manufacture  markup the only value you can get out of a jacket like this is to wear it a lot if you plan on doing so then its worth it if you dont its a waste    cont
  cont  4 leather sizing in particular is quite difficult to understand if this is your first jacket so ill try to make it clear and concise fashion jackets are to be as close fitting as possible and as  said it should be nearly impossible to zip up properly practical jackets are not like this if you want a leather jacket for riding then you absolutely need to get a jacket that you can zip up without losing your capacity to breathe leather doesnt stretch nearly as much as people think for example your sleeves wont get longer by an inch and things like this what happens with wear is that the leather tends to conform to your bodys proportions particularly where you bend elbows shoulders waist and this produces creases if you ride with a leather jacket after a year or so you find that parts of the jacket are looser than others and that creases form that may look unsightly if youre not on a bike and if the jacket is unzipped thats just what happens well worn leather jackets will look slightly oversized on a personand this is why with older jackets youll see people pairing it with a scarf a sweater and other things to fill out the gaps     5 not only do you have to find a manufacturer of the doublerider that fits your body better than others but you have to make a conscious decision about the type of leather being used for example horsehide is very durable and can take an excellent polish however it takes a long time to break in compared with other skins lambskin is on the opposite end its far more delicate and soft akin to a fabric but its less resistant to potential tearing lambskin is used in fashion clothing and in womens purses but its almost never seen on riding gear also you have to consider the drape of the jacket the firmer the skin the better it drapes for this style     cont
  cont    the reason is that there is a lot of heavy hardware belts buckles buttons zips that pull the jacket downward in weird places unless the lambskin version of this style is 100 new itll hang and be pulled in places that look awful which is why its usually best to go with cow/horse horse will be far more expensive but if youre only buying one and it looks awesome on you its worth it    6 schott focus ive tried on many jackets in this style and i finally had a chance to try on a schott two summers ago it was a severe disappointment for a few reasons a  mentioned the problem of the fit its a known problem with schott perfectos theyre made for the bulk of their clientele and like wested everything is generous in the stomach area now this is fine if youre riding but if you are buying the jacket purely for style then itll look awful b one thing that affected me in particular was that the examples i tried on simply didnt fit some things would work and others would be far out for example if the shoulders fit perfectly the stomach was too big if the stomach was perfect the length was too long there was always something fucked up about the jacket and i tried on 4 of them in different combos and styles i came to the unfortunate conclusion that a schott perfecto just wasnt for me granted all except one of my jackets were custom made to my size so my expectation of an offtherack schott was definitely influenced by this but considering that matchless belstaff and vanson fit me fine i was a little annoyed this is why its important to try them on in person and if youre not satisfied with the fit do not buy it schott is not the only good manufacturer of leather jackets theyre just the largest in usofa    cont
  that argument is stupid as fuck  most pieces of clothing out there have an original function and every one wears them beyond the original intent  do you call someone that wears jeans a poser  or everyone that wears a certain type of sneakers a poser  by your own standards everyone is a poser including punks punks wear jeans jeans werent created for punks so punks are posers  what a fucking stupid logic
7 the belt belted jackets can be difficult to size because youre deciding where your body will be cut in half this is yet another reason you have to try these jackets on in person before buying its a visual problem and the clearances have changed over the decades early 50s jackets tended to have the belt at or just below the navel compare that with today where trousers are low and thus trouser belts are low modern fashion doubleriders have mimicked this extension of the torso for better or worse so when you try one on you do have to zip and belt up the thing to be sure that when youre wearing it in a freak rain storm youre not going to look like youre wearing your fathers perfecto or that youre wearing one that is too short for you     8 sleeves in general if you ride a bike you need longer sleeves with this design unless the jacket has gussets the accordion looking extensions at the back of the shoulders then longer sleeves are necessary so that when you bend forward to grab the bars the jacket doesnt pull back to expose your wrists fashion jackets however do not take this into account they are cut so that it looks fine when youre standing up this explains a phenomenon that you may have already noticed that certain jackets for whatever reason have really long sleeves compared with the normal sizing once again take it into account if you want a riding jacket long sleeves are normal if you want a fashion jacket then dont bother with something like schott who tend to have longer sleeves    9 custom sizing many companies do this including schott this costs more but in the end its better for you in my view if youre spending money on a jacket that is meant to last you a lifetime aero vansen and others do custom sizing as well dont be afraid of custom sizing call the manufacturer and ask them if its possible tell them your size be honest false sizing just wastes money and see what happens    cont
cont    ive had nothing but good experiences with custom sizing and the one time i bought a jacket offtherack it turned out to be the one i wear the least because quite frankly it doesnt look as good as the others on me so if its your one and only jacket spend the money to make it right    bottom line try on as many as possible make sure you wear the clothes you plan to wear with the jacket ask manufacturers about custom sizing and how much it costs and consider seriously the type of hide its made of also be open to the possibility that the doublerider style may not be for you i have yet to find one that i like on my body so i simply havent bought one i may never but thats okay good luck      from what i know the other jackets from soul revolver are fine they are nearly all slimfit though so just be aware of this no beer bellies and if you plan on bulking up in the winter their jackets simply wont fit which one are you looking at also there are many companies that do this sort of thingdont be afraid to look at others
    yep its hit or miss with schott im 510 160lbs broad shoulders and some muscle no gut or anything and finally got lucky with a size 40 vintage early 90s durojac 518 for about 12000 usd on ebay the leather is in good condition but i had to make a few changes repairs etc this particular jacket fits me very well but it is a little short due to the nature of it being an actual riding jacket i had to get used to it and it made me realize how ill fitting modern trousers really are haha    sure there are things i would change i would make the arms slimmer make the length an inch longer but its as good as it gets on the cheap and like i said im not doing the slp thing anyhow im just a dirty old metalhead who likes leather and visits /fa/ too much
  vintage jackets tend to fit me better as well but for a doublerider i was very keen on getting something that i would make my own     something i didnt mention but is another fail for me with that design as a fashion design is that when its unzipped and unbuckled the belt just flies everywhere it hits desks smashes into chairs and knocks down valuable faberge eggs its stupidthe jacket is a style icon no doubt but if its used as solely a fashion jacket it just gets in the way not to mention that when its unzipped you have lots of fabric flowing around like wearing a doublebreasted suit jacket opentheres lots of material all going nowhere it doesnt look good in my opinion     you see this problem albeit in a smaller way with the b3 bombers which people wear nowadays in malls and other nonpiloting situations lots of buckles and paraphernalia swinging around getting caught on things then they wear sweatpants and sneakers with itgod    theres nothing wrong with being a metalhead liking leather or visiting /fa/ im a leather nut and my next jacket should be ready sometime this coming week however i think itll be my last for a whilei have all the styles that ive wanted to wear regularly so the rotation is now full my oldest jacket is almost a decade old now and its given me superb service a wested indy and i still wear it when im doing any outdoors stuff mostly gardening and repair/maintenance on the house and the other ones all get regular wear except my formal coats which i have to be a little more careful about

c/n this balmain leather
    yeah mine is for utility when it actually gets cold here in southern ca almost never the past 10 years and that damn buckle is always bashing something haha    btw i know you get shit here but your posts are always good and i enjoy reading them even though i dont share your taste in clothing
  thats very kind of you and i appreciate it anon i try to only comment on things that i know aboutif its something i dont know about like shoes i tend to shut up and listenlol as for getting shit on wellthese things happen i tend to find it hilarious because its not for any rational reason but i did kick the hornets nest a bitit was only after i bought the dmc jacket that i found out how polarizing the game was in terms of how they redesigned the main character for me it was just a fun jacket that had a hood that i wantedbut for others its an extension of the manifestation of all the things wrong with a favorite character of theirs and perhaps the gaming industry in general     clothing taste is always an interesting area to debate and what ive found is that it is far more heavily influenced by where a person lives than by anything else including their genetic predispositions ill never forget the first time i saw someone wearing a hawaiian shirtback in the day youd only see them on tv like on baywatch or whatever but when i saw one on a person irl i thought they must be mad it was wholly inappropriate for the location and climate and it looked like shit in retrospect it fitted him wellthe fit wasnt the problem the environment was    when we extend this outwards then its not only about the physical environment but also the social one too when i briefly lived in japan there were areas of the cities where you could really wear whatever the fuck you wantedyou were just a part of that crowd similarly if you live in berlin london or new york you can almost get away with anything and no one cares sure you might get mugged or knifed or acid thrown in your face but the point is that its not socially unacceptable to wear something different    this freedom isnt universal so im lucky right now
    hey man np i always appreciate the people on 4chan that a actually know wtf they are talking about and b produce posts that are interesting to read one of the best things about 4chan is the geographically and cuturally diverse amount of people you are able to interact with in a completely unfettered manner but it also means you have to ignore the trash and the crazy i remember that whole fiasco about the dmc jacket i simply found it fascinating on a number of levels     i love your commentary on clothing taste its funny how much conformity and social pressure there is concerning clothing i always appreciate somebody doing something different even if i personally find it goofy i guess thats just the artist in me we get used to taking risks and at times find ourselves so far outside of what is socially acceptable and the whole situation just seems silly i feel like this has changed a bunch in the past 20 years though the interconnectedness of our information society has had the effect of reducing the shock value of certain ideas / things but it has also reduced some of the magic     anyway i realize im rambling now
  it was a very odd situation thats for sure if i find any other fits that work with the jacket other than the ones i have now ill probably create a new thread with new pics just to see what happenslol but in my life the jacket has already passed into the passe situation with my social group nobody notices it nobody cares which is what i expected but i know it will not be a universal experience    you know what really cut it for me about clothing taste my uncle wears crazy shit i mean crazy shit for no reason to the point that if hes walking down the street you can instantly find him because no one would dress like this you know purple corduroy trousers or heeled boots even though hes well over 6 foot 3 hats of varying sizes and coloursessentially a white pimp all that being said hes well over 60 ive always wondered about it and finally i asked him one day trying to be polite how do you manage to wear things like this and not be selfconscious he replied with a laugh i wear it for myselfive spent enough of my life wearing clothing for others he worked in finance in an office building so he was always wearing suitsand perhaps there was social pressure to get the next cut the next watch the next shoesi understand that    but i wish id known that years ago for most of my life i wore things to make others notice me or look at me or think im attractive after i spoke with my uncle things started to change and i just started to wear things that i wanted to wear if i wasnt at work it started with all black because that was the easiest thingthen i started added colours and what i call randomness     im at the point now where my personality dominates what i wear in other words charisma counts the only thing that must be adhered to is the fit of clothes on your body beyond this go for what makes you happy
    awesome your uncle is a true alpha male specimen    im at the point now where my personality dominates what i wear in other words charisma counts the only thing that must be adhered to is the fit of clothes on your body beyond this go for what makes you happy    this make sure it fits make sure you personally like it and you are all good fuck the haters haha
  as a minor disclaimer though what i said does not in any way imply that planning coordination colour and texture schemes and shapes do not matter they absolutely matter its just that there comes a point where you begin to see people dressing similarly across the spectrum of groups in your society 20 y/o dress kinda the same35 y/o dress kinda the same fat beardies dress the same black heavy frame glasses with flannel shirts untucked and young financiers dress the same slim fit suitsalways then you begin to see that there are uniforms in society that we all wear just slightly different variations based on our knowledge and financial capability     when you see all this and how predictable it is eventually you just say fuckit im going to wear what is comfy or what i like again this doesnt mean you through fit out the window it just means that you start with a blank slate when you plan instead of starting with the standard uniform and slightly altering it to show your personality    but again you need to be in the right place in order for this to work going to church in a wifebeater is stupid playing at a tennis club in cargo shorts is stupid its always a combination of functionform and my own breakdown has function over form by quite a lot but thats just me      well he is in some respects he doesnt give a fuck what other people think and he loves to antagonize peoplelol we get along well
you will never achieve his success and taste in clothes
what are peoples thoughts on these types of jackets
  beyond shit imo
  all of them or just that one because its just an example i cant really rock black so i have to go with brown
                  
  why did you leave out the part where he was talking to himself
  astonishing ive never been labeled an autist before in my entire life i mean it certainly didnt happen when i made the first dmc thread im blown away by your originality such subtletysuchdepth i cant wait to read your screenplay      because i wasnt fool of a took       there are lots of problems with this jacket anon part of the reason it looks so poor is the stitching first the zippers are exposed which is in many ways a nono with good quality leather jackets the zippers are normally concealed especially the mains to prevent moisture/water from blowing in second the main zipper should be bidirectional as a single zipper is more prone to breaking at the waist unless you have a secondary attachment like a belt third the elbow stitching is useless why would you hae many separate panels at the elbow they dont provide more padding or reinforcement nor do they provide extra material for the bend theyre a poor design choice worthy of the pakistani companies that make these kinds of designs fourth this lack of purpose can be seen in the shoulder pieces which do nothing as well as the waist clinchers which clearly dont have enough material in between to actually accomplish anything finally the neck and cuffs are far too wide with the neck being particularly ugly     hopefully that was precise enough for you sorry but this jacket has many examples of design elements that are thrown into the leather jacket soup that you see coming out of pakistan one of the largest manufacturers of leather in general due to their lack of environmental laws on what chemicals you can dump into public waters after use i would avoid like grim death unless you want to look like a migrant
  yeah thats not the one im looking at i just mean the cafe racer style in brown leather thats a good point on the elbows i hate putting my elbow down on a seam im a little thicker than that guy so the neck would be more filled out i got a leather duffel bag from pakistan or somewhere over there and it fucking stunk i had to put it outside because it smelled so bad im not fucking with that shit anymore
please unsell me from buying a shearling jacket shearling jackets look so good
  gay
  shearling is cringe copout for actual layering and the trend ended 3 years ago
  cafe racers in general are always fine but there are differing opinions as to what direction you should go in terms of aesthetic i personally prefer either extremely simple like this        or something complex like this        what youll notice though is that when proper cafe racers get more complex in design its either because of colour schemes or because of specific addons that make riding more convenient expansions at the waist that work zipper pulls that allow for venting either in the front or rear of the jacket shoulder reinforcements and areas suited to include armor which you wear in case of collision that sort of thing    fashion jackets in the caferacer style mimic these things but dont apply them practically which means that if you go in that direction a discerning eye will notice the fakery with ease just be aware of thatits not a complete nono but it is something that i would avoid if you can spend the same money on something real      i cant mani always love the look the problem today is that weve gone through something of a shearling renaissance probably because of the recent wwii movies that came out that included characters flying you see it come in waves though in the 80s there were a lot of pilot movies so the aviator style became extremely popular once again then in the late 90s it died out and jackets got efficient in design again now shearling and b3s are back these things happen
is showing your socks /fa/ how are suits supposed to fit should the pants end this high up the leg

what glasses is he wearing at tokyo comic con i guess i dont need the exact brand/name but what can i look up to find similar ones im retarded sorry
  haha yeah its probably good for like eating and stuffyou knowplatonic things      i will try to find this out for you
  i will try to find this out for you    thank you3 and good luck
  it might take me a few days but check back because i am pretty curious too
god hes just so cute i want to kill myself  gnight /ezg/ until tomorrow
  lol wtf is that dracula cosplay
  gross
will art hoes still swoon for me if my fit is effay af but no instagram
  i drop every girl with instagram   not out of some stupid principal or some other fedora thingy but plainly because every girl i have ever met or dated that had an instagram turned out to be an personalitylet thot even if they looked modest and cute so i just dropped all girls that have insta because they arent worth the time
  yes
  im fucking 3 art hoes off tinder atm and i dont have an ig
  i get more pussy since i made an ig account but its not necessary
  thats a stupid thing to have as a deal breaker
  but thats pretty much most girls isnt it     also why are girls always such normies
how do you dress to attract art hoes all black converse obscure graphic tees
  literally tuck in your band shirt with jeans and doc martens
  doc martens     fuck i hate these clown shoes
  they look qt on grills tho
  lmao thats retarded youre pretty much cutting out 90 of middleclassorhigher society almost every girl has an instagram and thats just a moronic generalization to make
  literally fucking this know a few guys with arthoe gfs that fit your exact description  most broke up after a month or two
    t instagram having personalitylets  lets face it if you are that vain that you want everybody to see your little pretend life you put up on instagram you are not worth dating  i learned it the hard way    not where i live here in the netherlands only kechs and uni kechs have insta whihc are alright for fucking but not for relationships
  how do you do this dawg
  what about it makes you get more pussy
  i dress like a borderline fucking chav/scally but i live in the states so theres not a stigma associated with it its the exact opposite of what you would think to attract these kind of girls but somehow i manage with extreme success     it probably doesnt hurt that im typically 10years their senior not broke and still have all my hair either
i only use ig to follow stores or brands for sales or new drops i have honestly nothing interesting to post and every time i try to post something i feel like a try hard having an emptyish ig with 20 followers might as well be like not having one
  chav/scally  forgive me but whats that
   lots of sportswear/branded clothing i wear mostly pretty generic middle mall tier shit i cop at outlets desu nike hoodies and jackets tnf coats always nike air max running shoes primarily black or grey and i color coordinate the accent colors like a faggot but it works
how is this related to fashion 
why do people like this shit brand are these clothes supposed to be good
  because they are dumb nouveau riche with no taste
  its ostentatious without being gaudy  shows people youre rich without spending 240k for a solid gold shirt
  you obviously dont get it
more swag than u fag hahaha go back to r/mfa dorky ass
its supossed to look bad its le epic ironic fashion you wouldnt get it lmao
  this not even joking what is demna is biggest irl shitposter milking off normies money shit just shows anything will sell if it has badge on it
  the passport stuff is neat though
    even if youre rich isnt spending insane amounts of money on clothes from other designer brands just as dumb what makes vetements worse than any other high fashion brand i like clothes but at the end of the day fashion is pretty retarded economically
  it may be dumb but at least it can be justified by knowing youll look stylish vetements is just ugly
  its meta commentary to popular culture and fashion trends you either like the idea and appreciate the product represented by it or not
  is that fucking ice poseidon

  never reply to any thread ever again
  they look more like dontes boots less belts than dantes  different toe clearly its the guy who got the dmc coat just looking to complete the fit
  unless youre pairing them either with a full leatherfag or a murky disrockerlook im sorry
  are you a gay tanker
  yes the sooner you realize that the sooner you can truly enjoy this site
  fuck
  speak for yourself im here to have serious fashion discussions with anonymous underages are vans old skools /fa/ is pewdiepie /fa/ is smoking /fa/ ill start if it is how to dress to get gf like picrel saint laurent paris saint laurent paris saint laurent paris celine are broken mirrors /fa/
  
  thats acktcualluuytlllyu alright    most boots on this board are trash
  look like they give 5 to dex so good cop i guess
  based dex build
  where from
  unironically based
  not op but those are john varvatos
  you dont even need to dress or look good to get picrel tier gfs all you need is the money that sugar daddy look comes naturally
  severe lack of belts on these be sure to match the fit with belts on your legs torso arms and neck
so i visited stylezeitgeist    who is this faust guy he seems to be the main contributor with 36k posts from 2006 does he actually work in the fashion industry
  looks like some dyel faggotry  probably on the spectrum if u know whati mean
he is the creator of the site as well as the destroyer his elitist approach to moderation and basically excluding everyone but him and a few core members helped turn the board into an inbred little cult
  what is that coat  looks like the allsaints bodell coat
  could be ccp looks awkwardly stiff enough
nice sunglasses or no /fa/
  those are old school as fuck they would be good with dress clothes
are piercings /fa/
no
body modifications are the antithesis of effay
  /fa/ is pretty divided on this  generally you will get  self mutilation of ones body in any era  but some like it  do what you want  i have a nostril piercing a septum piercing and my ears pierced i wear a small silver ring both the same size in my nostril  septum though nostril is 18g septum is 16g and i currently have some small safety pins in my ears  if youre on the fence maybe buy a fake nose ring based on pic related to try it out  threadly reminder that most /fa/ users look like shit
did i mess up grenson
  should have gotten the boots instead those look strange
  i hope you are a massive fag because thats what people are going to assume you are when they see those shoes
  kek
  what are they supposed to be moc toe derby brogues
are you a literal child or a petite girl everything in that pic looks too small
  i think its like a city brouge or something
they look alright but your trousers are too tight   did you not get the memo about loose fit trousers
  did you not get the memo about loose fit trousers  thankfully not
  can you post your toes i need to see them so i can give you a real answer
    fucking retarded zoomers pic related are moc toes  ops are brogue derbies with wedge soles
  bad either way
  very sad
  these wouldnt look too bad with a wider pair of cropped pants but the pants you have on right now are too slim for such a chunky soled derby
  if youre planning to spend your time on your knees with a cock in your face then no you didnt mess up
  just the socks change them asap
is a front tuck /fa/ or should i go full tuck
  front tuck is for mexicans showing off their fake lous vutton belt  no tuck unless you are wearing a full suit or dadcore
dont tuck if your pants are low rise like op
  never front tuck  only untuck when wearing shorts  like  said dont buy low rise trousers  always fucking tuck in when wearing trousers dont listen to unfashionable hypebeast instagrammers who say otherwise untucking makes you look like a mfa soiboi who is afraid of having a style and besides that untucking completely fucks up your proportions
its called a french tuck it came from queer eye dont listen to these fuckin imbreads its cash if someone on this board says somthing is gay its probably the right option
  and its fucking shit only moroccans with fake gucci belts do it its absolute hypebeast shit for zoomers  hang yourself
alright you obviously dont know shit why are you even fuckin here go back to /b/ and kys french tuck is heat and rolling tucked all the time is obviously not an option half my shirts front tuck on their own after a while
  maybe you should buy shirts that fit lose weight and go to a tailor before the next time you think of wearing a shirt  they arent supposed to fall out idiot
im tall and skiny you fucking retard any shirt thats long enough for my torso is like a bag on me taylors are expenisve af so im mot going to taylor 25 shirts
    french tuck is retarded your queer eye idol looks like a tool with his fake silver hair and skinny fit everything youll realize all of this 5 yrs from now when youre on the tail end of the super baggy trend do yourself a favor and tuck in your shirt to straight fit pants youll thank yourself later
  depends on your proportions and your belt

how long did it take to get used to cocks in your ass
  how long does it take your body pillow to dry after weeping into it
  dont change the subject
  im not op so i wouldnt know  dont dodge the question
  its ez asf you lowkey crave it
at what point in life is it weird for a man to be effay by that i mean wearing clothes that some people might call bold for lack of a better word     im 20 and in the process of losing weight but i feel like i missed out on so many chances to dress in an aesthetic but alternative way because id look like a neckbeard
im 20 and im so old i cant dress how i want  you are so young still dude also i wouldnt really say theres an age where you cant dress how you want it has much more to with how you act by the time youre old
people just stop caring as much when youre older but you shouldnt be dressing up for other people anyways so do whatever
20is nothing you fag you still have 4 more solid years you could easily be hypebeast if you wanted granted i wouldnt advise a drastic shift in style any which way give youre no longer a teen but seriously plenty of time to be a e s t h e t i c
give it a shot  your confidence should be growing anyways  express yourself anon try it out
  no such thing you can always find something dramatic to wear that is age appropriate i agree with the other posters 20 is still young even at 30 and 40 you can find bold items from labels like lanvin or engineered garments that suit an older man
  let me edit what you said    of course we dress for other people we dress because that is how other people see us    i dress different because i want to weed out the normies the friends i keep better not be normies and i signal that with my choice of clothes
  what do you normally wear out of curiosity or whats your style like
  only black jeans slim or skinny lots of dark colors some cream some blue denim tops dark green some tight fitting tshirts some oversized longsleeve crews no graphic ts    long hair circle rimless glasses ginger hair
  based sounds cool now op needs to tell us what he wears
  relatively nondescript clothing lots of flannel and plaid i also like sweaters sweatshirts track jackets     jeans will be blue normal fit/bagginess if not a little long b/c my waist is to big for my height i might also wear some addidas track pants with the right outfit     pic related is a good example    at risk of sounding autistic the goal is an asian exchange student look because i have fine hair and a defined but not very square/angular jawline like many asian exchange students i see and a lot of them look great
  this is an extremely normal outfit are you sure you like fashion
  depends on your city what you are able to pull off etc just develop your own wardrobe its never too late
  i am but currently i dont have the skinny/muscular physique for anything fashionable so it seems like a waste of money to buy effay clothes when my fat physique will ruin them however i am losing weight and will hopefully be ready soon     thats why i asked my question i was wondering how much time i really have
  you have until youre a corpse style and age arent very correlated
  thank you anon
  this you should never dress to impress other people your personal style should be an extension of who you are and what you like its the ultimate pleb filter youll only attract the people you want to
  what literally never the older you get the more normal it is
  at no point do you realize how hard it is to truly become effay with it all being totally internalized and authentic    you see effay movie stars singers celebs they are only effay because people who make a living on their knowledge of how to simply look effay dress them up and basically create cheat codes for these people    you can tell when one of these people celebs slips through the cracks and starts dressing themselves they end looknig just as bad any other uneffay person just with more money to do it with which somewhat mitigates the lack of effayness    to be truly effay it involves tons of hard work and an artistic appreciation and an understanding of your place in society it involves tons of experiementation and failures along with the odd lucky success its like anything else    no one is naturally effay it is something you have to develop over many years there are ways to cheat code it such as first dont be fat simply not being fat is very important not being fat also naturally makes you want to dress extra well its a snowball effect but just having the desire to dress well is simply a desire dressing well is a meme dressing in a highly unique and successful way is personal

are hawaiian shirts effay
  its basic bitch whte boi tier
  yes
  not if you are soi and wear it like they do also be white and attractive
deffo
  in 2014/16 yeah
are they effay
only if they represent a vow you intend to keep
no theyre a basic bottom bitchs way to act daring
i wear one silver ring with a black stone because it looks nice i plan to get another bigger one with a huge deep red stone but my shitty fingers are too skinny at the moment rings are effay but only 13 in my opinion
no theyre not anyone who tells you otherwise almost certainly wears rings themselves and is trying to justify their own actions  a wedding band is /fa/ however
rings are tacky no matter what    marrying ever  demiurge worshiping scum
why are so many niggers and spics wearing this brand all of a sudden

what is the most /fa/ eye color/hair color/hair type/skin color and why is it brown/black/curly/olive
youre right but for the hair hair texture doesnt matter because /godtier/ is a buzz cut  bonus points for an effay beard
its not
  buzz cut is a meme  very few people can pull it out
brown eyes
  cope shitforeyes
david
brown eyes    yeah no its the most basic bitch soulless eye color a human being can have
  light hazel eyes the kinds that look like pools of honey are the most effay followed by green then blue then waaaay at the bottom is dark brown like the ones in op pic those are just shit tier
daily reminder
  theres a girl in one of my classes who has eyes that color and it feels like she has no soul
imagine sharing the same soulless color with billions of chinks indians africans and 85 of the world in general
  true is fucking sad having brown eyes becacause all my expressions look soulles
green/brown/wavy/pale  as a fellow brown eyed fag i must say it seems that you are coping there is nothing effay about brown eyes as they are the least rare and dont look like anything i dont think they look bad per say but they definitely dont look good theyre so average that calling them effay is practically insulting
black hair very dark brown eyes and tanned skin     or white/pale skin with brown/blonde hair and coloured eyes

  a good personality  99 of women are stuck up especially white women
  appearing to be stuck up or a bitch can be a defense mechanism some women develop due to constantly being hit on by men
  hey if they dont want to be hit on they shouldnt spend time making themselves look good
  well they still want to attract the best mate they can no way to attract only the best guys though unfortunately so being a bit unapproachable is a defense against that
  depends on the girl if she has a nice butt then jeans/shorts should be worn to show it off otherwise im a fan of dresses that show off
no contest
thigh highs high heels skirt
  this     came here to describe this exact kinda outfit and this anon posted a gif instead

  yes
  this but with flats
  holey moley  i dig it yo digits
    awful personality  constantly being hiton  attract best men    alternate theory women actively make themselves uglier to reduce the amount of men hitting on them because the stress of picking one guy out of hundreds of okay dudes feels worse to them than if they only had the choice of a single ugly dude  theres no tyranny of choice problem if they eliminate suitors wherever possible
i mean think about it how could a girl possibly be looking for the best man she can get if she actively  makes herself obese  gets a million tattoos  gets an ugly haircut in a garish colour  tells whoever will listen that she is an intersectional feminist  never smiles and isnt nice nor kind to anyone    it cant be that the best man for them is some guy that excuses or likes all of these things because the only men that will accept all of these things is an objectively shit man  if it was just a few tattoos then maybe you could say they were trying to attract a musician or a biker type guy but theres a legion of girls out there that are over the top ugly
naked there is no particular kind of clothing that will turn me on anymore than others
a cute knit hat scarf a fur coat some tight jeans tall suade boots winter makes me wanna gf
    synthesis of these full mens yohji
tight jeans especially light blue jeans and a pastel coloured tight top
  overall a comfy t shirt no bra pajamas or short athletic shorts    realistically in public black wool/cloth jacket scarf black/grey denim shorts bonus points if distressed with black leggings and cute flats final extra bonus points for a hair accessory like a bow or flower shed be a pale caucasian with brunette hair and a petite build her locks would be up in a high ponytail with bangs and longer strands of hair falling to the sides    oneitis sucks
  it goes away eventually
  subconsciously trying to exploit the basic principle that people want what they cant have    unfortunately if there is subconscious understanding that they could indeed be had if you were willing to overlook a multitude of things that disgust you the whole facade becomes evident and just looks disgusting and ridiculous with a degree of humor
  thank god my oneitis is cured better to understand that ill be alone forever and not worry about such unreasonable things
thigh highs  short shorts/skirt  comfy  sweater  making the big penis  tight low cut shirt

  they think that by making themselves unavailable they make guys want them because people want what they cant have it fails because the things they do to make themselves unavailable are negative not positive making yourself a fat tatted freak is gross as opposed to being unavailable because shes just way too attractive for example

you see my problem
  is that i enjoy
  looking at and collecting
  womens inspo far more
  than mens fashion inspo
  which would be ideal
  wwhat video
  were i a women
  but im a man
  therefore im very aware
  fuck
  of what looks hot
  on women even though
  i cant dress myself
    i guess women shouldnt have child bearing hips either
  fpbp
  you just posted attractive women their clothes are basic sexually provocative stuff and contribute little to their appeal
  not really man for all but maybe one or two you can cover their faces and even shrink the titties/thighs and its just as hot all they need to be is at least mildly in shape  pic related
  exact origin of my zr fetish and like heroin nothing comes close to the first one
    this was it for me 16 year old alizee performing in that outfit does it get any better
  hip bone structures are fine just fat distribution is the main issue
  this kid drives me fucking nuts god i hate myself
    oh yes mayby even with overalls minus the heels ofc those look just stupid in that set
  i only experience women through hollywood tropes the post
                      this qualifies as womens inspo  the absolute state of /fa/
  overwhelming majority of girls in that pic will need csections to give birth because their hips are way to small theyre practically 7 year old boys with vaginas thats just wrong and not as nature intended

  based redblooded male poster right here    low test /fa/ggots seem to prefer actual boybodied females over grown women with childbearing hips and plump asses  big tits so indicative of this boards traffic desu
  i second that
  imagine being this pathetic that you must prove your superiority on the internet while defending a trap
  needing that when inmortality is close
  saying anon is a dumb fag because lmao trap is what 27 year old virgins think is funny  proving my superiority  consider suicide my friend
my room has no personality it looks like a prison cell and i feel like its subconciously depressing me     how can i decorate my room in a tasteful way any creative ideas from you /fa/
tapestries   flags  maps  paintings  photographs  calendar    just some simple ones
plants
get rid of that black paint paint it white or off white even gray
  its actaully dark grey/bluish i like it i just need something to put on it
  white posters red string lights
  why is your door sideways
  im really fat and short
  kek
frame some artwork that you like etsy is a good place to buy cheap art files to print later i especially like hanging up album art in a gallery wall type of display you can even colorcode it all eg all black and white same color accents  put down a rug ikea and urban outfitters have a lot for cheap you can also get an inexpensive sheepskin  get some plants and open your blinds to let sun in for them  the picture doesnt show your bed but dress and make it if that isnt done already put down some throw blankets and throw pillows  collect some knickknacks you like to make it look lived in  get some candles and/or room spray to make everything smell nice  hope this helps
  lmao    idk how much light you get in your room but you should pick out some plants that match that amount of light you have big windows but without windowsill it seems put some tall growing plants on the floor so they receive enough light
because of my building being a repurposed office building i have this for a ceiling have fun trying to make that cozy
  shop for some posters the good kind of posters not the pulp fiction taxi driver ones i have pic related  frame those posters  get a calendar  if you are going for an artsy vibe get some christmas lights i hate how they look but you might like them
  how 2 artsy vibe
  get some shelves and put some cacti on them a toy car or some shit like that a zippo and a pack of camels a big thick book peferably about philosophy brothers karamazov is a good one and you should definitely read it if you can helps too  if you play any instrument you should leave it laying around when people come to your room but keep it safe if you have to  blacklights  led christmas lights
  go to your local art academy and buy paintings from art students
  first off open up your shades and get some light up in that bitch     next youre going to need to fill some of that empty space it doesnt take an interior decorator to pick out a few posters you like that generally match a theme then put them in a frame and hang them on the wall     literally just fill up the empty space with shit you like
some shelves maybe books little souvenirs or mementos even pinecones or seashells will do some resistant plants and also put stuff on tables and shelves dont just store everything in boxes and wardrobes
  something like this
  rugs hung on a wall look pretty cool sometimes and improve acoustics
  thats kinda cool to be honest in a strange way do you mind posting a full picture of your room im just curious
      collegetier decore advice that will leave your room looking like a frat boys            interior design advice    to understand tasteful decor you must know the signs of tasteless decor  no stupid band posters no pinups no christmas lights  go with things like rugs plants paintings good furniture etc  find some classy inspo and try to replicate it
  this right here op
  the equivalent of dadcore  good advice
  im sorry your funko pop collection and movie posters make your room look childish
  implying  real talk i dont get why people buy funko pops theyre literally the same model with different colors and hair thats it
  you can say that about any collectors items its a form of gambling that preys on people with the type of brain that is compulsive about that stuff people do the same with starbucks mugs from each state or those little spoons that all gift shops carry i think we just notice the funkopops more because of how inherently ugly and le nerdy xd they are hilarious because i think most people that collect would scoff at boomers for collecting those porcelain baby figurines     its the 2000s version of all the shit on the home shopping network
  nerd culture was a mistake
do any of you know where could i buy cheap tatamis for my room 
  why did i fail why did he succeed
go back
  lmao holy fuck hes actually triggered    lol    back to rddit    pfft
  you can only browse one retarded website at once  4channel and rddit arent almost exactly identical anyway
  this we hate you cuks
you have to go black
  theyre not reddit is a hugbox that silences dissenters while 4chan is unabashedly invidualistic and honest
  no the fuck it isnt todays 4chan is literally just an army of hivemind idiots who get pissed off at anyone who isnt on the side of the collective
  sounds like youre just salty that we make fun of your stupid raws and red wings
  sauce i want that azz
  wasnt everlane that shit show of a viral marketing scheme on here like 4 years ago
  you just dont know how to read between the lines and see trought the sarcasm and cynics plus its gotten worse since the plebbit cross posters flooded
    4chan is definitely more honest but this website has turned into a fucking joke
  same i need the sauce dude
    redidt and 4chan is literally the same now
  this
  i remember that got 3 shirts for free referring myself
  its easier to find quallity discussion on reddit but 4chan is funnier  its harder to enter the discusiion on reddit due to the way posts and replies are formatted and the votes also reddit is full of fucking retard basedcucks who reply to everything with shitty references    reddit is annoying and 4chan is pretty fun if you can find a board that interests you
  that brapper makes my pee pee become the slightly bigger pee pee
  damn imagine exploiting your workers out of 12435 a pair
i rrfuse to believe that 4channel has gotten to the point where we just link to plebbit threads
  youre a retard
        nobody wants you here please leave if you think 4chan has degraded which it has /b/ is porn now /pol/ is heavily shilled /mlp/ cant contain themselves then go to 8chn or a comfy forum dedicated to your interest if these arent good enough you care too much about karma circlejerking
  have a nice day friend
  yeah     too bad everlane is shit that shirt was thinking as fuck and worth less than the effort expended

why cant /fa/ accept that these are the most basic bitch male/female shoes of all time
  because adidas stan smiths exist
  because common projects achilles low exist
  these arent basic bitch theyre reddit normies dont know what common projects is
  because vibram kso evo toe shoes exist
  because adidas superstars and chuck taylors exist
  imagine thinking cps arent pure normiewear  yikes
  i think its because they all own them and this really hurts there feefees
  ive ever seen maybe 10 people use cps irl i live in eu are they really that much more popular in na
  nah i own two pairs and fully admit they are basic bitch
  i live in new york a lot of streetwear and mfashitters wear them over here
  sdgfs
  popular  basic
  yes it does
  i live in ny and i wear them i dont normally see others that do though ive been wearing them before reddit existed
  yes but they still look good and are easy to wear
  it kinda does tho
  nothing wrong with owning a pair of normie shoes these are the superior basic bitch vans though
  it does basic  bad though
  those only work in the summer the old skool are good for every season
  uncomfortable clogs i have no idea how people wear them
  i wear authentics year round never really thought them as a seasonal shoe desu
  well maybe it doesnt get too cold or snowy/rainy where you live around here wearing anything other than boots and high raise sneakers in the winter/fall makes you want to kys
  imagine avoiding certain clothes and shoes just so you dont look like a normie lmao fucking pathetic
please tell me how i could improve my style im un ironically going for a soundcloud rapper ascthetic as i feel it best suits me
bump

1 outfit rate  2 what style/color of shoes would go well with this
3/10  coat is kind of cool but i dont love the color  shirt is bad  jeans are bad  sneakers might work i guess

tbdesu i wish this would go mainstream so i could wear it without getting strange looks
  is this the new saw film
does he have good style or is he just really good looking
  he dresses and does his hair in accordance with his build and face and as a result he has both good style and good looks
  a little bit of both i dont care for the red shirt he has had some truly awful outfits here and there but he has his own style that is done well sometimes i dont think he is particularly good looking relative to other celebrities or models
  tips on such
  ya the red shirt is pretty bad this was just a random picture from my shia folder
  fucking leglet
  this was just a random picture from my shia folder  your what
  desu hes only 59 which in all reality probably means hes like 58 or 57 so hes a manlet in general
  hes better looking and more in shape than 80 of people and his fits are that of stalone in first blood always a transient
  isnt he a manlet    i like his fits but his appearance isnt impressive at all
  you need his physique or you arent going to pull this off
  hes 6ft at least
  he doesnt have a shia folder  pffffahahahahahaha
fitting clothes not too tight or too loose  clean haircut  decently build not skinnyfat  extra points for boots over generic sneakers    you can nitpick his color choice but if youre build have a nice haircut and wear fitting clothes youre going to do alright
  hes 100 5759    ya that reply shocked me i thought it was a given everyone here had one     most of his fits could be pulled off by someone skinny fat who is good looking though he normally layers up or wears a crewneck at the least in even hotter weather
this is now a jonah hill fit appreciation thread
  lmaooooo gtf outta 4chan shia
slim fit
shia threads just reinforced the fact that /fa/ is a bunch of tasteless retards he looks like shit and if he wasnt ritch and famous he would get laughed out of the waywt
  coming to fa when you think its shit board     why then
  is shia actually good looking  man sometimes i think maybe im not that hot after all and then i hear people call shia gosling ect ultra atractive and i start to feel alot better about myself    all these ezra threads that are going on tho now that guy makes me feel like an uggo
  thats what the thread is about you fucking spaz its about deciding if its his style like so many imply or that hes just fit and good looking
his celebcreative status boosts his 6/10 looks and fits to 9/10 among high schoolers and young 20 something wastemen who dont know how to wear shit besides mallcore garbage
based
  fuck off jonah
he has very good fits
  are nike cortez fa 
i like the boots
ive given up on my masculinity    lets get a trap/femboi inspo thread going you /fa/gs    pic unrelated
  reiko got your doxx loooool
im looking for something to keep me warm now that winter is upon us its going to get cold here in scandinavia so im hoping that you can help me and any other in this thread looking for the same thing to find a long black coat  thats what ive settled on i want a long black coat the thing is no black coats i find are long enough its always just above the knees id prefer something that reaches just under my knee or like pic related very dark grey or very dark teal is okay as well
idk what your thrift situation is like in scandinavia but ive found the best coats by looking through the womens section at goodwill  im wearing a heavy jil sander one today that goes almost to my ankles and the only way youd know its womens is by the button stance    if you want something more edgy like in your pic do a grailed search for devoa individual sentiments the viridianne or forme dexpression
  thanks ill try checking out some thrift shops but have anxiety so maybe ill sperg out in the store  not really looking for pic related needs to be warmer
  acne studios chad
coat in that pic doesnt look very warm
  this is pretty nice made in korea w/ 85 wool 15 cashmere but its not the warmest jacket for nordic winter also like 900    that being said ill try to cop one if they go on sale after xmas
det finnes ikke dårlig klær bare dårlig vær      enjoy freezing to death in a good looking coat  srsy you cant wear anything that mostly looks good when its worn open and expect not to freeze to death    unless    you have a termovest underneath that you can close and wear wool long johns but still enjoy freezing while im chilling in my puffer jacket
  i have two and theyre fucking freezing both of them
this one you might actually survive in and it ven looks good closed too bad its from japan and     
thoughts
  
do you know anything about this brand i thrifted a long black wool coat but i dont know wtf it is

  cheap black thrift shit milsurp  go next
do you want her name or do you want fashion advice
her name sorry if i wasnt clear
not knowing rss name
fuckin luv these threads
the sad thing about /dwc/ is that is has a good aesthetic behind it which im sure a lot of posters understand but finding worthy material / fits is so hard the threads often devolve into post cool obscure looking images
  understand    stop being such a tryhard fag its literally just what  said    fbpb
this is now a /dwc/ thread  post inspo or gtfo
  she popped up in a bunch of deepweb threads for a short while no idea where the pics came from but therrs an anon here with at least 20 different photos of anyones got them feel free to dump       that jacket was a mall tier obey peice circa 2001 iirc tons of people had that jacket in the earlymid 200s       dwc is largley a photographic aesthetic now that can be said for many styles but its particularly true for dwc many of the pics posted in here are just indo pick and pull from where you like and make a fit of your own not unlike runway shows they serve as inspiration for a look but arent intended to be a copy/pasted look in itself
  w2c
these threads were cool until people came through with 90s/00s leet hax0r core and boring crack whores neck yourselves
  ive never seen this ozweego colorway before that looks dope as fuck
  these threads were cool  no they were always shit they started as some anons inspo pinterest board/tumblr collection of anything edgy with 0 zero not a single one actual fits and have been the same for the past months this is not a style its a loose collection of cursed images some dudes wearing black and two anons talking about something something antisocial
how about a /dwc/ thread where the same boring pictures of people wearing expensive clothes dont get posted over and over literally nothing about a pair of 400 dollar sneakers says deep web and neither does teenagers larping and pretending theyre not like the other guys
powerpoint slides corrupted on me
does anyone have inspo on the anti cctv and camera flash reflective gear

previous thread     bbc perfume documentary part 1 of 3      w2c bottles  usacanada          use google to obtain the maximum discount code at fragrancenet 37    europe    see directory at bottom for your country    general info        various fragrance communities/review sites/blogs                w2c samples              on diy fragrances  
dracdoc mentions how he wears ahs in the winter  ive tried it on skin today and it projects and lasts well also like the fresh orange and sea smell kinda like vph  im considering getting a bottle but if i do land this job at a cafe its policy to not wear frags so im just wondering if its worth getting just for days out or trips to the beach and stuff
i want to breathe dhi instead of oxygen
  i want to breathe dhi i want all food to taste like the smell of noir extreme i want to shower in tuscan leather
anyone have a bigger picture of the fragrance group picture above
ck obsessed intense experiences anyone
  a sample set and a gift card peoples tastes are very fickle and the worst thing is having to keep and wear a bottle you hate out of politeness which is what youre rolling the dice on
  thats the original size just enlarge it in paint for something
just got a bottle of pic related quirky little scent reminds me of camping out in a tent curled up in a sleeping bag plasticky tarp synthetic fabrics sweat mosquito repellent vague smell of the pines outside    well see how it holds up on a proper day out does this thing not even come with a cap fucking lazy devs
  click on the picture its just the thumbnail thats small
recommend me some snice perfumes
  ive heard that roja is pretty snice
what fragrance would they wear
  why do i see tbis image poted everywhere is it the same guy posting the pic or do people on /fa/ really think hes effay
  its the same guy    they wouldnt wear any fragrance is decadent
  mosley would wear penhaglion sartorial or something like that hes a baronet after all
just ordered a couple imaginary authors samples a city on fire and cape heartache can share thoughts when i get them but it may be weeks to get up here to canada
  i have roja enigma elysium parfum and amore mio they are indeed snice
cant decide between a frag for summer stuck between versace eau fraiche and dior homme eau for men     pls help also if theres any other good recs
  i love eau for men but ive not tried eau fraiche to compare some say dhe is similar to prada lhomme but i feel like the cedar in eau is dominant enough that it completely changes it    ive heard good things about the bvlgari aqva line but cant comment
  very snice do random women also compliment you on plane flights for wearing it
  nice rn its on sale so id be saving like 40 on eau for men    also think the iris would make it stand out a lot from the usual frags worn here
  cant say ive had that happen specifically no but ive definitely had women tell me i smell snice while wearing them    in my opinion though not all roja frags smell that snice he goes a little heavy with the oud cumin and animalic notes sometimes and those frags wind up smelling pretty skanky different strokes i guess
  i think its a fragrance that should be more talked about than it is i know its different for everybody but i get amazing performance from it too probably better longevity than i do with dhi
          youre all autistic she wrote smile not snice ffs
  pointing out the obvious  calling others autistic
  bump
can you recommend me something i might like    ive tested givenchy gentlemen only intense zadig and voltaire this is him and gucci guilty absolute    i loved those scents but their performance was very bad
  it very clearly says snice m8
im trying some summery frags out on skin tomorrow when im in town  id like one for dates was leaning towards dhc or even light blue
went to a chanel store and tried out most of the stuff a few weeks ago ended getting a bottle of bdc parfum and was given a decant of platinum egoiste which i soon learned that i couldnt live without    3 weeks later and i ordered a bottle of it off fragrancex but the top notes are noticeable less sharp/metallic than the sample decant id describe it as being more diluted the drydown and everything else is exactly the same so what gives
whats your goto scent gonna be this holiday season /fg/ just picked this up recently smooth spicy warm and sweet but thankfully not too sweet gf goes nuts over it i think it suits christmas time very well
  really i got 12 hours gga i love the brown leather dry down
  bentley for men intense and azzaro wanted by night parfums de marly herod or tom ford oud wood on special occasions
thoughts on mr burberry edt people absolutely shit on this in the community but a guy at my work started wearing and it smells really nice on him is shitting on it a meme
do you think its worth spending lots on citrusy summer fragrances    i love things like neroli portofino mandarino di amalfi and other similar things but when they have such poor longevity is there any need to spend that much when youll get similar performance from versace pour homme
  probably my ysl tuxedo super high on that stuff right now such a snice smooth patchouli scent sweet but not too sweet and great performance    might go fucking fabulous some days too
  its just nothing extraordinary a generic npc frag
  depends generally id say no since as you said longevity with those sorts of scents is usually not great there are some niche citrusy summer scents that perform well though roja elysium parfum gives me like 1012 hours consistently and smells kind of like a mix of bdc and cedrat boise but better
  that when i get it ill throw in some oud wood tv dhi and a bit of noir extreme too though
  snice  can we end this i see nothing funny here that my smile got complimented stay bitter virgins
  we may dont smell as snice as you but theres no reason to call us bitter virgins anon 
  thats not very snice
    get a life
where do people buy fragrances in canada everything is so much more expensive online and retail it might actually be cheaper to buy from the us with the currency difference and pay for shipping than buy it here
  its just a bit of fun m8 relax you seem kinda insecure maybe your smile isnt so snice after all
  fragrancebuy m8
  i usually buy from fragrancebuyca or fragrancexcom whichever has the cheaper listed prcie in cad fragrancex actually ships cheaper to canada than does fragrancebuy which is in canada so thers that to consider
  there are fresh citrusy scents that have decent performance but its not common weirdly one of the best for performance and longevity ive encountered was a aventus clone called laventure
im thinking of getting aventus and royal oud this weekend good idea
i bought versace dylan blue did i fuck up
  virgins    has had sex with a bunch of prostitutes so your argument is invalid
  its not anything new but it is nice i cant deny that i dont agree with the carboncopy comments everybody makes of it theres something in the drydown that gives it a bit of a dated edge that i really like could be the vetiver makes it smell formal i guess you could say i wouldnt buy it but i did like it on my dad
  im not that big on aventus personally id say pv is a better buy overall royal oud is very snice though probably creeds most underrated scent id definitely grab that one
  gucci guilty absolute  azzaro wanted by night  azzaro pour homme intense  1 million prive  armani stronger with you  gonna be drowning in puss this winter desu
  azzaro wanted by night  armani stronger with you  holy fucking based
  is this a meme post
  nope i really will be rocking those this season and fucking your girlfriend while wearing them too
  pfffft good luck fucking someone who doesnt exist
  well shit

i like to wear prada lhomme on my neck and then a spray of terre dhermes on my right wrist this is my daytime/office setup here in the scandinavian fall is this a stupid combination what other good combos can you recommend gonna try switching the tdh for a more woody one thinking tom ford oud wood or something else with lots of oud ideas suggestions     whats the best oud frag for the fall/winter
who here gettin that good snice this weekend and what scent are you wearing for it
  aramis havana
  the idonthaveanoriginalthoughtsoillpostmuhjeremyagain starter pack

  haha cool im just teasing my first frag was burberry weekend i bought at the airport on some trip but after using that one up i went to hms shitty 8/bottle frags
are these gift sets worth the money      
  i smelled all of them they have them in montreal at a boutique called etiket memoirs of a trespasser and falling into the sea are probably their best offerings a city on fire was fine too hated cape heartache
  gonna alternate between spicebomb extreme and 1 million privé fuck those are good
  shit im gonna do it gonna buy one of these i can go test everything out at my local perfumery but what do you guys think  tf jasmin rouge  tf neroli portofino  tf tuscan leather  tf tobacco vanille   tf noir de noir  tf oud wood    vs     am gold  am dia  am ciel  am reflection  am jubilation 25  am beloved    they both come out to pretty much the same price/ml
    didnt mean to be rude but i honestly find that fragrance to smell rancid and i have confirmed this with others as well tobacco oud and oud wood are much better options in that same line
    1 million privé was the other option i was leaning towards when i bought spicebomb extreme and i also thought it was excellent even smoother and a little more wearable than spicebomb
  no its pretty common
  youre gonna get so sick of it i loved it at first but now i hate it it smells like chlorine pool water to me now
  havana is actually very good in its class no need to be ironic
  fucking amazing digits
welcome to /litfrag/ post what you are wearing and reading now
  no pic but im doing  prousts a la recherche  terre dhermes  feeling pretty french desu
  patrician taste
  very snice choices  encre noire  mary beard spqr
  1mil prive is easily one of the best fall/winter frags ive ever smelled people shit on pr but prive is the best theyll ever release
  i hate 1 million invictus 1 million lucky pretty much any scent from pr really but i have to say privé is actually legitimately pretty snice
  i love the scent but i grow sick of it after 5 mins when i wear it its wayyyyyy too goddamn sweet to smell all day
  id say the tom ford it contains all the greatest hits like tl tv and ow whilst the amouage is missing a few like interlude memoir and epic
  how do you like the encre noire i was going to get it as my cheap everyday choice how pungent is the smell could you notice it from more than a couple feet away    roman history book    are you literally me
  leaning towards the tf yeah but what do i do with the jasmin rouge thats a female frag
  really personally the whole reason i like privé compared to other pr scents is because i find the sweetness to be much more restrained everyone perceives this stuff differently i guess scent is interesting like that
  kek was gonna post this
  witnessed holy shit
  its great but you wont probably get compliments for it and the projection is moderate id say around 3 feets max which is not a bad thing since i wear it for myself
  240 euros for this gift set do i do it what else could i do with that money in terms of frags
  i mean you could buy a full bottle of tom ford or amouage for that probably a better use of your money since there are bound to be a few scents in each set you dont like and probably at least one youll really like and want to buy a full bottle of    id just buy a set of samples of tom ford and amouage maybe even just go to a store and try a bunch for free then buy a full bottle of whatever you think is snicest
  whoah white and based
is there a booklet with those scented cards or magazine 1ml sample scents that you can buy/get somewhere i know you can get samples from stores but i want a bunch of samples like 2030 kind of like the paint/fabric sample booklets
  those cards arent really very good because you really need to smell the scent on your skin to know how itll smell on you there are sites that sell sample packs maybe look into that
  with my autism and insecurity i wont be able to just get 4 or 5 test scents and make a decision
  some testers go for 1/ml theyre not that expensive unless you do big name brands
  is there a store/site that lets you pick and choose which scents you want to test with the tiny samples i have no problem paying that plus shipping i just dont want to pay like 10 for a tiny vial of a scent i dont like at all or cant see myself buying
  read the op you retard
  if you like it wear it fuck gender in fragrances man or give it as a little stocking filler to a female relative or partner
  i did and it doesnt provide me with what i had in mind i dont think what im looking for is even available
  even the bit that says where to cop samples and proceeds to give you links
  w2c samples            it should be criminal to be this retarded
      samples of colognes that i know i do not want to buy  the perfumedcourt is the closest thing but those only give you so many options    im talking about picking literally any 10 or 15 samples from designer fragrances for whatever 2 or 3 dollars a ml plus shipping not collections not prepicks
recommend me your non pajeet tier fragrances
  that option is literally in the fucking links ive done it myself
  what the fuck do you mean they only give you so many options search for the fragrance you want click on it click the size you want and click add to cart search for another one you want rinse and repeat until you have picked literally any 10 or 15 samples from designer fragrances please dont reproduce
whats a good perfume i could get my mum for christmas i havent got a fuckin clue
  some samples and a gift card i already posted earlier in the thread why getting a bottle is a bad idea
welp my order of like 20 samples from the perfumedcourt came in today first one i tested literally 2 minutes ago was baccarat rogue 540 edp and im in heaven fuck this smells sooo fucking good /frag/
  mugler cologne if you insist on buying one and want something safe its cheap and smells like citrusy soap
    fucking based
    its amazing literally lasts for days dont know why its not talked about much here
  ask her what perfume she likes youve still got a long time til christmas that she wont associate your question with christmas
guys my cdg amazing green runs empty    are there similar green and fresh scents around to try instead  i need some diversity
  thanks whats pv or do you mean ov original vetiver
  pineapple vintage
  pineapple vintage google it the site parfums vintage makes very highquality aventus clones and they have a bunch of different versions so you can consistently get a fruitier batch smokier batch etc    best bet if you dont know which to get is pineapple vintage intense its pretty balanced and about 98 the same as aventus for much less money
  serpentine
    thanks sadly im not in america so thats going to be pretty pricy for something i may not like
anyone tried loccitane frags before what are your thoughts on it
what are your favourite floral frags for men /frag/
      ive got both prada lhomme and dhe and i personally prefer prada iris in dhe feels somewhat out of place and forced comparing to dh and dhi in a very bleu de chanel like opening it also dissipates quite fast on other hand prada is something else i did hear it was similar to dhe but having tried it myself i wouldnt necessarily say that with all that said dhe remains an iris frag with a weak iris note meanwhile prada is a i am feeling so freshfrag where iris is one of the notes but it blended extremely well
  yeah i agree lhomme is as close to perfect as a fragrance can be for me its linear but it knows what it wants to be and it does it well
i want fragrances in japan but im far too poor for issey miyake any advice
  old spice original carnation  carnal flower tuberose  rose 31 rose  honour man geranium  invasion barbare lavender  safran troublant saffron  dhi iris  cuir de russie carnation iris ylangylang  portrait of a lady rose  this one is marketed as feminine but look at the other notes very wearable for men
  eau des baux is my favorite fragrance of all time did not care for their loccitane and cade      i enjoy tuberose flash by tauerville tf got me interested in tuberose fragrances but i cant find any good frugal ones
  i can t think of anything cheaper than issey its like 23 on fragrancenet comme des garcons and yohji come to mind but they are way more expensive
favourite high heat fragrance    mine has always been versace pour homme but i want something different next year any suggestions
  oh the only battles i saw inperson were like 180
  eau radieuse
currently wearing paco rabanne pour homme at work im getting looks from every 40 woman who walks up to my register they know that i know
  1973    shit no wonder thats the smell of their youth right there
is anybody using valentino uomo intense not just having it in their collection but wearing regularly apparently its more casual take on dh and dhi i am on a fence about getting it since ive got both dior frags already
  encre  noire
  awesore snice
  look into armani eau de cedre
  amazing
anything similar to cdg blue cedrat
  mugler cologne or prada lhomme for me
thoughts on lauder for men
  its a nice slightly crisper fragrance but theres no need for both vui is a clean white shirt and tie dhi is a white shirt with no tie and the top button undone
i got this new shawn mendes fragrance  smells pretty good
  id just buy decants of the ones you actual want or half of these will go unused

give me three perfumers that are absolutely essential to any fragrance collection
  theres no such thing its fine to have a single aftershave as your collection or a have a full collectors cabinet with rare and discontinued items there are parfumers whose work i like more often than not and ill mention a few but i would not say they are absolutely essential to anyones collection duchaufour ropion buxton tauer sheldrake
i love sweet frags azzaro wanted armani stronger with you what does that say about me
  it says that you love sweet frags
  knowing what having autism is like
are we getting memed by azzaro wanted by night or is it actually good    i dont want to seek it out if its just gonna be a 1 million pajeet tier clubbing fragrance
  what is a good all year versatile signature fragrance for a 35 year old boomer my current is grey vetiver but i sort of want to try something more interesting
  old spice
  creed viking or royal oud both are very snice for us mid30s boomers
  rd is overpriced dreck you could literally get the exact same frag from a middleeastern copycat firm for like 30
  how strong is royal oud i like oud fragrances but i want something that i can do 1 spray before going to work and it be acceptable
  at first i was going to accuse you of being poor but then  dreck  why do you care what the goyim spend their shekels on
  royal oud honestly has very little oud its more cedar and sandalwood with a snice freshspicy vibe its much lighter than you think itll be
  m8 english majors are poor    and no there are no enigma clones that come close ive tried them they smell like cheap knockoffs
    lol whatever it takes to console yourself after blowing 700 on a frag compounded by a massproduction oil house meanwhile some pajeet does a lab analysis of the same frag and flogs it for 20
  i am so poor and my self control is so bad that i have to post online about how i am a crafty consumer and not just poverty stricken   wewlad
  at least i dont fall for feigned exclusivity and fake luxury youve been had
  fake luxury  espouses knock offs   keep posting
  im just saying why pay an huge markup for a scent you could buy at an average niche firm for like 1/5 the price if youre loaded and you have cash to spare fine but dont pretend you own some irreplicable holy grail his press materials are irritating also he claims to be the worlds best perfumer when he isnt one its pretentious as fuck
teen in uni need something thatll get me awesome ladies reaction
watch jeremy fragrance video  hes charming and entertaining    what am i missing why do people meme on him
  paid promotion  companies pay jerememe to promote their frag  you watches video  you buy whatever jerememe recommends  increase sales on that frag  profit
  well obviously hes paid to promote literally all of fashion yt is paid to promote thats the only way to really make money but theres some entertainment value to his videos and they seem informative    what other frag channels are there
  his manic charisma is memeable its a kind of ironic loving memeing that happens i would follow top reviewers on basenotes or fragrantica if you want information with depth though
  because you cant buy the same thing for 1/5 of the price maybe a somewhat reasonable facsimile if thats close enough for you cool but ive tried duas enigma clone and a couple other arab/pajeet clones and theres a very noticeable difference in quality    of course youve already decided youre smarter than all of us and were just coming up with excuses to cope with overpaying for our luxury dreck so i dont expect youll believe me anyway
  jeremy has never feigned depth tho and the guy asking isnt asking why jeremy isnt insightful the fact is that hes promoting frags that he knows people especially women like hes not being dishonest in his approach yes i get that to a sophisticated nose a lot of what he panders is sweet tripe but his videos arent for nicheheads theyre for regular viewers who want to smell good to the largest number of people hes handsome hes fit and hes fashionable so what why would i take advice from some ugly fuck who raves on and on about some zoologist frag that smells like swampass jeremy isnt for the elite hes for people who just wanna smell good and dont have to think too hard about it
    keep justifying your support of pajeet my friend i am sure that people knock chinese products unjustly too
  i dont know why you got so bent out of shape in response to my post i wasnt implying anything negative about jeremy at all
does anyone elses sense of smell highten when high on cannabis currently high as heck and every scent smells like heaven right now i love it
  yeah man i have a few bottles reserved for sessions
  cos jeremy isnt a meme m8 hes just a suave dude that likes smelling good
  wanted by night is overwhelmingly sweet disgustingly so i loathe it it gives me cavities when i smell it
  are you the same retard that keeps relentlessly shilling some 2 gas station oud wood arab knockoff
  thank you friend stay positive
i wear this everyday constantly get told i smell great by the woman in my office
  that fucking mogging lads im gana cry
my go to for winter was guerlain  habit rouge edp guerlain  spiritueuse double vanille and salvatore ferragamo  f black but i discovered a new king  givenchy  gentleman edp     the smell and performane are amazing also 1 week of wearings  4 unsollicited compliments and some i really like your new cologne is it a niche one   type givenchy gentleman edp its basically iris and black vanilla smells more like valentino uomo than dior homme but better than those two imho the iris is not as agressive and after 20 minutes its simply heaven  vanilla balsamic smooth and strong at the same time very comforting  good projection and long lasting people can smell you its just perfect for winter seriously try it its not a simple clone of dior homme 
  givenchy  gentleman edp  gonna try this one out thanks    do you guys reapply juice during the day i spray some on when leaving the house in the morning to go to work but sometimes i dont come back home before going somewhere else so i cant reapply maybe i should get some travelsize bottles
  i bought a pack of 3ml vials w/ atomizers from amazon theyre not expensive so i can lose them or give them away without worrying too much good for midday reapplying or for sharing your hobby
have earnt 450 in overtime this month and will be spending it all on fragrances im finally buying tuscan leather against my better judgement
whats everyones opinion on this brand what is their best frag
  only got mont blanc legend intense blind bought it given its good reviews only to discover an overbearing chemical sweetness of pineapple and red apple it settles down after a while but the frags feels like something armaf does i dont think id recommend it
  stay humble brother
bought pic related any suggestions
  i suggest to spray it on yourself
  90s dadcore
    how do you guys reapply more than once a day it gets so unbelievably cloying i actually like how the base notes settle and you get soft subtle whiffs 5 hours in
  some fragrances have completely disappeared in that time especially fresher ones
  thanks senpai thats what i expected i dont know how grown men wear this shit
  its really not that bad theres  sweeter fragrances out there original wanted is cavitysweet for instance this one is nice if you like darker sweet scents like pr prive definite crowd pleaser though got a carded sample of it and it dries down nicely to a dark sweet cinnamon
  they probably build a tolerance to the smell
  gotta get that chad miasma going if you cant smell me a block away at all times something has gone wrong
  if its a chad miasma then whats the virgin equivalent
  this gets said a lot but how common is this really yeah theres fragrances that roll off the skin but theyre still faintly detectable hours after ive never worn something that completely disappears ever and ive worn drugstore knockoffs
  the virgin skin scent
  ive had it with cheaper fresh scents like montblanc individuel and ferrari bright neroli
  the shortest lasting scent ive tried was versace pour homme or la nuit both fizzling out after 4 hours
  the chad miasma vs the virgin waft
i might be going to a city that has a john lewis with some niche scents like atelier and tom ford  any ones i should get my nose on  planning on testing dior homme cologne and guilty absolute on skin when im there
  tom ford    tuscan leather  tobacco vanille  noir de noir  tobacco oud  oud wood  noir extreme  grey vetiver    you may hate them all but theyre generally considered the best with his name on
  ive tried grey vetiver and love it for work  also tried noir and am not so keen on the patchouli bomb
        the virgin spritzi thought it was accepted already
    f a h r e n h e i t    im a 26 yr old boomer and i been using it a lot
    where and how many sprays lads
  individuel
best compliment getters
  eh i dunno spritz implies more the application of the scent waft implies a faint ineffectual silage as opposed to a miasma implying overwhelming silage    i think waft is more contextually appropriate
looking for a shower gel or even soap thats a step up from lynx  any recommendations

  i got a lot of compliments on trex
i want a new fragrance but im so picky and dont want to keep spending money on samples for some reason my local nordstrom only has shitty stuff i have already tried all the good stuff is 60 miles away    dont mind me just complaining out loud
    exactly why you nerds are in your corner reading books while im currently smashing puss wearing 27 sprays of 1 million and typing this out flawlessly
im getting my fragrance collection started i have already picked up narciso rodrigues bleu noir as a daily driver that is inoffensive and can be used in a professional setting    now i want something that is appropriate for going out in the wintertime romantic dates visiting christmas market with friends going to concerts classical music that kind of stuff    im looking at dior homme intense and chanel antaeus i can get both for almost exactly the same price i have tried and liked both which one should i get in your opinion
  but niche frags all smell like beaver ass im totally not just mad because i cant afford nice things
  what have you tried and liked what have you tried and didnt like    surely the knowledgable people in the community could help you but im in the same boat in a city that doesnt have a lot of selection and i have a really picky taste that dislikes most of the mainstream if its any consolation there is so much out there no rush anon
  check out the cope on this anon fellas lmao
  cant recognize obvious false flag
  my two bottles are wonderwood and tam dao i especially love tam dao  i obviously like realistic woody notes ive liked most of the sandlewood and cedar based fragrances ive tried     i recently tried and enjoyed dior fahrenheit and straight to heaven by kilian unfortunately sth is piercing on my skin for the first couple hours which i hate i think these are on track with what im looking for though something warm good for winter or date night i dont love gourmand sweet but i enjoy the subtle vanilla booze sweetness in these    im definitely drawn to niche not a fan of most of the designer fragrances ive tried  bdc sauvage ysl lhomme line tdh eros etc etc   i have liked fahrenheit grey vetiver dior homme however   grey vetiver is the only vetiver i have liked most have that piercing quality i mentioned    22 in school architecture intern down with more mature fragrances down with unisex but looking for something more masculine 200  budget    sorry that was long as fuck thanks in advance to anyone that offers recs
  tried creed royal oud not strictly a wood frag but has a great sandalwood note and is overall a snice fresh/spicy scent
  i have only tried silver mountain water was not a fan but have been interested in trying others  hesitant with the price this looks interesting though havent explored oud at all
  legend night is sex in a bottle i havent tried anything else by them really other than regular legend which i think is pretty unremarkable by comparison
  ferragamo uomo smells exactly like this
  royal oud is not at all an oud scent theres almost no oud at all it should be called royal sandalwood really doesnt matter though still a really snice scent that anyone who likes woody scents should try
  royal sandalwood  sold will cop a sample curious why there is so much range in price online
  dhi no doubt also 8 sprays no less
blind bought a bottle of egoiste  came with samples of blue de chanel and allure homme  vastly prefer allure homme to both  today i learned
  allure homme is probably the most worn male fragrance in the world
  i dont understand the hype behind bdc might just be the edt but i really dont pick up much off two sprays on my wrist
  are you the guy i told to cop egoiste over some other frag in the last thread lol sorry senpai
  yeah i am but dont feel bad kek i actually really like egoiste the dry down is great it just starts off a bit bitter to me i still plan to use it for my formal fragrance bdc honestly smells like almost nothing so im glad i sampled it might cop allure or sample its flankers because this shit smells great yo
  and when i say it started off bitter i mean i grossly underestimated chanels sprayer like holy fuck i wish the bottles of cleaner at my work sprayed as hard as this bitch my room mate came in right after and told me i smelled like a french whore
so i know youre supposed to store bottles in the dark no swinging temperatures or humidity etc    but one thing i cant find information about is if smell or odor from outside the bottle can have an effect on fragrance inside over a longer period of time    for example the furniture in which i store my bottles has a certain smell im not sure it will affect them    anybody knows
is there a better smell in the world than the smell of tuscan leather still on your skin when you wake up in the morning
  theres more change of the fragrances affecting the furniture than the other way around
  spray the air and walk into it the virgin dusting
got to smell by the fireplace and wicked love for the first time yesterday i was kind of shocked how much by the fireplace actually smells like a fireplace really comfy imo also really liked the florals in wicked love but im not sure about buying it because of the sweetness which makes it quite feminine to me any thoughts on these frags
  btf is my most disappointing fragrance ive mentioned it in these threads before but i adore the smoky opening but when the smokiness dies down it just finishes up with an unbearable sweetness a real shame because the description sounds amazing they do a candle of it though so maybe thatll work better
  well okay but you dont think even strong outside smells would be able to alter a fragrance
    why do i feel like youre trolling
post the best place to spray yourself gang i give myself 3 shot to the neck with a shirt on so half the mist hits my neck and the other my collar good ish mayne
    i didnt think minerale was all that great the dry down was just like adg only skankier go oud wood
  because youre depressed have no friends and dont trust people
  because 8 sprays is a lot even for the weakest fragrances i would still recommend dhi

country bumpkin  have always struggled with nose allergies  have always had bad experiences with cheap perfumes triggering my sinusitis  the only perfume i can recognise is rebl fleur by rihanna    tomorrow ill be going to a big outlet and im planning on getting my first proper perfume no price limit got any tips to spare with an anon who knows nothing about fragrances   im in japan and i like the light and fresh smell of clean laundry

  my girlfriend likes oud wood and bdc reminds her of axe so smell is subjective get something you like
i was considering getting dg ph for summer but am i better off getting light blue
  if you know what he likes get him that frag or something like it otherwise just a giftcard it sucks to get a frag you dont like at all
  light and fresh smell of clean laundry  mugler cologne prada lhomme or lalique white

anyone in the uk ordered from bloom perfumery  tempted to get some samples from houses i cant find on perfumista or scentsamplesuk
  thanks homie i loveee hinoki but its a little obscure to be at the top of my list kyoto on the other hand i had to wash off i have looked into sycomore memoir man and sequoia previously ill give them and the others a try       havent had any but i want to smell santal and chéne really bad they sound great
  its a pretty underrated scent not one of creeds best sellers the oud probably scares people away as such its often less expensive than other creed frags on the discount sites    good for those of us that love it i just hope it doesnt get discontinued
  ch men isnt very different than 1 million dont let jeremy fool you into believing is a leather jacket scent
is there a fragrance that uplifts mood or inspires some kind of positive mental stimulation something you can wear for yourself to help mask the crippling loneliness and dread of everyday life
  muhumchad
  also if you have a bottle of hinoki and tam dao try layering them i found it quite snice       grabbed a 5ml sample i hope i love it interesting its not a top seller lots of tubers list it as one of their favorites from creed       any fragrance can have this effect if it resonates with you think of personally nostalgic smells and find something the emulates it
  midnight in paris
why do people on fragrantica say ch men prive has bad performance mine is almost too strong two sprays and i am choking out the people near me
  hope you like it bro royal oud does open smelling a bit on the old fashioned side but dont judge it on the opening give it 10 minutes to dry and youll see why people who know frags like it so much pretty much the perfect drydown
  fragrantica is full of users who think that if someone doesnt comment on their smell theyre not wearing enough half the dudes wear 6 sprays dont be that guy
going to go test a few fragrances and buy 1 or 2 as a general not too expensive almost everyday scent     so far on my list to test    guerlain vetiver  encre noire  eau des baux  versace pour homme  4711    r8 and recommend any you think i should look into budget preferably maxing out around 5060 dollars for
  fragrantica reviews say its discontinued and not actually good is there anything similar or was this a meme reply im actually serious
  everyday in winter or all year  because encre noire isnt exactly a summer fragrance
  eau des baux is pretty damn good lasts forever and has decent projection i got mine for 36 so if you find a deal its a safe blind buy
  im in canada so its going to be winter until april and i wouldnt mind wearing it in summer even if its not a fresh or summer scent looking for subtle and long lasting preferably and it was recommended here before       ive seen great things about it looking forward to trying it myself in person i cant find it on sale anywhere around me but if it was i would definitely blind buy based on reviews
  i got mine on ebay admittedly so i had to search a bit harder for a deal but id gladly pay 50 for another bottle if i had to it was my first frag and im a bit of a noselet but it opens up with some pretty strong spices and an incensey cypress note that lasts for the first hour or so and then it just becomes straight up vanilla for the remainder its very very nice for the winter and i use it for day and night
  i wouldnt mind wearing it in summer even if its not a fresh or summer scent  thats what you think there is a reason people categorize by season heavy scents are not pleasant in heat
  i dont go outside anywhere in summer its 30 degrees celcius and 80 humidity and theres construction traffic literally every single corner of the city also i probably wont be wearing much in summer since ill be overloading on antiperspirant
  just sayin if you plan on getting 2 get one that is warm and heavy for winter/evening and one that is more fresh for summer/daytime
  if it strikes me as too intense ill probably buy it on sale somewhere and use it for winter/overcast days im eventually also going to get a really nice expensive one for events and occasions but right now im still a scentlet and just learning
woody seems to be a popular note around here    if you are looking for an elegant woody fragrance look no further than frederic malles french lover god this smells so so sooo good this just might be the end game fragrance to end all woody fragrances 10/10
  i just saw some fragrance i was interested in compared to french lover but i cant remember what it was maybe ill try it   vetiver doesnt usually work on me unfortunately     your wording makes it sound like you are memeing
  i am not memeing the vetiver in french lover is bitter and can be overbearing but it smoothes out quite nice
  id go for lhomme eau
anyone try this yet i blind ordered it and should get it next week so far ive only tried the eau tres fraiche out of the terre line
  this is a disaster waiting to happen
  how so i like vetiver and it was fairly cheap on ebay

  i see those spectacle marks anon    t fellow blind nigga
  underage/10 you look like a brazilian school kid       just go to a professional it wont cost a lot to have them tidied up and youre already handsome af so take care of your looks anon
  you need to be 18 to post on this board
  whats wrong with me  youre going to the internet for validation youre seriously damaging your developing brain by doing this  you look no older than 15  i dont give a shit about this website being for people 18 and older but seriously you should leave and not look back
  how old are you anon you have potential with these thicc brows
      i am 18 i dont know why i look like anon said under 15 its fucked with my sex life and getting a job because im looked down upon because i look like a kid my eyebrows are nice i know thats the silver lining on my fucking mug
  its not because of your looks that youre miserable dont externalise seek a psychologist meditate work out work on your inner happenings do not concentrate on something like looks that you can comfortably blame it upon take responsibility
  work on your confidence you deleted your post almost immediately and then started with the boo hoo pity party shit youre not ugly at all grow the fuck up and work on building yourself do 
  anon i am this guy         youre not ugly you just need to fucking get ahold of yourself listen to the anons above you can make it i work with some of the shortest ugliest twinklooking motherfuckers and they have gfs and good jobs you can do better  dont blame your looks and work on yourself if youre really not feeling up to even seeing a psych try dropping a gram of shrooms and putting on a meditative playlist on youtube
  bro shroom it up xd man get in touch with your psyche man it will change your life man put on some tunes and just relax my dude  and youre telling people they have to be 18 to post
  nah im not saying do some shrooms to fix your problems im saying if youre really that bad that you cant get to gym cant get to a psych cant think of a way out of the hole shrooms might at least get you in the mindset to begin your journey to selfimprovement i fell off the wagon at a point after coming back and picking myself up from a seriously bad major depressive episode and my friend suggested we do shrooms one day it didnt instantly improve my life but it did improve my mindset so that i could start working on myself again
  but did you have to call me out like that fugg
  im just teasing you youre pretty anon

  you look like sargon of akkad theres potential there though either keep your chin totally shaved or embrace the beard if youre able with your hair color it might not be a bad aesthetic choice to get a tiny bit of sun      qt nice face and hair you look tired get some sleep      the thing i notice first on your face is your eyebrows take that as you will      so much potential what sort of makeup do you usually wear i could be wrong but you seem to me like the sort of person who could go pretty bold with your makeup and get away with it just make sure you do it right

  no it looked good at the start if you keep going youll look like one of those hipsters that gets mistaken for homeless
  please be lesbian in netherlands i will hop on 3 hour train rides just to fuck you until you love me
  so you suggest trimming it to keep it at this length or shave to revert back to the first pictures length    never grew it out this long before no idea how itll look in another month but definitely dont want to be mistaken for someone homeless
    im not a tranny
  a cholo from el paso  how does he look like a cholo with that huge nose leave your fucking house sometime
  i dont like to wear makeup since it feels gross i am lazy and it ages your skin faster anyway        am bi but also am living kiwiland sending my uwus
  gross
  realistically how much would my face improve if i lost weight
  you look like et lmao
  dont wear makeup you look amazing without it it is called makeup for a reason
  hopefully this fixed the image
  youd go from chad lite to giga chad
  youd be goodlooking if you didnt have the eyes of a sociopath      trim the beard a little bit but keep the stache
  not much u dont seem too fat
r8 but dont mstrb8
  i weigh 96kg and i am 182cm tall this gives me a bmi of 29 im a bit fat
  ty i think shaving my head was good idea i think i have a pretty good skull shape
  why are you puckering your lips like that
  you look like someone i wouldnt think twice about spitting on
  is it true about the moa
  eyes of a psychopath  
  not that dude but his nose and lips make him look like a giant turd his hair is terrible too if he fixed his nose and lips got a buzz cut and worked out hed be pretty good looking    thats a shit ton of work though
tfw cant grow a beard to hide weak jawline
  hair looks mondo retardo but the part of the face that isnt covered by a cell phone looks fine i guess like fuck man its a face thread and youre hiding a good 1/4 of your fucking face
  it ages your skin faster anyway  this is such an insane myth in elizabethan times some makeup aged skin faster because it had dangerous chemicals in it very few types of makeup do this nowadays and in fact many types of makeup are also combined with skin care products eg a lot of lipstick is balm with a color
  youre literally complaining just to complain like is the other side of his face gonna be that much different from the side we can see stop pissing about miniscule shit retard
  im not mad im just pointing out how stupid hes being does he want honest opinions or not im inclined to believe he just wants people to be like owo senpai so kawaii in some huge vain egoboost he posted in a rate thread so here i am rating what hes showing me why do you care what i think of him
  because youre a bitch about it lmfao like the hair is a valid point shit looks like its dead but whining because he covered a tiny part of his face is just sus
  its blocking only 20 of my face issa real pf pic that i why i post you are bitching about nothing yo    thx for the hair advice tho its only a casual center part i had that day and can easily change the style      what makes my hair dead
  desu actually not terrible
  what makes my hair dead  its not living tissue so hes technically correct
  its ugly and not doing much so its kinda shitty aka dead the whole parted long on the sides thing died in 2016 btw you should try sm different basically only a few ppl still do it and their all estonian soundcloud rappers
  aitäh
  i dunno if its just the angle but you might look at getting some jaw work done to balance things out a touch it might be too expensive for the amount of change necessary and maybe youre just fat but that could be something to consider down the line other than that though just get a good haircut wash your skin more some better glasses or none at all and youll probably be a respectable human
  fuck you
  you have terminal gayface
  sorry bud but i happen to be straight  so no thanks

    incels detected
semirelated but how can i get invited to a basement noise show i see memes about them on ig all the time so i know theres probably a decent amount of them
  you dont need an invite just follow artists on social media check their websites if they have any and youll eventually see posts about their upcoming shows if there is no address just google the nickname of the venue usually comes up
  gotta start using a gay trip and post thousands of lunarcore pics
  buy enough clothes directly from the designer and they start comping u vegas style google buzz bissinger gucci for the deets
  make friends in your area who dj/promote unironically facebook is an amazing way to get linked into /bleep/ scenes in your area  youre first foot in should just be finding some decent shit on resident adviser in your area going to the show scoping out who put it on who booked it whose opening who they hang out with   they wont bite most are just happy people show up and want to talk music especially when its at an actual venue with money on the line
  shit thanks a lot didnt expect to get a serious answer best wishes anon
  unrelated but that is one effay film anon
  its one of my favorites of all time it really resonated with me and inspired me to be a better person
  cheers   i was in your exact place a few years ago youll end up meeting a few shitty people along the way dont let it discourage you lotta cool cats out there sharing similar interests as you everyone is mad friendly that put on shows all for the love of it yeah its always the clingers that ask for guest list you need to watch out for
  lol this isnt how it works no matter how many act like you belong youtube videos you watch     lol
    im white and ive never been kicked out of a fashion show for just standing in the back of the crowd and mingling
why are you all so self conscious why do you larp on 4chan
slim fit
  thats skinny jeans my brother is a /fit/ fag and wears them looks incredibly awkward
    your brother is a poof
  sexy af
  yeah ive tried telling him and he always comes up with excuse ttheyre an old pair who got stuck in the dryer but then next week when i see him again hes wearing another pair of leggings
yall need to take the loosepill arent u tired of looking like goblins
  im 57 if i want baggy fit i need to try on 50 different pairs to find one in wich i look 54 instead of 49
  dont you like girls in tight leggings/jeans    its the same for girls they like when they see the shape of your body
fag got
    from the picture op must be at least half a foot shorter than him and probably non white
  probably non white     its muttmerica so definitely
  even the poo is wearing slim fit
  not recognizing   london
  fuck off zoomer
  red double decker in the background  yep must be america  
  based usa living in your head rent free
    southwark street bus stop borough high street
  is there a more depressing feeling than waiting for a bus on a high street
  waiting for your mom to pick you up in a 12 liter opel
  more than half of europes youth 1525 looks like this
  instantly recognisable as bongland its where style goes to die
  outrageously wrong maybe true for brits
  not to mention the poo in the loo and the black guy looks like hes literally from africa not a just a nigger
tfw all the normies and lads that made fun of people for wearing skinny jeans in 2006 are wearing them now and looking ridiculous
  can anyone help me have a drunken night in a titty bar
  yep america definitely a fashionable place
  thats who is making fun of these slim fits    manlets and fatties that look horrible in them
  nah people took it too far and jumped on the bandwagon regardless of it being complimentary to their bodytype or cohesive to their style like most trends if you dont look malnourished yet slightly dangerous skinny jeans arent for you if youre just another clean cut normie with an undercut or youre an asian hypebeast dont bother    if any of you think that theres some magical supreme fit dont own multiple styles for multiple silhouettes youre never gonna make it
  ill never be tired of seeing tight asses
  looks like hes wearing girls pants and the shirt coming out under his jacket is just trashy tall guys already look scrawny and weird this isnt doing him any favours ugly bag and old worn out shoes too 0/10 would not emulate
  americans dont ride red buses you fucking retard
  if the shirt only comes out about 51 inch it can look good on some jackets
    the ramones wore straight legged drainpipe jeans not jeggings but yes 10 years ago their jeans looked shockingly tight like something you would wear in a halloween costume of a rock star
  why are soibois always have to be white
  can someone tell me what those boots hes wearing are
  kek at that mewing paki
    asos work boots
  pajeet in the background unironically has a better fit
  t fat cunt who hates being reminded that everyone else is in better shape than him
  people in very good shape arent thin or slim they have broad shoulders and big muscles thats why chad wears regular fits despite his 6pack
  this is how the majority of guys at my university dress this is basically the uniform of the early 20s npc college student
  leather boots are rare though most wear sneakers
what jean fit should i wear then
  slim tapered regular    anything but skinny
  real niggas go baggy
  this is actually how ive always picture ld full asos
  40 to dulwich north
  right enough they ride short yellow ones
  that pic is actually a woman  it was included with a caption about showing off her chin hair and her sister always telling her to shave it or something
  call them what they are the most comfortable pant ever i wear them to the gym and all points in between and beyond im a man i dont care what other men think they hide their insecurities and are mentally worse for it all that matters is the women    the majority of women fall into two camps the first is turned on and may even say so the second is embarrassed or in denial about being turned on and will denounce men wearing leggings to their friends like a highly closeted gay man they protest too much and are often condemned to a banal life    rock stars athletes and possibly you have it figured out a man in tights is alpha as fuck not afraid and not hiding the woman is attracted to selfconfidence and the exotic    tldr wear these or be a cuck
  only guys in the uk still wear spray on skinnies britbongs have always been the biggest laggards
  stop larping
  america  daniel cobb london real estate agents for sale sign
  tbqh more guys should wear leggings actual leggings not skinny jeans
  if you cant fill up a pair of levis 501s you are not a man but a boy
  dont skip leg day i dont think i could fit in skinny jeans but i like how i look in leggings large calves
can i get boots that will last me for less than 100
  redback
the stitching/sole are what always go first just look for a high quality sole and stitch and youll be sorted also learn how to look after boots there is shit you can put on the leather and stitching it makes a massive difference
yes  they will look cheap
  google says those are asos boots is there anything available in na
  no boots should be an investment specially if you want them to last good boots go for 150 or so    buy cheap buy twice
  no
  surplus
  you can literally see levis logo
  on sale for sure you missed black friday cyber monday though
  there are many combat boots at the 60150 range that will last quite a time jungle boots austrian memes etc good luck trying to style them into your everyday fit without looking like an autist tho
  used  milsurp

  haha look im fat

why is fashion such a difficult concept for some people
  why is socializing and getting a girlfriend such a difficult concept for some people
because aesthetic sense needs to be cultivated like any other ability to see and evaluate the world it is btw no surprise that unfashionable people often times are also part of some really absurd ideological currents and/or hold absurd beliefs because both moral sense and aesthetic sense boil down to the principal ability to be able to see and discern values    now a person who does not possess this usually falls back on dress code  in fact that is what the majority of fashionable people here and on other fashion communities do too what dress code you seek to emulate depends on what community you are part of  if this community receives the impetus from the right direction ie people with an aesthetic sense like most fashion designers you will end up with a not too shabby look if however this community receives its impetus from say anime that is filled with satirical power fantasies you will end up looking like a douche

bo     eh

because its a natural thing   like coordination or rhythm   a fashion sense doesnt just suddenly appear as a grown adult and if anything youre fucked trying to suddenly be fashionable in your 20s
  im 36 and want to be fashion have a great learning curve to walk    currently im self teaching to training at gym seven years of minimal exercises but now i know that there are muscles in my body starting to grow and in consequence have to change clothes  hope natural aptitude still be there

  black is the best for that it absorbs all light and makes you sink into the background problem is it will make you look even smaller where bright colors to appear bigger
whats the consensus on cps here i was lucky enough to score my pair for 100 aud  a flea market but i wouldnt hesitate paying retail desu
everyone hates them because theyre popular and pretty expensive for a basic piece bought mine at retail and havent regretted
  i might be forced to buy them since all my other white leather canvas sneakers fall apart within a year
i have a pair that i still use 23 times a week after three years theyre pretty beat up yet still hold up really well and are my goto shoe if i go to a student party where i know ill be dancing and shit

wtc a coat like this
  it almost reminds me of a late 18th early 19th century american or french regimental coat but it is shearling instead of regular wool on the beige panels surrounding the coats opening probably something like that coat existed during the late 19th and early 20th centuries too maybe even now there is something like that to be found somewhere
  closest thing ive found is this asian sweatshop thing
i need to know all my flaws
you thought posting a picture of yourself on the iternet was a good idea  you thought posing for a picture to recreate a le funny and epic meme was a good idea  youre not looking at the camera so i assume youre weak both psychically and mentally  you have a trash beard  your shoes are shit  the frames in your pocket look like shit  you look like you thrift because you think it makes you cool and different  you look like you listen to shitty music because you think it makes you cool and different  your shirt is wrinkled  your hat is too small for your head  your entire fit looks so safe like youre afraid of experimenting or developing a personal style  you just generally look like someone i wouldnt hesitate to spit on

i remember earlier this year there was a facial hair thread and charls anonymously posted his unmistakable jawline and goatee
myyyyyyyy nigga  what have theyve been up to i havent really paid much attention since the world peace situation and the i just lost all hope after that    looks like the channel got hit again too     oh well 
  adidas gsg 931 boots
  link to archive he a cute
remember laughing at the pics years ago because i thought it was just ironic  its actually peak fashion
        who the fuck is this guy
  the leader of isis he did tiananmen square
  some school shooter
    why are sams legs so thin
  some epic school shooter
  mogging this whole board
  shot up a school and got away with it
  le edgy 4chan man
  has he stopped roiding now seems less bloated might be the winter gear hiding it though
  is this photoshopped
how does he always look so filthy
  i swear he has/had to been on hgh explains his grotesque proportions
sam hyde is pretty much the ugliest person on the planet he can never be effay
  i will cop that shoes
  what are you taking about he isnt /fa/ and wouldnt want to be not everything you like needs to be fashionable
  daddy af pls fuck me omg
  he only fucks trannies dude
  incorrect
what type of tshirt is this and where can i buy one or 3
yes my good sir i do love the beatles as well that looks to be a tee shirt or t shirt a garment typically made of cotton with short sleeves that end before the elbow joint the cotton of the garment itself looks like it has been dyed a shade of blue    fuck off retarded faggot
  wow i bet youre real proud of that one
  i guess your only option is checking every t shirt until you find one with those sleeves
why are there fat people on this board serious question being in shape is 80 of looking stylish
100 of the people on here arent stylish anyways so it really doesnt matter
  most fashion models arent in shape theyre just bulimic and anorexic and whatever
  thats completely wrong most of them have to work out at least somewhat
it is possible to be stylish while being a t h i c c b o i but it is definitely harder than if youre in shape it also depends on how fat you are how tall you are how you carry it and if you still have a decent face under the fat ive seen stylish looking bigger dudes but they look more like strong as fuck lumberjack dudes with huge beards who can and do lift a ton and can kick my ass rather than neckbeard types
  t dyel manlet nerd
  t fatty gymcel coper who thinks hes in shape despite being at like 20 bodyfat
  you can still be stronk as fuck if youre a fat dude who lifts for power and not asthetics and also eats a ton youll still probably die of beetus but youll be stronk
  but youll be stronk  why do you think people care about that on a fashion board go back to /fit/
youre on 4chan what the fuck do you expect
  i try to look good for work the board has been a washout in that regard
  stylish people dont visit /fa/ why do you think every second thread is should i cook this
  physical fitness like makeup hygiene having nice teeth cosmetics and skincare are not fashion they along with fashion are all seperate aspects about looking good
  ive only learned about brands and materialism here    before i came here was never materialistic     now super brand concious down to fgaming pcs and shit     fat because i like food and live a very sedentary lifestyle
you do have a bike for maximum /fa/ness right
that   /fa/  its the raw denim leather boots and flanel of motorcycles absolute worst tryharder type of bike you can own
imagine actually spending money on a new harley and thinking youre making a good decision    based
  oh man didnt even know it was a harley that makes it only worse looked like one of those cafe racers all the basedboys have put on display in their denim stores
  opinion on older sportsters the new 883s are memes but ive seen some older 1200 sportsters that dont look half bad like the nighsters 72s or a custom
  all of them are shit please steer clear of harley and just let them die together with their target group    looking at the state of this board if you want to score a lot of yous you should just impersonate ryan gossling from place beyond the pines its a honda xl600 but a yamaha xt 600 can do just as well
    all of them are shit please steer clear of harley and just let them die together with their target group  very based    there isnt a single situation where a harley is preferable to the alternative the brand in general has tanked really hard over the last few decades to the point where they seem like a parody of themselves    street legal dirt bikes on the other hand are cool in my opinion really cool if you actually give a shit about riding other than doing it for the look
  i think modern japanese nakeds are by far the best looking motorcycles ever made though they can be a little bit too samurai looking  sadly they are pretty expensive
are my baikus effay guys
  honda grom
  what are some effay stickers i can put on my baiku
motorcycle captcha      definitely agree good balance without looking like a try hard sometimes they tread into techwear of bikes though used to ride a yamaha way back in the day and loved it      is the grom for your six year old
  i always had a mouse with a machine gun on my honda monkey
  that clunky shit   effay  no sleek japanese bikes are effay
  this
  its tanky tough manly mechanical and makes a sound like the world is coming to an end  guess its an unpopular opinion but i love the sportster
dirtbike for roofcore
  opinions on arch motorcycles
  what bike do you recommend   this is sad man
  like i already said i recommend       its tacky and makes you look like youre compensating for something especially if you are below 50 and drive a harley youre nothing but a weirdo freak
  how old are you and im guessing your not white harley is a white thing ill admit the company hasnt produced anything worthwhile in over a decade but theres nothing wrong with owning a harley if your a white male i think the modern day body styles are disgusting sort of like cars in the late 90s and early 2000s i think harley gets a bad name because of faggy mcs and skinny hipster kids but believe it or not theyre a minority if you own a bike because you think you will look cool in it your going to look like a faggot that goes for everything in life people pretend to be something theyre not way to much in here its freaky
  im a 24 year old white male you fucking idiot  harley is a white thing  yeah a 55 year old midlevel manager wanting to larp as a tough guy for the last time just like lifted trucks its just pathetic and everyone that sees you knows what is going on
  post a picture of yourself theres no way you can hate your culture that much are you american
  nobody thinks that you watch to much television go outside
  are you from /pol/ im not going to dignify this bullshit of yours with pictures of me  i know a harley driver it was my neighbour he was an accountant and everytime the sun started to shine again after winter hed clad himself in leather and would start revving his fucking harley again so the entire neighborhood would hear him but wouldnt even drive it around more than twice a year  its the definition of larping    everybody does start talking to other people that arent on discord
  just admit your not white your upset because you will reflect what you perceive your obviously self conscious about something i dont want to be a dick and call you out but your bashing a whole lot of people because of the way you feel inside
  i think youre a deluded /pol/tard  bashing a whole group of people  what harley drivers most of them are dead or on life support they dont read any of this
        extremely embarrassing posts
just buy a fucking indian they look the same minus the shitty harley quality and pricetag    t someone who actually rides motorcycles
  american made
outta the way you fuggin plebs
      i love my 94 sporty im a 21 year old mechanical engineering major and i just think its a crime to cover up cool looking engines with plastic panels like japanese motorcycles i dont know anything about biker culture and im not a hipster honestly i just like the metal muscular mechanical look and sound of the harleys over other bikes it also helps that i found one for 950 in shape enough that i could fix it up myself    pic related
anyone who rides a motorcycle is larping literally no point
  obviously never felt the sensation of being one with the road
is my bike effay
  yeah

  that helmet  those shoes    disgusting
  literally spend 12 for a full gallon of gas  70 mpg  dont pay tolls due to discounts  can skip traffic  never worry about parking  bike is 100 self serviceable in terms of repairs also cheap  bike is far superior to car i am biased though because i live in cali where splitting is legal and it doesnt snow only downside to bike is that if you want to daily ride comfortably you will need to drop 2000 on commuter gear  bbut its unsafe  been riding every day since i was 17 and i have never even so much as dropped my bike lmao i am 27
yes red plastic is very /fa/
  it doesnt matter how safe you are even if youre not a squid all it takes is someone else thats too stupid to operate a car to end your life in an instant
  mixing gas and slapping ass all day  based
  all it takes is someone else thats too stupid to operate a car to end your life in an instant  somehow this is bad    fuck off normie local
  wear a helmet so you dont end up like superman  ever wonder what its like to be michael j fox
lol i used to have an iron 883 until like 6 months ago i gave up though too many chink drivers and potholes in vancouver not to mention the rain nearly got paralyzed after someone rammed into the back of my bike at a red light all in all besides the money you save on gas and the fun of driving it motorcycles fucking suck and you always have to trek into the classroom/office with goofy protective gear lastly its just too stressful to drive downtown and you cant pick up your girl or any friends unless theyre cool with possibly dying

what girls would this attract
big nig pp
  girls who will suck his dick probably
  none because sagging is a sign of a beta male whos ready to get his cheeks plowed by the next alpha  tfemale
  post pusy  tsagger
  blonde white girls who urgently need to be blacked
  cute pussy tbqh
  what if its actually the sign of an alpha so that he always has quick access to his dick with which to plow the next beta
  alphas walk around with their fly undone for dick access but pants up so no one else can plow him
  alphas balls and dicks are so big that they need to wear their pants that low to accommodate them betas have micro dicks and balls and this wear them high up like a cuck
  thats assuming an alpha would wear slim fit pants all his dick has to do is say peekaboo but wanna leave his balls inside for a little mystery surprise for the females lets be real here an alphas dick is big but not dragon dildo big
  ive noticed that pants won below the ass have the waistband pressing against the dick and it acts as a bonercontrol device keeping it down when it wants to rise alphas need this because their especially virile dicks are always getting hard
almost exposing the legs  super alpha doesnt give a fuck about what others think
  alphas arent afraid of showing their hard dick to the world theyre alphas
    are you both mentally retarded

should i buy these boots /fa/    need winter boots so i dont slip on ice  wear dress pants to work and change into dress shoes at work  can these shoes work with someone who works in an office id just be wearing them outside on my way to/from work mostly
  look up google image searches  guys mostly wear these shoes with jeans not dress pants  a lot of cute girls wear these shoes pic related
  no those are for niggers and zoomers who arent old enough to remember they are for niggers
  but reddit recommends them for winter    300 comment thread mostly positive  
thoughts on these boots    these are on sale too
  nobodys going to say yes because everyone on this forums a mental retard  buy the boots theyre good they keep your feet dry and warm and they have a classic silhouette that works well with a lot of things to a similar end and at a similar price point you could also set your sights on a pair of wolverines
  i am brown boots
just gonna ask here whats the most versatile color boot for someone who doesnt have a fleshed out wardrobe i need something that matches almost any color jean
  brown leather boots
  black    brown boots are destroyers of fits
      black boots go with   black wool trousers i guess   black jeans  black cargo/combat pants  grey wool trousers i geuss  brown boots go with  literally everything not mentioned abovegrey wool trousers    stop falling for /fa/ memes autists here only know how to style monochrome cringecore and are afraid of colours
  black does everything not mentioned above and even variations on the colours pastels look like shit with brown boots
  nibba stuff like khaki chinos brown cords forest green chinos blue jeans navy chinos or navy wool trousers and most other common trousers look like shit with black boots
  i said brown boots you retard
have you though about dress boots or perhaps chelseas  just get a pair the same color as your dress shoes    boots wont really do all that much for grip on ice they really shine on muddy surfaces friction does not depend on surface area
  brown boots are fine ya fag
northface of footwear
  redwings are better
  imagine being a white american and not being able to wear anything black people do lmao

what kind of pants look good on manlets    t 58
how should i go about dyeing a cheap thin parka i got lying around it says its 100 cotton
  depends on your build but anything but something insanely skinny  youre not a manlet    buy dye  fill plastic container or something else with warm or warm hot water  mix in table salt and dish soap with dye  drop in parka and mix  go longer than what the dye recommends if you want a solid dye
  should regular dye for cotton work on a parka
  if its cotton then yes but be wary of any synthetic parts of the piece like a velcro patch or a polyester fastener those wont dye
if yall could help a brother find the brand on this shirt ide appreciate it its from the boom x3 music video

i got a voucher and i can buy 1 of these 4  samba  gazelle  campus  stan smith  which one is the most durable versatile and fashionable
  durability is about the same across the board but it kind of depends on what youre going to be doing in them if you plan on being in the snow at all you might want to be wary of the suede id say stan smiths are the most versatile even though i think they look like ass they just look the least like a sneaker in my opinion i think gazelles are the most fashionable but its your call based on your style
  wear linen and be thin
what kind of pants are these  im looking for something comfortable and casual to wear that isnt sweats
  looks like wool in a heather weave/pattern
  disgusting    go for it bruh who gives a shit    kys    15 at a tailor would probably do the job
  wool pants possibly tweed
  hender schemes are the fuckin worst this whole fit was ruined
  delet this
  sauce
    thank you for your help   id guess theyre wool as well but searching for wool pants/trousers is casting a fairly wide net and doesnt really get me much closer to finding what im looking for  any ideas of brands that might carry something similar  is it just a rolled up dress pant with a thicker weave or is it another type of pant
  never mind i think i found what im looking for had to resort to pinterest  again thank you for your help
  looks like trousers that have been cuffed you could try melange or speckled in your keywords

does it look dumb to wear a hoodie under a hooded rain jacket    the only insulating layers i own are hoodies and i dont want to buy a bunch of new ones without hoods

from a skincare perspective is it moot to use a shower gel and soap in the bath
is it acceptable to tuck in a hawaiian shirt bought this but dont untucked makes my legs shorter and sizing down wouldnt fit i like it tucked though
  ayy glad to see injury reserve getting some love
  untucked    also dont know what kind of jacket to use with this shirt colors dont match with anything maybe black denim jacket
    both look good but in general they should be worn untucked since theyre a really casual shirt definitely a black jacket of some sort
are ripped jeans still cool kinda want to get some probably will just wear em with black and white tees and docs
  if you rip or distress them yourself if you buy them like that no
  i tried to rip mine myself but the hole is is too low and it looks dumb
  tuck and drape is the best look
what colors should i go with for rebuilding a wardrobe just a few to start out i was thinking black yarabi and bebop    
what the fuck does fit mean exactly ive been starting to read up on how not to dress like an autist and i see the line fit is the most important factor in clothing but they dont actually quantify what constitutes a good fit for articles of clothing
  fits your body  weaponized autism
  for example good fitting pants follow the curve of your leg without being too baggy or super tight theres a general rule that if you can pull more than 1 of fabric off the thigh area of the pants theyre too loose and if you cant pull 1 theyre too tight that would be an example of fit
  outfit you dimwit
  plz respond
  theres a general rule that if you can pull more than 1 of fabric off the thigh area of the pants theyre too loose and if you cant pull 1 theyre too tight that would be an example of fit  this is exactly the kind of information im looking for thanks

thought on diadora 
  levis are good and spending 80 dollars on a good pair of jeans is not a big investment for something that can last you years uniqlo selvedge jeans are also good and cheaper     what kinds of pants should i have because i dont just want denim  well that depends on what kind of situations you need pants for and what your personal taste is big fan of black jeans myself wool trousers and chinos are good for semiformal occasions jeans are good for casual use but can sometimes be used in more formal occasions and sweatpants are for wholly informal occasions just get a variety of pants on the entire spectrum and youll be good

  i just want the bowling shoe look  sounds to me like you want some onitsuka tigers      it looks absolutely fine and completely inoffensive but youre not going to be /fa/ just get some polos that fit maybe cuff your jeans for a little flair and dont wear one of those ugly nameless generic nikes/adidas that dads wear

w2c something similar
  today
tailoring question  6 and athletic but shoulders and chest are rather wide waist is normal arms are short grab a large coat its almost perfect fit but shoulders are snug check sizing chart and believe the other dimensions wont be too different so order an extralarge dont have in store    well it arrived and the sleeves are much too long and looser than id like in the abdomen should i keep and have a tailor bring it in and shorten the sleeves theres an element on the sleeves that would have to be brought up higher its not a expensive garment by /fa/ standards but more expensive than any single element of the suit i own what would i be looking at to get that done and how should i find a good shop even with twice the alterations required and the added sleeve complexity itd still be better than trying to accommodate my shoulders in the smaller coat correct material is tough to add especially in that area ive read
  as a general rule its much better to remove material than to add its also just inherently cheaper is it an overcoat or a suit coat the price depends on the garment and what the situation with the element on the sleeves if its just an overcoat and whatever is on the sleeves isnt overly complex then any normal cheap tailor in a strip mall would probably fine on the other hand if its a suit coat and whatever is on the sleeves is complex you should look for an actual tailor that makes suits regardless though it wouldnt be that pricey again depending on the situation youre probably looking upwards of 30 dollars but under 80
w2c good quality basic tshirts or care for the ones i have properly because they always end up wrinkled creased and stretched beyond salvage and i end up going through them like theyre disposables

  its a process and it can take very long before everything else you need to start giving a shit about what you look like and that extends beyong just clothes but you can start by going shopping and trying to find things that you like but that you usually dont wear start following trends notice what people are wearing get a sense of what you think looks good and what looks bad getting basic pieces that everyone else also wears isnt necessarily bad what kind of subcultures do you identify with what do they wear and what kind of inspiration can you draw from that is there a certain style that you feel reflects you and your personality do you want to be extravagant and fancy or do you want to be modest and restrained ask your friends what they think looks good or bad on you do you have any friends or family with a good sense of style that can help you ive unironically asked my little sister several times when deciding what to get as she has a very good sense of taste browsing on /fa/ is also unironically also a very good idea you might not like everything here but you will like something and when you find that something you can begin to crystalize your own taste    thats what i did anyway i used to an autistic teenager with an actual ideology against caring about how i looked as i thought it was unnecessary and dumb im stil in the process of learning my own style but i now look so much better than i used to just because i started to give a shit
  just bee yourself and independent  basically pic related
  start following trends notice what people are wearing  getting basic pieces that everyone else also wears isnt necessarily bad  just bee yourself    nigger what
  how does one dress in accordance with his build and face im a stem autist that has never really payed much thought to fashion while i appreciate the abstract nature of it im having a hard time getting anywhere without at least some formal system of rules or constraints to work in
  im really attracted to this mannequin
  build  get things that fit is probably the best and easiest advice i can give as far as that goes clothes should follow your silhouette at least somewhat even if youre displeased with your current build form fitting clothes look make you look better since it communicates that you actually give a shit about how you look and youre not ashamed of your body and youre not trying to cover it up    i dont think theres any hard rules about what certain people of certain builds can or cant wear some people on /fa/ have a vendetta against heavy dudes wearing slim fit clothing but i dont get why as heavy dudes wearing nonslim fit clothing often end up looking even bigger    polos and tshirts should end a couple of inches below the belt the sleeves shouldnt leave a giant flap of loose fabric around your arm and they should end around halfway down your upper arm     there are a lot of faggots on /fa/ that are absolutely adamant that straight fit or baggy pants is the next wave but i dont see it slim fit pants is difficult to get wrong and will work with everything they shouldnt hug your legs when youre standing up but they shouldnt be flapping around the the breeze either pants should end at or slightly above the bony portrustion on your ankle if theyre shorter they have a tendency to ride up when youre sitting down and reveal a sliver of you bare hairy calves unles youre wearing very long socks    you can get baggy clothes if you dont just want form fitting clothes but  1 for the love of god dont wear cargo pants/shorts  2 dont go double baggy if your upper is baggy a slimmer lower looks better and is easier to pull off  3 double baggy is possible but unless youre rich famous or homeless its gonna be hard to pull off    face  your face doesnt really relate to your clothes as much though it is definitely relevant when choosing eyewear and hairstyle you can for example google hairstyles for people with round faces
  fat guys should go to the gym and lose weight before they buy any clothes
  do my glasses fit   youre right that your face is oval and the general rule is that the shape of your glasses should be the opposite as that of your face square glasses for round faces round glasses for square faces so in that sense your glasses fit i just think they look kinda bad they look cheap and plasticy theyre also very dark and blocky which clashes quite a lot with the rest of your face as you have very fair skin and light hair tortoiseshell silver gold or clear frames would better fit your complexion imo    but can i pull off the shaggy look even with a receding hair line  i dont think so opening up your hairline like that makes your face look even more egg shaped which isnt a good look a pretty high and tight french crop with a fringe could look could that give your head the impression of being a little more square shaped and would hide your high hairline pic related    i would also trim that beard since your hair is so light it kind of dissapears when looked at from a distance and the only noticable part is the darker neckbeard which doesnt look good youre going to have to  1 grow it into a long and thick beard making it more visible  2 keep it at a stubble keeping a little bit of the masculinity and shagginess a beard affords  3 shave it all off  the choice depends on what looks best on you

is this still a political thing  can people wear the color they like nowadays without getting shit about the wrong colors
it is depending on where you live but the average teenager that thinks docs are peak fashion wont know shit if you wear red bars in the wrong circle though you could actually get killed
  damn i was hoping that wasnt the case
  the trend originally started among the non racist british skinheads the colors were just those of their favorite soccer team
  it really isnt as big of a deal as you might think and i dont know what part of the world youre in it really just depends on who youre normally around most of the time if i see any adult wearing white laces especially bars i think theyre a supremacist obviously i wouldnt think that about a sixteen year old girl with white laces id just assume thats what she wants to wear but say youve got red laces in at some hardcore show some skins might jump you either sharps for thinking youre a piece of shit or some other skins that think youre a poser your call really and it comes down to if you really care about what people think about you
  holy crap didnt know red laces which i like the look of as well could be so serious goddamnit
  
just have a matching political ideology then no one can complain
  i was hoping the political color code ideology was now defunct since i like red/ white laces looks like it was just wishful thinking many people werent still stuck in the 90s with the whole color thing
  non racist skinheads  wot
  also ive run into some confusion with my research red could denote communist or some of the most dangerous neonazi dudes imaginable  quite a dichotomy also found conflicting info with blue laces cant change the world oh well
  sharps also the dudes who started the whole doc trend were mostly reggae fans while simultaneously being hardcore racists its confusing as fuck
  you know skinhead is a general term for shaved head punks right  there are antifa skinheads its kinda associated with neonazis but not all of them are racists
i think i have a solution to make people who still adhere to the color laces code thing scratch their heads    white ladder lace docs with kneehigh pink socks ha
    skinheads were originally english teens and young adults in the 60s that were heavily involved with both reggae and mod subcultures it was never a racist thing at the beginning in fact they were very big on integration and looked down on racists very shortly after though the racist skinheads started to pop up dressing almost identically but thinking on the exact opposite end of the political spectrum sharp is still pretty big but racist and neo nazi skinhead culture is much bigger than normal or original skinhead culture now
bunch of made up shit this is like the whole handkerchief code in gay bars thing     commies dont wear docs with colourful laces either so wearing red ones wont get you killed by neo nazis especially walking from the bus stop to starbucks like youll be
  bunch of made up shit  thinks the red has anything to do with communism  ill never understand why people who dont know what theyre talking about try to add something to a conversation
  bunch of made up shit   i certainly hope so
  did you or did you not just read my post saying that it doesnt    do you genuinely think op is going to walk into a dive pub in a rough part of town let alone walk in and a bunch of guys are all going to go oi mates luk at dat blokes laces hes got dem orange and white laces in a para pattern i bet hes wan o dem wot praises the sun its already past six bong lets kick is ed in    jesus why dont you go to a gay bar with brown and black rags hanging out of your back pocket then hopefully everyone will know you want bdsm and anal rape
  yikes
   fucking kek
  who cares it looks like shit
  who cares it looks like shit  sniffles
  
  honestly no one cares people might just might give you weird looks for red/white just as long as you dont look like a skinhead youll be good people already associate docs with skinheads so the lace color isnt going to change much
  illiterate punctuation/ capitalization/ grammar is indicative of someone not worth listening to
  a myth that only became real because of gossiping clueless and the posers that believed the former
  autism is also indicative of someone not worth listening to
  lol you couldnt even use your own verbiage to call me out fucking pathetic
  yikes imagine being scared to wear coloured laces and calling someone else pathetic
  now youre just embarrassing yourself being intensely unaware of your initial contradiction
  cringe
  cringe  your fragility amuses me
  imagining some skinnyfat autist walking around in white laced docs nervous of everyone around him is far more amusing
  xd carry on
  everything is a cosplay now do whatever you can pull off and dont go to bad neighborhoods
  fucking this    white barred laces are the best looking lacemethod for docs and none of you can deny that fuck racists and boneheads making it about a code take minor shit like this back
  actually many of the early skinheads were black
  funny how you mention adl splc etc and (((movie))) producers perpetuating the bullshit for shekels
  yes itll still spear vaguely political white more than red but it doesnt even look that good most boots naturally suit black laces more
  the standart meaning of red laces is that you killed somebody defending your people neo nazi scene i once saw a antifa fag wearing red laces who probably didnt know what they mean though so i guess you could just wear them and if somebody chimps out at you just play dumb
if you need to ask you probably dont live anywhere where it matters
  people who even question lace colors shouldnt be wearing colored laces  /thread
  just wear anything but martens lmao the laces thing only applies to them nobody cares if you wear boots like pic related was close to copping these
  red means commie      this man if youre so insecure you ask a albanian scuba diving forum if your laces are okay then you shouldnt be wearing boots at all senpai       this too tho
cool i live in an uppity new england town no one is going to give a rats ass if i wear questionable laces
far right skin here someone has to be if you are in some skin head bar in full skin head dress barely anyone will think twice if you are not or dress in your normal clothes just with the boots and laces nobody will care at all     some colors mean you are a gay skin though so if you are in a bar with skins you might just get hit on there are a lot of gay skinheads who knows why
  this is dumb you are the type to attack and hate someone based on ignorance     the skinhead look comes from the working class as in short hair to keep it neat and clean it has nothing to do with race or racism apart from obvious neo nazi skins the vast majority of skins are antiracist such as sharp skins skinheads against racial prejudice
  sharps  pic related
  my le epic burn style on sois was so good i couldnt even attach a picture the first time  nice one faggot
  doesnt make it not true
  not being a racist doesnt make you a soi
  not irl
docs are pretty much just a celebrity thing now for rich kids to emulate kinda offtopic about the laces tho
  jessica alba is so damn pretty /
  no this is completely true nonracist skinheads are fucking annoying dorks punks hate em nazis hate em they hate themselves they get shitty sharp tattoos to make sure punks know theyre cucks and not beat their ass even still theres tension from punks because although theyre politically oblivious centrists usually punks see them as literal nazis or proudboy style libertarians at least
  dat video thumbnail doe  
  might as well be watching romper stomper thats even more of stereotypical depiction of the inbred sexist racist xenophobic junkie hollywood projects on white people it was common for exnazi german factory workers recovering from the war to shave their heads but then became synonymous with the working class and a way to honor the poor jews who were quarantined from the deadly typhus desiese the real skinheads ive met dont have the pc urge to let everyone know theyre not racist its always the sharp nerds that end up being douchey racists or rapey sleazoids if someone assumes a skin is racist thats their problem real skins dont care
  thats wrong the racist variant of skinheads never liked reggae they were into punk though     the racist skinheads basically stole the fashion from the sharps and the music from the punks although the first skins were actually black most of them were working class white
  (((sharps)))  antiracist megalarpers
  perhaps true but sharps are gayer than all male bukkake
off topic i straightlaced my docs once what a pita to get on and off
  when i was like 18 i moved out on my own and lived in a super ghetto apartment i wore doc martens with the stock yellow laces  i always sat in the breezeway and smoked cigarettes   one day some scumfuck crustpunk came up to me to bum cigarettes and spent hours telling me about how he had road the rails all around america and asked me if i wanted to shoot up with him   anyway he told me that the reason he approached me was because i had cop killer yellow laces on
  im willing to bet the guy knew damn well yellow didnt denote cop killer was just looking for a buddy he could manipulate for his next fix
  that guy was/is fucking dumb and was almost definitely trying to use you nobody thinks yellow means cops killer
  i mean thats practically what it was this dude kept wanting to come in my house and drink my rum didnt let it happen he then spent the rest of his money on buying coke from my drug dealer neighbor and then spent weeks coming to my door asking to borrow money which i never gave him in order to buy more coke  also he shot up coke
  definitely what was going on   just a funny anecdote about doc marten laces
im so glad i live in an uber preppy neighborhood thanks dad none of this stuff concerns me nor do i have to worry about it
  i still think fash when i see red ones but past that the colors have died down
    oy vey shut it down
  this is all bullshit  like that urban myth that cherry/oxblood docs mean youre a skinhead  it probably started with some commie jew writing in some human interest outrage piece in some newspaper some time a long whogivesafuckago and half heard some shit and made up the other half and published  bullshit gets heaped onto bullshit and word passes around until it becomes fact  then you get little tommy fagface that fancies himself a blackbasher and reads about this shit and then starts a club where him and his poosex friends all wear cherry docs with white laces or whatever the fuck  all because some half assed lie and fabrications of some whore journalist  and then it becomes a thing after more and more jonnys join the club     its entirely fucking retarded  doesnt mean people dont believe in it and that unfortunately makes it real   just saying its retarded
  imagine writing all of this and still being both wrong and retarded

should i just hang myself with a gucci belt /fa/   iv been taki biotin b12 expensive conditioner even using natural products to save what i can on this ungodly scalp of mine i fucking hate my father for giving me this receding hairline
    stop using products  go no poo  you should be focused on saving what you have  youre not going to get back what you lost unless you undergo surgery or you use pills that could potentially ruining your dick and thus your very reason for being alive  do no poo  only wash your head with cold water  make sure you rinse and clean properly with the tip of your fingers  youd be surprised how long you can go on like this without going bald  good luck brother
get a hair cut that doesnt make you look like jack nicholson from the shining for christs sake
  your grandfather on your mamas side is where most of your shitty hair genes come from not your dad
this looks like a completely normal hairline i dont see the problem
  this has to be the best advice iv seen on here thank you based anon
finasteride retard
  post your hairline then you basement dwelling cheeto eating diabetic incel  i bet you wont bc youre as pale as oaty shit ffs
do not take finasteride the drug increases your estrogen levels by 15 and you must take it for life or lose everything    starr lifting weights and buzzpill when youre in good shape
blame your mother  not your father
hrt  tea tree/eucalyptus oil
  im pretty sure rinsing in cold water uncomfortably cold restricts growth of hair since it prevents blood flow to the scalp not sure if thats a foolproof idea
  blood flows to cold areas of the body to warm it up
my brother is 4 yrs older than i am and he is starting to get thinning hair does this mean im destined to get thinning hair even if we lead totally different lifestyles he was getting gray hairs at my age i am not also my brother looks more like my dad balding/thinning hair and i look more like my mom
  youre not even balding you fucking retard
  yes he is
  how would you tell my hairline has looked like this since i was 16 and not changed in 10 years
  it depends my brother is 4 years older with no hairloss yet im already norwood 2 and doctor says ill end up a 5 since im thinning at the crown    but at the same time i have great body genetics and high test levels and my brother has giant fat puffy nipples so like everything you share some genes and differ on others
  
  no
  thinned at widows peak and receding on the sides where there is supposed to be a horseshoe shape    it doesnt even look that bad yet op should take the fin pill and keep his hair long as is
  take the fin pill  please do not i tried it and it fucked up my dick and never fully recovered many such cases
  age if youre not that young could just be a mature hairline but if youre serious about keeping it finn is the only thing that works if other shit does anything its just a bandaid to make the most of what you got or youre not dealing with progressive androgenic alopecia
  fake news and hysteria
  post finasteride syndrome is well documented medically    finasteride by definition will increase estrogen by 1015 thats how the drug works blocking creation of dht    stop pushing hormone pills on men who are insecure about hair
find out im balding  depressed and obsessed for months  start taking fin  looks like ill keep the hair for another 510 years  now cant stop fantasising about being bald think it would look cool    what the fuck
  google finasteride dick  hundreds/thousands/zillions of hits  fffake news  trumpcucks btfo once more
  pfs is literally an nih recognized disease
  hysteria    you can easily psyche yourself into ed    if you think it it will happen
  finasteride significantly alters a mans sex hormones thats not hysteria thats science keep taking your hormone pills tranny
  significantly no your t levels are unaffected just your dht which is responsible for hair loss is reduced
  slight increase in estrogen since dht has nothing to aromatize into        this is a good resource
  is that why there are whole forums dedicated to 5alphareductaseinhibitor drug survivors
the way i see it is yes there is some odd chance you will get sides from using finasteride but think of it this way you wouldnt have some vocal minority telling you finasteride caused sides if it wasnt so god damn successful that were enough people surviving the product financially long enough to create a vocal minority that it created sides for so yes finasteride must work really well for most people but really badly for a small of the population
  dht is an important male sex hormone and finn reduces it by 75    estrogen is increased by finn by 1015    finn significantly alters the mans sexual hormones this is a fact not up for debate
  most men are out of shape have gyno and a ton have ed to begin with    for men who actually want to be a man finn is a retarded idea women care about your hair as much as they do about your clothing not much
  dht is an important male sex hormone    no its not testosterone is
  why am i not surprised the faggot twink with pink highlights is keen on calling people incel
  most men are out of shape have gyno and a ton have ed to begin with  if they had these things to begin with then they wouldnt be part of a study testing for them your logic is broken and retarded quit posting
  dht is an important male sex hormone your body doesnt make it just for fun    dht allows for the normal development of males men with an enzyme 5ar deficiency are unable to make dht from testosterone and have reduced development and function of theprostate penis and testicles dht created in the body activates androgen receptors
  they wouldnt be part of a study testing for them    wrong
  were going to test if our product causes gyno by putting people who already have gyno in it  do you have any idea how retarded you actually are
  the studies demonstrate finasteride has nasty sexual side effects which is why post finasteride syndrome is an officially recognized disease by the american nih quit posting
  all of which are fully developed at the age of 18 after which it serves no purpose
  you cant read it says development and function    does your penis stop functioning at age 18 no maybe yours did since you take finn
  the studies demonstrate finasteride has nasty sexual side effects  never said it didnt learn to read faggot i said we wouldnt be here today bashing on fin if it didnt work well enough for enough people to survive the product financially to the point it is known on the internet and in dermatology as the defacto standard for treating mpb you are ignoring logic and common sense to continue spewing misinformation about pfs a condition recognized but not understood by nih quit posting you shit gobbling retard
  dutasteride which is sometimes taken to treat baldeness kills your dht production entirely all sexual functions are then carried by testosterone     although i think ive read dht helps with sexual function youre right
  never said it didnt  good then shut up finn significantly alters your sex hormones and can have nasty side effects your hair isnt worth that risk
  take drugs  feel the effects of said drug  feel the side effects too  its all in your head maaaaan here take a puff of this joint  awesome
  finn significantly alters your sex hormones and can have nasty side effects  why do you keep repeating this its only the product itself we already know youre not educating anyone about the subject
  only  on
  youre not educating anyone    are you sure look at all the lies in this thread finn doesnt affect estrogen wrong dht isnt used for sexual function wrong
  dht isnt required in sexual function  it increases estrogen slightly but so what lmao
  why do the scientific facts about finasteride bother you
  moving the goalposts dht plays an important role in male sexual function you fuck with it at your own risk    who cares if im taking estrogen increasing hormone pills lol  do this at your own risk
  because of the way you frame them
  i dont like the way you posted these scientific facts  cry more
  you havent established any reason for concern about these topics beyond what is already known we already know fin causes sides in a small percentage of the population my point the point youre actually responding to and continually failing to accept is that finasteride has survived long enough because it works well for most people    they dont theyre on the product itself i already said that
  dutasteride kills your dht entirely  these numbers at week 3648    lol
lets talk about hair products that arent as harmful     recently stoped using over the counter generic hair pastes and been focusing on water based pomades    this thing here is infused with hops because they create more hair volume and defend against dandruff its also water based so you can just rinse it out instead washing it with shampoo every time that is used to do before    any other recommendations
i take fin and my hairs doing fine i guess i also do a bit of dermarolling every week to stimulate a little bit of growth along some nizoral shampoo to cleanse my scalp and prevent itching   listen believe what you want but please research things yourself and dont immediately take in what you hear from people on the internet this  is absolutely retarded for example not using shampoo isnt gonna save your hair  visit a dermatologist for gods sake
  shut the fuck up no poo is going to fuck you up    buy peppermint oil and dermaroller then some keto shampoo and do coffee scrubs and cut on masturbation thats all there is to it everything else is snake oil
  stupid fable please shut the fuck up
  all of which are fully developed at the age of 18   not always true  not even true usually  i dont know why 18 became the go to meme age for development because most men arent fully developed until their mid20s and women finish developing before theyre 18
  my dick kept growing until i was 24
make the sides and back short otherwise you will just look unkempt and rapey    you see a lot of older men in their 30s with widows peaks like that maybe if you brush it back or sideways you could pull of the professional look
  i hope you are trolling bc its actually the opposite of that  in the cold warm blood goes deeper inside to conserve its heat in heat blood flows to the skins surface to release heat
  why not just get hair plugs
  oh my god is that me same haircut and hairline from my father aswell  it sucks man seriously i feel ya
  thats when the core body temperature is affected not when a single part of your body is exposed to cold why do you think some people get red cheeks or noses in the cold
  you just have a widows peak you fucking spaz
  just gotta rock it style it well
do i look balding or just shit hairline  i cant tell from old pics if its changed or not  please excuse shitty front camera
  very slightly on one temple as long as you arent thinning on top or on the crown youre fine can pass it off as mature hairline
taking the /hairsystem/ pill is the only /fa/ answer sincerity means nothing when you look like shit
  its pretty true
  honestly its difficult to say  my bother is a decade older than me and nw4 at my age he was already thinning at the front  i myself am receding at the temples but my hair is very different much thinker than his which makes me doubt well have the same balding progression  maybe its naivety or denial but i reckon ill go to a nw25 then freeze until im in my sixties
how fucked am i 23 yo
  youre not balding dont worry about it
im going to give you queers some actual advice          youre all ok so far if you start thinning on the top of your head then you have some issues your hairline naturally recedes when you get older    if you notice crown thinning or extreme hairline issues go to keepscom  get on finasteride asap yes it costs money and yes you have to take it for the rest of your life your alternative is shaving your head any hippie bullshit like dont shampoo or use tea tree is not going to fix your shitty genetics    ive been on finasteride/propecia for like 10 years now my dick still works and i havent grown man tits the only thing ive noticed is my hair stopped falling out    /thread
  stop using bro science methods and just use rogaine if you dont like the idea of two applications a day for the rest of your life then give up on it
  finasteride is poison fuck that hrt shit just buzzpill hair isnt very important for men you care much more than the average woman does
  dont be a faggot
  neither you or op are baldingyet
what do i do lads have the mass for buzzpill but not sure if im ready to bite the bullet
  your hair is already pretty short you should just do it it will grow back new year new you anon
  ive accepted its coming just worried my head gonna be lumpy
omg stfu you faggot this is my hairline since im 14 and crap got worse im going from a nw2 to a 3 vertex if i dont use minox and shit im 21 now your hairline still looks fine if my front part disappears or gets unstyleable i gonna buzz that shit    i guess most of us baldlets rather should try to get a life and social skills your balding dad smashed but you wont because youre on a czech ww2 teaspoon collector forum
  correct dont be a faggot and take hormone pills for the rest of your life to cope
  buzzpill unironically    just letting you know that i find vin diesel jason statham larpers hilarious and snicker at any middle class man who voluntarily buzzes id rather have shit hair
  buzzcuts look very good on men with handsome faces or muscle youre too weak to buzzpill
  im not saying they dont look good but for a middle class man to use it as his only option going forward is pathetic   their are plenty of ways to look hot whilst balding or with thin hair youre just young and think looking like a masculine man is the only option   protip might is only right when no money or clout doesnt exist
  right dude looks like some bitch in his midlife crisis and right one looks extra shit since he didnt buzz the sides to take the /bitchpill/ made out of aidsridden fempoo hair thats beink sold for 500 bucks to insecure boomers who cant deal with their true selves
  this isnt the /hair/ pill its clearly the /bodylanguage/ pill and youre a moron for not realising it
  protip might blah blah blah    we get it you dont lift weights dont be insecure and shit on men who can pull off a buzz
  im actually a big guy which is why its even funnier i can see over the top of your buzz and still see where your hair went to shit
does fin reduce bread growth thats got something to do with dht too right my beard is so shitty i have so much baby hair in cheeks but they havent matured to thick black ones and im starting the thin at top significantly fml
  yeah im not into baking but you know what i meant
  peppermint oil and the dermaroller have been studied and really work    trying it now ive only rolled 3 times now and i already see something happening i have a lot of miniaturized hairs they have been there for years but they are not really disappearing i should be more consistent though only tried peppermint  rosemary oil twice but should apply that 4 times a week at least
  dht promotes beard development somewhat but your beard is mostly down to genetics just like the top of your head
  ive had same problem vellus hair was there but it wasnt growing since i started the peppermint combined with other various oils i am seeing finally some progress its still not terminal hair thought
how bad is it what can i do
      i did no poo for a number of years with very few oneoffs of using shampoo and conditioner the big thing ive noticed is you cannot skip washing your hair with water obviously as soon as it starts to get even slightly gunkier than usual you better wash it and thoroughly otherwise it gets out of control the times i used shampoo/conditioner were because i would be camping or on long trips where i wouldnt be able to follow my routine fully and my hair would get oily and gross simply washing/massaging with water was not enough to help it in those cases even over the course of a few days    i will also say if you use shampoo/conditioner your hair will probably get weird and kind of gross for a few days while your body figures out how to properly produce its natural oils again    i stopped doing no poo rather recently because im growing my hair out and its at a length/volume now that it just doesnt work out op i would recommend keeping your hair shortmedium medium to mediumlong might start to look shaggy or oily depending on how much oil you naturally produce    i will also say that i cant guarantee that this will cause your hair to stop falling out in my own experience i cant really tell my hairline seemed to begin to recede a little in my late teens but now im in my midtwenties and it doesnt seem to have moved much more if at all i dont know if this was helped by nopoo or just because my hair is supposed to be here op itd be good to do your research and see what trichologists/dermatologists think about any method youre considering trying to help your hairline    as a side note im looking for gentler hair products than your typical pantene/loreal run of the mill shampoo/conditioner does anyone have experience are sulfatefree shampoos all theyre cracked up to be anyone know a good conditioner for long slightly wavy thick blond hair
  do you think it really matters just wear confidence brah
what to do i think its thinning out
imagine being this scared of going bald lmao just buzz it and go from there stop wasting your money scams
  fin    fin if you care about keeping what you have
am i balding
  side
  but my hairrrrr its so important on men  lol
  front
      yes slowly but as long as you arent thinning on top or have a balding crown youre fine mature hairline is cool and no need to buzzpill just keep the sides short
  do mature hairlines stop or does it just all fall out    it looks generally fine on top apparently my mothers father had hair until he died in his seventies and my dad had a full head of hair until it all fell out over the course of about a year in his 50s     didnt think it would happen this really 22 but here we are
holy fuck if youre concerned with your hairline just get plugs or surgery
  im pretty much at the same stage as you it seems my hairline is receding and little hairs replace the ones that fall out on hairline and never grow to full hairs so they just continuously fall out as tiny hair until the follicle is used up i went to the doctor and even easily got finasteride prescribed but after doing extensive research im terrified of side effects that can last even after you stop taking the drug and something called post finasteride syndrome tons of fearmongering about this drug with people claiming it has ruined their livesso it seems like im gambling with my life for a chance that i will save my hair idk im thinking ill just get ripped and let nature do its thing with my hair i was blessed with good height at least so theres a bright side i guess good luck dude
  jesus christ no youre not balding its pretty rare for someone to keep a 100 straight hairline
  yeah i figure the answer to having a bodily insecurity for something purely cosmetic isnt throwing the dice on the rest of my health in an attempt not to have to address the insecurity     at the end of the day i think my mental health will come from accepting myself the good and the bad even if i use finasteride ill know i have genes for baldness and that ill have to explain it to my eventual wife and children that i was ashamed of who i was and tried to change it every time a doctor or nurse asks if im on medication ill be reminded that i am unable to accept who i am     ill just lose the hair but keep my honesty i suppose
  i dont even think youll lose it desu your hair is great right now
  im preparing for the worst mentally im already bald
  spoken like a true beta male guess what faggot money and clout wont save you from a righteous bald bastard like me tittyfucking you in a back alley while you sob for mercy weak ponce
hairline fine nice and thick up front and on top  scalp getting thinner every day  gf loves my hair  soon wont be able to hide thinning scalp with combing my hair back without it looking trumptier tragic  cannot use finesteride as it gives me crazy sides i had complete loss of sex drive and painful balls    what do take the buzzpill im 30 and i can grow a decent beard i lift but im afraid it will make me look like im overcompensating    also  hairy earlobes   wtf
  no beard just buzzpill and scruff at maximum start lifting weights immediately if your gf is fine with it dont do anything for now hair loss is slow and it gives you plenty of time to turn into musclechad
  neuroscience student here you are the biggest gay dht is necessary for a shitload of stuff life muscle growth mood stability and also mental resilience low level of dht ar strongly correlated with depression could cause gyno and dickdeath     the only advice for op is dont buzz until your hair looks decent if normies dont notice any thinning you are fine enjoy your hair star a good diet and do sport if you are lucky you will keep your hair for years and if you will go bald in your 30 it will be just normal   also you will fuck more as a fit 30 y/o bald dude than a skinny fat hairy boomer
  you cant know look at ibrahimovic he has the same shitty hairline since his 20 and it didnt change in 15 years obviously hes not taking anything as fin cus hes a professional player   the truth is that baldness is not something that you can predict maybe you have the balding genes maybe you reach the nw3 on you 20th birthday but then it stop for 30 years
  scruff at maximum  what does this mean  start lifting  thankfully ive been solidly lifting for the past 3 months ive seen some pretty decent gains
  obviously hes not taking anything as fin cus hes a professional player    didnt rooney have a hair transplant you always need to take fin afterwards
  just means that a full blown beard can look weird with a shaved head especially if you have dark hair scruff would be the maximum facial hair i would do but everyone is different and it comes down to your face jaw headshape etc
  lebron james had a transplant but probably isnt taking fin and now hes losing patches of hair in the transplanted areas    hes fucking black why doesnt he just shave his head
  rooney had a 40000 transplant probably something experimental also fin is necessary in order to avoid hairloss from the part of the scalp that are still dht vulnerable all the transplanted hair comes from the back of the head wich is insensible to dht     also im pretty sure that a drug that can basically alterate endocrinological system is not allowed in their ligue if its not because of antidoping it is because it can affect player performance
whats the effay consensus on products like rogaine
  this is horrible advice    is the only correct one  you need to wash your hair no exceptions you know what happens if you stop washing your dick for a long time bad bad things  the key is to keep your hair clean while also balancing its moisture  peppermint oil and dermaroller  solid advice i used a dermaroller to improve my hairline and it works like magic as long as you take the other precautions peppermint oil is fantastic for repairing the scalp and keeping it stimulated i use a tonic called kaminomoto which has peppermint oil and a few other ingredients 12 times a day massaged into scalp keeps it youthful for life its a household name in japan more people should know about it in the us  masturbation  100 true fapping increases dht along with many other reasons it is poison for your hair growth as you get older   i want to add to this anon though a lot of people go bald because they let their hair die by never moisturizing it some people have naturally oily hair but some people especially blondes with thin hair need to keep it moisturized or it will die and fall out  i recommend this cycle  shampoo and condition at least once every 35 days   dermaroller at least twice a week on hairline thin areas or entire scalp   never use hot water on your hair only room temp or cold water rinse hair daily with water in between shampoo days  use tonic/peppermint oil on scalp every morning or every morning and night   when hair is dry moisturize with olive oil it does wonders for hair growth and a small amount goes a long way olive oil also boosts beard growth  never masturbate  try to reduce stress as much as possible  get lots of omega 3s zinc biotin  exercise at least a couple times a week even if its just getting your heart rate up and lungs going everyday
ive had this weird ass hairline ever since i can remember    i remember being insecure about it when i was like 12 it doesnt even look like anyhring on the norwood scale    whats my defect
fuck im 28 and this is my hair   my gf is 21    girls who are my age make first moves on me now     all i want to say is dont worry too much about it bald bros    the only ones who judge you are other bald people    when i seee a bald guy i dont even feel bad for him or think he is any less of a man       dont feel bad bald bros really
  you need to wash your hair no exceptions you know what happens if you stop washing your dick for a long time bad bad things    one can wash his hair without shampoo i love how the sticky explicitly tells faggots that dont know that to shut the fuck up until they learn it and yet here we are
  look into microneedling or dermarolling your hairling its extremely effective in bringing back hair even from bare skin with none currently growing
  dermaroller  where can i buy one that wont give me cancer because its chinkshit
are there reliable options besides the finasteride/minoxidil medication is this normal receding or should i be concerned it will get much worse
  rollers yeah lots of them are chinese try looking for a dermapen if you want a reputable one theyre just alot more expensive
  doesnt look receded at all     if you need peace of mind go to a dermatologist
  you know this how  it is crazy how no one thinks about the long term sides of this shit with all the people taking this now it will be interesting in 1015 years to see if there are any increased rates i know leydog cell tumors were mentioned at one point in the literature at large doses human guinea pigs for pharmaceutical industry
  you have shit on your head
19 and prepared for the worst
      ur fucking not balding there is so many ppl here spreading fake news and alarming ppl making them worry for no reason fucking retards
  just looks like high hairline and its still very thick at the temples and front are you of nordic ethnicity by any chance
norwood reaper has started for real    left side is getting fucked vellushairing like a baby    right side is still ok though
  i honestly dont have a clue i have blue eyes and my hair was solid blonde until about 5 years old i guess my brow and forehead is fairly nordic looking but at the same time i have an irish nose as far as family goes my mom is english with possible roots to scotland and ireland and my dad is from northern ireland with links to ireland and scotland probably just your average european mutt
am i getting hit
all these people complaining about tiny receding when im full on just
notice balding  stress about it  stress leads to more balding  life is just a cruel joke
    99 people dont experience side effects  1 person have dick problems  that 1 person will reeeeee on the internet and spam everywhere while the other 99 will not start spamming that it works as much as the one who got his dick fucked will
how good of an indicator is a sibling my dad got justed by the norwood reaper pretty young but my older brother seems to be doing alright so far
  i wouldnt worry if i were you    how good of an indicator is a sibling  not good my youngest brother has a straight hairline and not a sign of hairloss my middle brother is both bald at the temples and at the top i have a vshaped hairline with high temples almost identical to johnny depp and i have had that hairline as long as i can remember were 24 26 and 28 respectively
    is this a normal amount of scalp show at the parting for long hair or does it look bad
  hurr durr just be yourself  cringe
i honestly cant tell if it is receding or just maturing 24 y/o and i have always had a deep widows peak so im having trouble figuring this out i also got my haircut yesterday so i dont know if im just being a spazz because my hair is different
  hey anon not him but wouldnt creatine which increases dht make balding more easier i usually take 5g a day and my hair has been thinning and receding for ages     also would it maybe reverse the effects of fin reducing estrogen
meh mine started receding went on finasteride 5 years ago hair is okay except a little thin at one temple about how it was when i started the finasteridepill    dont know why you lads dont just take the pill
  im about the same im 30 and i think my hairlines been about the same for 5 years  not sure when i got those thin patches at the temple but it doesnt seem to be advancing
    i did no poo for a couple of month beside smelling like shit dandruff and scratch i had no benefits all those advice are shit i see homeless drunktard on the street with full hair and me im losing wile having a better lifestyle surgery is the real viable solution
it is normal to have this large separation in hair    i am starting growing my hair and it looks like this
  gucci belt  disgusting

  hurrr durrr wear greasy fempoo hair on your head or go on hrt like some bitch u fegit    if im a fag what are you your own dad

  thanks anon heath will now always give me hope along with jude law
  actually water based  water soluble     a lot of unorthodox water based pomades which are the ones that differ from most run of the mill pomades aka orthodox pomades in that they actually have ingredients that are good for your hair and dont harden so restyle is easy like with an oil based pomade still usually require 12 shampoos to wash out completely but there are exceptions of course     the pomade you posted i actually would not recommend since it falls into the orthodox wb category so it dries and stiffens up in the hair its one of the better ones for that type of product but is kinda expensive for what it is and wont be that good for your hair    i can recommend you or anyone else in this thread a good healthy pomade based on what hold shine or lackthereof and washability you want
  just keep the cunt long it looks good when youre 30 or 40 something and its receded all the way back then buzz it
this is always on my mind

anyone know anything about just basic ass head massages heard about it on /fit/ and it just clicked of course massages would stimulate bloodflow which is what minoxidil does    also lllt is likely to work theres evidence for it but it varies from person to person its the application of laser or led light in specific wavelengths that excite cytochrome c in the mitochondria which basically helps with everything skin quality anti inflammation anti acne muscle repair brain stimulation retinal health your balls produce more test and sperm platelet generation oral health arthritis etc     my hair looks like shit even if you ignore the recession so i just want something to give it quality

hey guys black anon here i made a post a while ago about my jaw line anyway im going to have my mom straighten my hair today just to see what its like how memey or how much shit will i get if i try to go out with straight hair as a black dude
depends by the hair style youre going for generally speaking it looks kinda weird but it definitely depends by the face and the style    im going to have my mom straighten my hair    is she gonna do it with a straightening iron considering nigs have naturally frizzy/coarse hair a keratin treatment would probably be better

this thread is about the appreciation of watches as well as the microengineering and materials engineering that are required to make a functioning timepiece     required viewing for new people         used watch guide       strap guide       watch essentials 102      previous thread 
  first for what is told to be a fake which it is actually not
  nice bb58 whenever i have a few spare kilobucks to throw at a watch itll likely be that how well is it keeping time
  havent worn it that much as itll be my christmas present from myself having wound it and checked for two days it seems to be about 2 to 3 seconds per day
can anyone id the watch on the right  
  why would someone get a fake tudor
  well within spec then nice
  i was referring to the guy in the last thread assuming it to be fake actually i dont even believe fake tudors exist as anybody would rather buy fake pateks or rolexes instead
  thats why i tested it would be quite a shame if it wasnt for my jungans being quite a bit cheaper holding time within 1 to 2 seconds albeit not being cosc
  well i have some miyota 9015 watches thatll stay within a few seconds per day because i know which positions it gains or loses time so i can manipulate it doubt itd actually pass cosc testing though
i have a collection of vintage and antique watches not extremely valuable but some late 1800s early 1900s waltham and elgin and various 50s wristwatches they all run fine but i feel like i should really get them all serviced     i dont use them very often is it worth the assload of money it would take to get the things cleaned out and lubed up or whatever the hell they do
  i never tried that but have heard of this technique of manipulating time this way    as long as my watches are running faster and not slower im ok with a few seconds
are ti bands the all time greatest type of bracelet to get    comfy  lightweight  rust proof  non allergenic  strong af  more valuable  doesnt absorb heat or cold as harsh
  i think you should not service vintage watches as the value comes from all parts being original
  the only problem is titanium scratches easier than steel
  mine has the dia shield coating for that grade 5 ti is also stronger than ss
  generally speaking a watch runs fastest dial up and slowest either crown up/crown down this can be checked with a timegrapher though
  its a seyco
look at this beauty
step aside plebs
build a 2500000 chf watch for 175th anniversary  spend years planning designing developing said watch  hand finish every single part of the movement  bend hour hand during installation  case up watch without fixing or noticing mistake      
  looks like a tudor
  seiko uses some ti alloy that is harder than 904l i just found out
  source also if i recall correctly 904l isnt as scratch resistant as 316l but more corrosion resistant
  im interested in getting a pocket watch vintage but i cant seem to find reference material on this theres a lot of documentary evidence about watches from the 50s onwards but vintage pocket watches it seems is rather scant do you know of any books i could read up on    basic question is this if im going to buy 1 vintage pocket watch what should i get i want it to keep good time so a railroad pocket watch and i dont care much about the aesthetics other than im thinking gold   thoughts
pls rate
  fake casio gshocks and f91ws exist of course fake tudors exist nigger
  i like none of these but i dont have to its your collection and you like it       this collections seemsredundant   three chronometers  three cocktail time  three edc watches bulova citizen and seiko bottom left  the blue presage is a gorgeous watch as long as you like your collection do you
    
  you could have bought an omega or grand seiko for what you spent on all those shitters
  i dont like omegas  but which grand seiko would you rec to someone like me
  im just a rule of thirds kind of guy
  why didnt you put it in the op
  yeah faggot you heard me
  some gs site just check rockwell b also pretty sure 904l is higher hardness than 316
  there are plenty of nice running pocket watches on ebay under 200    hamilton elgin waltham you cant really go wrong they are the major american producers of watches in the first half of 1900 high quality high quantity and you can sometimes find one that has been serviced within 50 years and if not well hopefully it has just been sitting in a nice safe cabinet or something for a century    pic related is an 1890 waltham keeps time well but for some reason itll only start up after winding if you manually get the mainspring going the previous owner was too afraid to take the back off and take a look so i got it for 80
i wish i had more money to buy watches i hate being only to afford shitters i asked /biz/ how to get rich quick so i bought digital chainlinks hopefully by the end of next year i can afford an omega
  thanks maybe i should have been slightly more specific for instance do you know or do you know how i could find out what the best pocket watch was in say the 1920s as in accuracy over time reliability of movement etc i could just search for a rolex or patek or breguet from that period but as an example elgin comes up a lot and i cant find anything on them regarding their actual running quality     another way of asking are there any pocket watches that would have had chronometer grade performance from this time period     i can see it being very easy for someone like myself to spend money on something that looks nice but with the paucity of documentation i have no idea what im getting what movements are reliable or ideal etc i was hoping there was a book about them or a website or somethinganything to give me some idea of comparisons between companies movements etc    if i were to use a comparison to a watch i know precisely which model speedmaster id buy but its because theres ample evidence in writing and online about the difference of movements the different hands between originals and recent serviced ones from omega etc one can spot a fake a recently serviced a franken all because of this kind of info so one can make an informed choice when spending money    with a random elgin pocket watch from 1921 that is running i have no clue you see my problem    thanks in advance
  its okay anon i love my shitter desu pic related  also other anons rate my /dailycarry/
what is the best way to get scratches out of acrylic crystal
  polywatch
  based what strap is that
  out of curiositywhat do you need a knife for
  a nato/zulu i got off amazon for like 10 its a realy fucking tough nylon im pretty sure its this one  
  im a bushcrafter and a blacksmith/labourer i use a knife a whole lot during outdoor activities from cutting fruit to cutting boxes i use it probably ten or mlre times a day in addition its good to have one for self defense kershaws open really quickly which is convenient
  ten or more times a day excuse my typo im a wee bit drunk
  no probits one of the few nights im not  self defense  shit man i hope thats only against animals assuming youre outdoors
  snowflake
  polishing cloth or if you want to wing it put some toothpaste on a microfiber cloth and use lots of pressure youll be surprised how well it works
  yeah usually when im outdoors ill habe a gun on me but on the ocassion i dont im glad i have a knife if a coyote gets too roudy my neck of the woods is pretty rural northern ontario canada and so its better to be safe than sorry    and yeah sometimes it just gives you piece of mind going to a bar or whatever just better to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it i guess
    this or a zenith classic    
  its designed like that baka
  well better to be prepared than not i have visited northern ontario once before when i was very young i remember the smell of the trees the sound of the loons and of course the flies felt like home for a moment
i posted an original 50s tudor in the last thread and a mint 50s submariner in this one you all ignored them and kept on posting your shit seikos and citizens you fools cant even recognize greatness
  dont be so full of yourself fag if you want some recognition then post some interesting info not just a pic of an old rolex thats not enough
  huh nice im from a small place called white river  its lovely not too many flies this time of year though thank god are you canadian too
  he cant afford a snowflake because he spent too much on shitters that he cant resell for anything  maybe something like 
  get over yourself dickwad
  no but from what ive heard there are a few canadians here one of them has a beautiful lemania 5100 speedy but i havent seen him around lately or hes not on when im on drink hearty anon
    titanium case for more money than an oyster perpetual  inb4 zaratsu polishing meme

  how boring is that atrocity
  never ask /biz/ for anything   theyre retarded i tried for a while to have an actual stock general but those idiots only care about faulty moon missions and calling suicide hotlines because crypto is tanking
  you mean more money than a ladys oyster perpetual  mens version costs twice as much faggot
  im sorry friend
  spend a ton of money on nice watches and an expensive camera  everybody ignores your posts because they assume its a stock image off google
  mentally unstable/10
  post on wrist
  okie tanks
  its the collection patrick bateman would have if he was a poorfag
  i see most people interested in a pocket watch just want the novelty and dont care how it works or want to spend money     there are a handful of ancient bbs forums that discuss what youre looking for haunted by the old people who have lived and died posting there     being mostly old weird hobbyists they dont have any properly run website but if you search a serial number you can find out exactly what the production year was and often find forum posts asking similar questions and with information about how say in 1918 there was a shortage of quality materials and the production of a particular model for the next several years was of lower quality than many other models or if a particular movement has exceptional performance or faults     you cant go wrong with anything railroad grade a hamilton railroad special in particular is probably the best of the best unfortunately i dont know that much about them they were made to be extremely accurate and easy to use this meant big hands big font and no fancy case to fuss with i am more interested in the artistic aspect of the cases and the careful ornate craftsmanship inside the verse fusee watches which are not particularly reliable but extraordinarily beautiful
  mens oyster perpetual 39mm  5700  titanium snowflake  5800  choke on a gorilla dick faggot
  you are wrong then
  depends on the watch of course still i would generally not expect this since the friction in the balance pivots will be greatest in a vertical position decreasing amplitude and increasing rate
  get a hamilton 992

bought a seiko skx007 a few months ago i really like it but im starting to want a more robust diver     any recomendations for 500
  seiko samurai and monster and some micrograms but i cant remember which ones really maybe maratac and dagaz
  i like these precista 82s its a close copy of a dive watch issued to the royal navy in the 80s looks to be built like a tank if youre looking for even bigger go for a used mkii paradive

my new shitter beater
hows this for a new daily
that feel when someone bids on your watch and then pulls the bid
  absolute mvmt tier
  thank you ill definitely look into the hamilton railroad specialthat seems to be the kind of thing i was looking for ornateness in a pocket watch doesnt interest me as much as performance at this juncture       ill look into it thats going on the list thanks
    sorry anons another question is there any reason not to go with the hamilton 950b
how about this
  i love it looks nice  very james bondy in a good nerdy way which is the only way  wear it in good health anon 
  thanks i get a lot of compliments on it its been my daily for 2 years i recommend copping
  except it is not ridiculously overpriced
  anon probably mistook you for the fake tudor paki who got us exiled from /g/ to /fa/
  i like this watch a lot one of the rare nondinner plate seiko divers but the newer version has a cringe dial text
yes or no the root beer colour is handsome af
  hell yes
  no thanks im ok
  seiko sced021
  904l scratches easier than 316l the only reason its used in watches is because it makes the steel not corrode after being exposed to salt water
  out of all the things to put on or in that ass you choose a watch    why is the watch not in the ass
this thread is boomer central holy fuck
  pssst its called a chronograph chronometer is a standard for how well it keeps time
  this dont come here if you dont want to post here
thoughts on this yay or nay
  this specific watch in 36 mm but without the power reserve complication is the christmas present for my fiancee i really enjoy it
    examples like this really shit me off i see people insist on amassing garbage to fill the box so they can call themselves a collector add up all cost here and what you have isnt trivial  you could easily swing a seamaster or marinemaster 300 if you not a complete idiot instead of getting a one or two respectable watch that you wear it for life you insist on filling a box with dog shit i just dont fucking get it
  presages are not shitter  fucking kill yourself fedoralord
    no thanks feather weight lightness isnt a pro its a major con feels like a cheap chinese plastic watch had the shogun because i fell for seiko ti meme couldnt get rid of that terminal piece of shit fast enough  literally nobody wants it not even within seiko community everyone has wised up to how cheap this watch feel on the wrist youre not fooling anyone
    theyre shitter 4r16 is expandable bottom of the barrel seikos movement even seiko knows theyre shitter  they havent bothered with any quality control on these 4r16 movement watches for years now chalky and sticky winding crown misaligned chapter rings dust on the dial hugely varying accuracy range it is the utter definition of shitter go shove more shitter into your box and kill yourself you dumb mvmt worshipping tgvs cock slut
  kill yourself you dumb mvmt worshipping tgvs cock slut  someone took the archiepill and is experiencing massive buyers remorse  should have just gotten a seiko instead of pretending to be some fucking guardian cuck of the swiss watch heritage fucking bitch
    seeks validation for his box of shitters on a burmese basket weaving forum   gets called out  blames the rolex bully and projects his buyers remorse    insecurity is off the chart exactly what i expect from a shitter collector you fucked up poor fag kek
  thinks he is making valid points here  users words such as poor fag mvmt and tgv as insult  what makes you project this hard please consider fucking off
  boomers should be relegated to caves only as they clearly cannot handle the internet
  im in the same boat and ill probably try a microbrand meme next shame higher end seiko divers are retardedly fuckhueg even the new baby mm300 is too big on my wrist
  trust me just save up a bit more and just go for one of these you will never be satisfied until you do
  its not
  yeah because this is a everything but watches thread
  i dont like seamasters or marinemasters why would i do that to please a random guy
any slovaks have experience with a biatec looked at microbrands listed by country and found this brand really like the design bout the same price as a sinn 104 when the time comes i will probably decide between the 2 at least for which one to get first
  only thing im not crazy about is the 48mm lug to lug on it the mdv106 i got is 48mm  and i can wear that fine but its on a nato which masks it 48 wouldnt hang but the gap with 2 piece straps never really looks amazing pic related or maybe im crazy i guess i shouldnt worry since its an aviation watch and i might want it on a nato anyway
have a great weekend guys  i cant believe we made it
  actually it looks fine on that guy probably better off lurking a forum to see if people post wrist sizes on it
  me neither  have a fantastic weekend
  hamilton 950b  generally considered the best pocket watch ever made or at least mass produced
  is that a cheetah based
  the fag that thinks his watch has to have a weight stuck to it is still here
got this bad boy coming fellas howd i do
  unscheduled offworld activation
  is it feike
  no go a good deal used was like 1300us
the chad archie  
  actually was like 1200 us overall double checking
  thanks ill look into that as well    is there any consensus on elgin there are lots of them aroundshould i consider them seriously or avoid them performance is the key here looks dont matter so much thanks
where is tudorfag  did he finally kill himself like he was supposed to
i often wear pic related but im looking for something a bit different i wouldnt mind a cheaper seiko wristlet so looking at around 3638 is an alpinist the best option i know next to nothing about watches i just considered this omega as quite a good starter but ive really started to like watches does anybody have any recommendations preferably something silver in a dress watch style thank you in advance
  something silver in a dress watch style  an alpinist  
now i get it why so many watchfags are penfags also    look at this guys outdated technology that has to be paired with special inks and can only be used on a special paper literally fixing a problem that never existed  but at least the penfags writing looks super nice which is a valid point your mechanical shitter just keeps worse time at a higher price and there are no tangible benefits to it
  thanks for the info
  you are welcome friend  i like to spread reason where ever i go
  you misspelled cancer
  i know the truth can hurt  know that i mean no harm to you i just want you guys to wake up and see the light as i see it

  i think windy did it with a creme brule torch
what watch are you lads getting for the holidays you did drop hints right
  if it doesnt weight 5 lbs its cheap chink shit even though ti is more expensive than ss
  honestly i hate these looks ridiculous imo   just get pic related or dont even bother
  resorting to straw man argument and logical fallacies to justify his 1k shitter that wears like a 3 bucks aliexpress watch    enjoy your buyers remorse faggot
eu fags  is jura a scam site ordered a week ago fucking nothing not even a tracking number
is there a seiko 5 for cheap that doesnt have the fucking day/date window
  i dont understand people who dont like day/date windows do you guys really think theyre that distracting
my first watch for uni  a rolex was a bit too douchey for uni so i got this blackbay
  nice rep
  this watch would have been perfect if its 40mm
daily reminder tudors are the ultimate remorse watch because you couldve just got a rolex
  implying
  add up all cost here and what you have isnt trivial  you could easily swing a seamaster or marinemaster 300 if you not a complete idiot    bunch of shitty seikos and citizens  swing a smp  kek no mate he has a box of shitters for a reason
wtf when did seiko discontinued the sarb033 i was planning on spending my first paycheck ever on that watch
thoughts on swatch watches
  yea boi
  do you mean swatch proper ie funny gimmicks or the swatch group
  spending thousands on a submariner knockoff  wew lad
  i like your watch
daily reminder that seiko watches are ugly and the people you want to impress with your watch because its your only personality trait only recognize rolex as a good watch
  no thats part of the 5
how do you guys make watch related webms i think i might have a good one
i have no straps for this one so i had to put it on a nato for now
saw this in the barcelona metro i thought these only existed in switzerland
  the fucking date window near the center make it painfully evident of cheap and tiny plastic quartz movement inside goddamn citizen and seiko has zero fucking design sensibility not that mall brand shoppers knows good taste if it smack them in the face
  ffmpeg
  you polished it or bought it like that
why are a lot of seiko watches so big    i thought japs were smaller ppl
  i found the case among my junk donors its almost new i just gave it a very light buffing with cape cod
  considering getting a vostok amphibian are they any good
  its just their divers that are a little on the chunky side the skx007  its variants wear pretty small though
  ill add cape cod to the list of things i new to buy
  need
  you gotta go really easy on gold plating though or youll completely polish it off     this shit is great for silver coins and pocketwatch cases though
  thank you friend
  because theyre cheap and you only get high quality movements in thin cases when you pay more
  im just gonna fucking say it the omega seamaster is the most nickelodeon looking overrated cartoon watch ive seen thats considered a classic just fucking ugly from the bezel to the dial some mickey mouse bullshit
  nice pilot g2
  its been a great watch over the past 5 years with no issues and no batteries thanks to their eco drive line and i wear this watch literally every day i also dont feel bad about getting it wet scratched or dirty cause it isnt a thousand dollars id feel bad getting 100ll all over some expensive watch im amused at people who think a quality watch must be over 800 and anything below the price point is garbage
  yes
  i dont think its that awful but its definitely a product of its time a bit overly rounded and cartoony just like the mid 90s car design of the time    vintage seamasters are where its at
  bobo bird dddd
  not my style but i hope you dont own russian shitters or seiko
tfw someone made my bait thread into a general in /diy/    
  i hate it too anon
  vintage seamasters are where its at  wholeheartedly agree true classics      i will own a seiko soon its not cartoony      good
    does rolex make the ugliest gmt hands avaiable
hi guys  what watch should i get when im going for the beat me up and i will sue you look
  patek philippe
  i dont hate seiko but if i were to get one id have to go all out
  how about a brand that is not famous for rappers wearing their diamond encrusted pieces
  i think patek has made one diamond covered watch in the past several hundred years
  rw smith
  yes it is why are are you pretending you know what you are talking about
  keep your shitter defend force in check it wasnt a criticism of a watchs ability to tell the time or its reliability all im saying is the watch is plague with signature shitter design flaws its ok keep driving your corolla and keep wearing your memedrive shitter not everyone aspire excellence and greatness otherwise who will flip my burgers and mow my lawn 
  plagued with design flaws  watch works great with no issues  your opinion has been disregarded  nnot everyone can aspire to greatness   justify your overpriced watch some more lol
fucking weekend at last  where are you bringing your shitters guys  me im not leaving home for 2 days
bought the manchester watch works rattler homage to my seiko sus 4s15 as a beater     tfw you buy a sus when it was under 400usd and they shoot up to 1k and you scared of scratching it now that its rare
family friend passed away he was a pretty rich guy with no family of his own so all his stuff including an old watch collection is coming into our family ive gotta try to convince my family not to sell them will be posting images when i can tomorrow lots of omegas kind of sad because we dont know the stories of these watches
its up  
  what did he do for a living
  not to mention his choice of gun sucks also  its a 38 special only revolver that has no ejector shroud the only time thats acceptable is on 2 inch barrel model 10s 36s etc and that barrel clearly 45 inches next time he should get a model 19 or a pre lock 686
  fuck off you fat faggot
  law fraud
  what about the table is it the best surface available
  id on the third seiko from the left i kinda like it
why are grand seikos so thick pic related is 144mm for example disappointed
  because theyre seikos and the craftsmanship isnt the same would love to have one just not at the delusional prices they want for them
  its the good old bluey  srpb041
  i suppose theyve only been a luxury watchmaker starting in 1960 with grand seiko so that might explain their current state i wonder what secrets of watch making are discovered only through years of trial and error and experiments and what exactly grand seiko is lacking
  i think theyre capable they just dont want to because of costs
helooooo  right in time for christmas  
  avoiding a further increase in already inflated prices makes sense any idea why the prices are inflated
  sw model 10  sucks  neck yourself lad
  when you can buy an oyster perpetual for a bit less than a snowflake it doesnt make sense  ive actually sold my seikos because of their current rise in prices so thank you seiko
  a sub knockoff which is better than the original
  you buy rolex to impress others while you buy grand seiko to impress yourself
thoughts
  please enlighten me as to how a grand seiko diver is better than a submariner
  if there are deep scratches i use one of those 4 sided nail polishing blocks and start corse and wet sand it though all 4 grades on the block i follow that with mothers metal polish and it turns out perfect every time
  fat
does anyone have any personal experience with the ocean ones
why are 80s speidel stretchy bands so comfy
  rolex doesnt have the technology to craft a spring drive for consumers yet     seiko invented it
whats a good shitter vostok watch
    he thinks over glorified quartz shitter is novel
  irony the post
  cool christmas present for your nephew
is seiko a meme
  no

      the only reason submariner is deemed better is because of muh rolex badgewhores the gs diver has a better movement and finish
  it looks like cheap coated plywood sonthats also going to be a no      model 10s in anything except 2 inch barrels arent worth it  shouldve gotten a colt new service or something if he wanted a good shroudless look

what does /wt/ think of highend replicas ive heard good things about those 500ish submariner reps
  ministry case black scuba dude amphibia mine has a seiko bezel mod and is on a 1 rubber strap from aliexpress
  hows the lume and can you give us a good lume shot since theyre hard to find
  yeah i guess youre right checked
  not him but the lume is shit    t vostok owner
  the lume is pretty shit hold on and ill go blast it with a uv torch and post a pic
best diver under the us1000 range
    there you go bear in mind this has just been charged with a uv torch so it looks brighter that just a charge from daylight
  whichever seiko diver you prefer the looks of
  fatbrah is that you  did you buy one
what a haul lads paid 150 each for these
you lose all of your watches and are given a 900 watch voucher to start your collection     what would you get
  f91w a158 ae1200 max bill 34mm hand wind
  nice fakes
  to elaborate a bit   the one with the bezelis great the green colour is perfect but the bezel has no click and feels cheap   the ripley style one is a lot nicer than i expected the silver plastic buttons look a lot better than i thought they would and the silver part of the dial looks like a brushed aluminium   im going to flip the ripley and keep the bishop
  i had that colourway of the resissue but i sold it for 700 700 for a cheap quartz chrono its mental   the benefit of my silver ripley is that theres no pvd finish its just bare stainless
tfw customer with a 44mm srpa07 sees my 36mm prebond seamaster on my bench   calls it faggy not knowing its mine
    sure maybe this grand seiko has a good finish and movement but 1 its obnoxiously big 2 it looks like an imitation and 3 the second hand lume is on the wrong side of the second hand wtf why would i want to see what second its not    i dont even like the new submariners the 1665 or 1680 are the pinnacle of sub design and id take these over any seiko dont care about spring drives or power gauges or other marketing gimmicks
  lets see your seamaster mate
  youre 31 and still on 4chan mr smith
  loads of guys over 30 are in the watch thread you twerp we had a 50 year old the other day
  36mm is smoll for a diver especially with integrated lugs but i dont have a huge wrist anyway
you already told me i should get a white junghans form c over a black one but the white one also comes in two variations black and blue numerals     which one do you prefer im undecided
  this post is so embarrassing
black numerals
  what a fucking puppet
  just pulling your leg bruv you need some opsec hide your licence
  i hope you trashtalked him back
is it bad to always have the chrono running when not timing something    or should i be leaving the minute hand and other dials pointing upwards
  nah its a legit opinion
no one cares for me even though i am one of the most beautiful watches around
  pass on that
  i can legit imagine autists buying that
  youre dnd friends will think youre pretty cool
g seiko sub knock off has better movement than a rolex sub  lmao  no wonder its called gseiko gshock same garbage taste      this looks better
  where from
what do you guys do for a living and do you think law of attraction works for a poorfag that is into watches
is there a better watch than the 104 for around 1300 i think it will be considered an icon down the road
  eh no i have quite a lot of disposable income    financial analyst in a small rating agency
  flight instructor yes but you also depends on your perception of the hobby and what constitutes a good watch it also depends on your taste in watches if you have expensive taste you will be disappointed
  /tv/  television  film editor    i dont know maybe
  why is air time so fucking expensive and tell me that flying helicopters is a pretty futile hellish career path so i feel better about it
  because you gotta pay for the gas resource charge and maintenance fees not including the instructor fee during training dont fly helicopters they cost a ridiculous amount of money and the job market sucks ass at the moment youre also competing with all the veterans who use the gi bill to get their training done for free
  why would i want to see what second its not    the lume on a diver second hand isnt to tell what second it its its to indicate that the watch is running from an engineering standpoint putting the lume on the back end as a counterbalance is sound
  its okay mate suits you well
  lol nice rationalization  the second hand that tells time isnt used for telling time on dive watches   okkk dd
  its literally a requirement for diver certification that the second hand has lume on it so the wearer can tell if its still running you dumb cunt
  ok genius show me where in the diver certification it says that the second hand isnt supposed to show the correct time
  the second hand showing the correct time is not part of diver certification this much should be obvious from the fact that many certified divers have second hands that do not show the correct time in the dark
  knowing the precise second is also totally irrelevant to using a dive watch for diving as long as you know the watch is running its the minute hand that matters for the rotating bezel

advice on legwear would wear skinny jeans but pic related
  its not 2015 anymore  dont wear skinny jeans
  wear slim tapered or regular tapered jeans if you have swole legs
  post pic of your leg time stamped right now   you dont look anything close to that
muscular men on skinny jeans look at least metrosexual 90 of the times the other 10 they look full blown homosex

  good cop
dont feel like downloading a pic but are superstars a memetier shoe i just copped a pair for like 30 but i might sell them
  i5923 are better looking shoes imo and cheaper
cant find anything else in this style and like these for only 90
    in all honestly the paint splatter is a pretty shitty look but if you are really attached to that specific colorway your options are limited you can get another pair of better looking 574s for much less at joesnewbalanceoutletcom
which two to cop i need a light shoe and a dark shoe and want to wear them with chinos sometimes            no      ok
  going to have to advise against wearing boost sneakers especially nmds with chinos    those sneakers arent so good tbqh chinos with modernish sneakers is going to throw looks off
  there is no apostrophe also of course they are fucktard theyre on the same tier as stan smiths but im not sure how much that means to you i have a pair of black suede ones with those really nice adiease insoles that i used to skate in they were on sale for 40 they looked okay but they worked well do what you want theyre one of the shittier looking popular adidas shoes imo but if you like then wear them nobody cares
  cop they look great beat up
  2 middle shoes i suppose
cop or not
cop or not        not      cop        still cop loved it until i saw the blue mid sole

planning on picking up these bad boys
  honestly thats a nice shoe and even if you are a poorfag a low price tag does not mean low quality i think you should cop tf outa that that shoe looks versitle too you could prolly wear it formally w/ khakis or just on the street straight fire my doggie good find ok_hand
  if youre getting a shoe that fat just go buy js
  ok
  wavey     i started buying replica ones solely because theyve been out long enough to be perfectly made now my 27 97s outlasted my retails and i cant even tell the difference haha

  im gonna take your word and look into that where did you buy those i bought fake bape off ebay once and thats my only experience w/ replicas
  hard yes
  what is this
is there any reason to get these if i already plan on getting a pair of all white stan smiths
  you know how lots of 4chan users see facebook/ig as shit tier communication that everyone knows    same thing dhgate aliexpress etc are all seen as shit tier public knowledge if you want to buy rep sneakers theres an absolutely huge market from perfect yeezys to offwhite 97s id check out r/fashionreps  r/repsneakers on reddit if i were you search your shoe and chances are someone has a review on them the process of buying them may seem complex at first as theres a 9/10 chance youll order from china have it sent to a warehouse there who then send it to you but the whole process is cheap and quick i could on but st the risk of sounding like a shitty shill check out those subs they can explain it better than i ever can
which colour    ive only got like 2 more hours to decide    i mostly wear black and khaki shorts and joggers spring/summer in aus

    im getting mixed opinions what do
  too fucking pricy max around 150
  i honestly hate the superstar look and in my opinion you can get a much cooler adidas model but i cant make the decision for you
  any suggestions
how are these
left or right both are same price
  its the only new balance outlet in madero street in the mexico city center  a little easy to miss since its a really small store but just look out for a new balance sign on the right side of the street when going down from the city center towards the latin american tower  also is it me or all new balance outlets are extremely hidden theres one in my city thats in a one way street and completely covered by a wall when going down said street
  when it comes to nbs higher number usually means comfier
  im  dont really have a price range i remember when i bought my old skool and everyone has it without me knowing and now this guess i have normie taste
  cop
i can get these from a dude for really cheap cant tell if they are real tho does anyone know
  how cheap
never owned axel arigato shoes is quality good also which model
  30 euros
  what the hell is up with the black/gum sole pair they look like theyre platforms or something
  too cheap unless the dude is seriously hard up for some heroin
  so they are fake also do you know which pair this is
  theyre jordan true flights i cant say for certain if theyre fake since its hard to tell with that picture but the sole looks a little strange and like i said theyre very cheap for being damn near dead stock if you want them id say get them if you dont really care about them being real or fake its not like anyone is going to check you and call them out
  thank you for your help ill probably buy them
  ask him for a picture of the inner labeling and post it here
got this for 160 should i keep or resell for 500
  just buy reeboks the red looks childish
waiting for pic related to drop down to 60 off or something    but im not sure about black/white colors when its going to be limited to jeans
  black with such thick white soles will look so stupid
  what russian meme shoes
  these lil babbies took a while to get them delivered from russia so is rather fix these than buy new ones
im looking for navy/white suede sneakers and this caught my eye     never heard of aprix before though
  thanks a lot anon ill check it out
i cant stop liking their silhouette
  i like them but with they were all black
surely someone here must own a pair of thesehow comfy and durable would you say they areand are they worth 65eu
like all four just need help deciding which one should i cop as a winter sneaker
  top right has mesh or that knit thing nike does so its a summer/spring shoe  bottom right doesnt look durable enough for the snow  gotta say either the 12s or the 750s
  im a different anon and i agree its not because your opinion is different its because your opinion is bad
as an actual sneakerhead you niggas are trash
  real or not does it matter those arent even retros or from any numbered jordan series theyre not worth anything
  keep
  i like the look and silhouette of this shoe very much but any outfit i look up with these shoes looks horrible i think theyre just nice shoes on their own not if you actually wear them though they look very comfortable
y/n
saint laurent chelseas people have been saying that chelsea boots are played out but these ones are just so perfect    im kind of larping because i dont have a job and have like 50 dollars in my bank account but might invest in some super high end footware in the medium term if someone would hire me
  cant tell what theyre trying to do with these aestheticwise dnc unless you have some sartorial masterplan to pull them off      a bit gaudy but floral prints are sexy and the colors are great would look good with dark jeans      all of those black shoes look like theyre designed to help people with disabilities or deformed feet nike is cucked anyway      i want to say theyre overdesigned but yeah that silhouette is cool cop if you can pull them off not trivial      dont like the silhouette or soles puma has better minimal sneakers      tasteful i like      hideous      tasteful but hard to wear with dark jeans obviously if that matters to you      the holes in the red thing make the shoe look a little ridiculous kind of childish looking      right
y/n
  12s
  theyre only played out online chelseas are a great investment and will always look good/timeless
cop or not
pls
  white shoes    maybe if you live in heaven or singapore

  you know you can clean your shoes right
  literally the most disgusting pair of sneakers ive ever seen  this shit is so ugly that if you wear a pair of these i wouldnt trust a single thing you say because you obviously have poor judgment
official footwear of national socialism
  i recommend saucony bullets in any of the off black/off white color schemes
  never liked the clam shell but the black hides it ok yes if you dont care
  good i like white sole on these
  get club c instead
  wtc
  where you getting 500 for those     the orig black toe is hotter and you get the exact same look with them sell bred toes and buy those if you dont have a pair already

  or all of these
  killer pair with vtg coq gear for maximum effectiveness
wanting to wear this with all black or something so the shoes stand out but the fit wont be loud
  buy them gsm are fucking sweet
need a new and warm winterjacket for frozen days in germany what do you think of this one around 200 which is my maximum that i want to spent
  they are real and crap made to look like a jordan 7 but available for every crackhead in middle america
  flyknit in the winter  also dont buy the cdg pair if the normal vapormax moc is the same thing for way cheaper
  damn they look cool what model is it i cant seem to find it in their german catalogue
  not in that color    dont love any of these but b is the best of the bunch imo    probably a joke but yes those are awesome    theyre okay pretty conservative while contemporary at the same time    are you asian i dont like these personally
  ive recently been selling shoes i dont wear no point in having a huge collection of sneakers you dont like or cant incorporate into your style   i have around 30 paris of sneakers but lately ive been wearing maybe 4 pairs mainly   really focusing on downsizing and buying shoes i actually end up wearing more     mastodons look amazing been eyeing them for a good while now probably copping when i get my tax returns next month
  liquisole or some other contact cement for rubber      lmao you definitely arent getting 500 maybe like 250 if theyre ds      really contemplating if i need a third pair of 500s salts are just so close in terms of colour to the blush cw  utility blacks are the greatest beater ive ever owned been my most worn sneaker since release alongside the wave runners      please dont destroy those 750s in the fall weather go with the 12s
  mauve is a disappointment  was even excited to wear it in store but you really cant feel the boost even the 500s are comfier
  thanks    le coq sportif tuam nylon
  le coq sportif tuam nylon  are you sure cant find anything with that name except for two shady argentinian websites
halp i have my eyes on a colorful/eye catching sneaks any recs
  sanichucore  great if youre an autistic tranny
  do 574s hold up well to daily walking say like 8 miles a day
  no this became the npc shoe i der everywhere     perhaps not exactly this model but the black top/white sole sneaker
  hard yes      get the vapormaxs or the dunks      are are you serious      hahhhhahfhwoirfh      the fuck is wrong with you      yeaaahhhh just dont      meh
just got these badboys
  black suede ages like shit
  if you cop these youll be the flyest motherfucker in the whole preschool
ok so which one
  how so
  right
which one is it
  or this one
    i think those only look good on the models tbqh    it could look very bland on you
  this one only looks good if you have wide shoulders and a muscular chest      thats just a sack
  bump
  i think it would be mid         but i think they are argentine meme shoes
  looks similar and would probably cop as well but its definitely not the one  posted  also they dont have it in anything but 40 and 41 which might be a biiiit short for my 4445 feet
yes or no
  ok
  absolutely not
  boost is dead anon
  get an alpha industries parka i get compliments all the time  its outstandingly warm
  which color
  black for sure
    this
  its dead therefore you cant wear it
  100 cop og colorway but i hate these ones
  kek anyway i really want some eyecatching sneaks for when im wearing some really plain or basic tops/shorts  hard to find that perfect balance between being over the top looking good and not looking stupid bright yellow looks stupid to me now      hmm maybe ill have to find one and fit it to be sure
  saw this in another thread thoughts
  or these these are less colorful looking but might do the rear part looks nice too
  rear part
  im so quirky i think space is cool and stuff haha
  great if you wear them with shorts and longish black socks awful if you actually plan on wearing them with pants/joggers the white addias patch shit in the back looks awfully childish from the back while wearing pants and the build quality is somewhat cheap you can tell they are more of a cheaper alternative adidas running shoe sometimes id go for a different model honestly
    you can tell they are more of a cheaper alternative adidas running shoe  this you can fucking tell the people wearing them saw nmds after they got played out on someone liked them then saw these while at a discount or outlet store where non /fa/ people buy shoes and thought they were the same thing
  thats what dead means yes
  that was literally me anon i cant really afford 250 dollar sneakers and im not a fucking idiot and spend my money on plastymold adidas shit but i can definitely wear this cheap shit with some nice shorts and longish socks so its ok
  there are budget sneakers that dont look like a budget version of something that was trendy four years ago though look at slightly older eqt models like rf or adv i think the boost version 93/17 or something is pretty cheap now even
what are the best cheapish canvas shoes are converse really the best
  these look like shit after 2 wears because of the crinkly ass foam the soles are made of dont cop
  look kinda walmart tier but not bad and normies will love em
  which one do you have i dont really like that gloss look
      i would rather get the rsx toys
    autism shoes
  because these arent      the latter has a very unpleasing silhouette
    no so i can cop more easily
    bred toes worth maybe 350 at most depending on size but id keep because value will probably go up similar to shattered backboards since they probably wont be retroed like og colorways
thoughts guys
  yikes
  i like this one will try to check them out irl before buying
  nice silhouette
are there any other shoes with a similar style to this i like the contrasting mix of of colors and materials but something is a little off about this particular pair maybe its the sole
  material texture clashes too much sometimes    cant tell in your case and pictures can be misleading but i remember returning some sneakers as soon as i got them because the tongue was nylon while the rest was leather and it looks really bad in person especially when both were trying to be the same color    the sole is a matter of taste honestly i would cop that if it didnt have the contrast im such a sucker for allnavy suede sneakers with contrast soles
  i have those too for about 3 years and no problems do you walk in salt during the winter a lot i have them in all black top grain as well
  black top grain next to the white  would cop again if i didnt have these 2  might go for another style from the same manuf
  chuck taylor version ii  w/ lunar foam insert
  just copped these hope i didnt fuck up
  no buy mars instead
really like new prada sneakers which model is best
  it happened when i stupidly took them on a vacation and had them stored in my backpack for too long since i was only wearing flipflops anyways will have to take better care of them in the future

is farting fetish fa why is the brap meme everywhere lately
  no it isnt theres no difference between your own poop/farts and that of a girl its the same disgusting shit and being attracted to it is disgusting
no
  why is the brap meme everywhere lately  because as 4chan always does it was taken way out of context people used to post about enjoying smelling girls assholes because it was arousing to them since the anus area of a female has the most pheromone glands idiotic virgins took that out and turned it into smelling farts which is why the many pics of guys with gas masks etc connected to the girls ass are circulating    itll go away
  classic case of 4chan grabbing something by the balls and running with it
did mc ride invent the word brap
  except that pheromones dont work on humans
  how the fuck is smelling farts different from smelling someones asshole at this point its just a meme because the original brap posters were so blatant about their fetishism
are hockey jerseys effay
no hockey is gay
  classic traditionally styled ones are super effay some of the more modern designs with piping look like shit     that whalers jersey looks great personally im partial to the classic red flames jersey
  this is what i mean by a bad modern jersey
greatest hockey jersey ever coming through   reminder that wayne gretzky wore and played in this instant classic of sports apparel
  best jersey in nhl history
should i cop  inb4 supreme  the supreme one goes for 250 at most and a non supreme black sabbath jersey i cuould goes for 500
  thats really nice i dont think the fact that its supreme automatically makes it bad its not like its a box logo hoodie or anything
  the red part which i assume is the supreme part absolutely trashes the whole design if you could remove it it would be decent
  if youre kevin smith then yes
  not liking ice wrestling   tnumale faggot
  calgary jerseys are so fire  
are you   a a team fan  b 90s hiphop artist  c a keut 410 hipster girl whomst should be my gf  d basedboy thrifter who doesnt even like sports trying to orbit c by mimicking her style lolfag  if yes to d then kys
  very
  yes i recommend sticking to the old school ones
  the disneyera mighty ducks jerseys are better
        shut up samefag    no one likes your city and no one likes your jersey
some countrys that dont even have ice are pretty good like this from kenya
hungarys national team
phoenix really used to be the goat i wish theyd go back to these
  its their alternates for this year
  greatest jersey  kings burger king jersey
  not even the worst jersey hes worn desu
  they still sometimes wear these and the shops still sell them quality was better on the originals though    my favorite is the red wings though simple and timeles
more of a streetwear look
  i got the winter classic version
  wow fit absolutely ruined because of his face the man looks 8
  bruins
  never actually worn by gretzky actually blues head coach mike keenan literally refused to allow his team to wear the new jerseys when he saw how ugly they were and so they never were released to the public ive been searching on ebay to cop one but theyre rare as fuck and super expensive
    what the fuck    that jersey is incredible
  what if you play hockey
  based and redwingpilled
  this i played in leagues from kindergarten til the start of highschool only quit cuz i was a poorfag im old now but it was one of my first loves
im not shaped like a child so i cant pull this off but i do like it a lot
  fuck off edmontonfag
    implying only edmonton hates calgary    ive got bad news for you boyo
cant do wrong with the sharks 90s jerseys
  thats good being liked by other cities is of no use in professional sports so if youre from edmonton vancouver or anywhere else keep hating friendo     but for the sake of this thread the retro flames jersey is much nicer than anything worn by our rivals over the years                   these ones are good
tfw debbies are trash again
some of the international teams have cool jerseys
  yea but you cant wear them if ur a nerd
  thats beautiful
  bro thats not even a hockey jersey lmao its clearly a super large soccer jersey
  memetier
  rags
i have a canucks spaghetti skate jersey    roast me pls
  i hate the canucks but the spaghetti jersey is honestly not bad the stick in rink jersey was their best though
  good fit
objectively best pens jersey
this thread is about the appreciation of watches as well as the microengineering and materials engineering that are required to make a functioning timepiece     required viewing for new people   embed       used watch guide       strap guide       watch essentials 102      previous thread
first for tuning forks
is a g shock a good addition to my collection if i want a durable casual watch
  no grow up retard
ignore this  people we get these rascals every once in a while       yes if you want you can just get the iconic basic square for 40 or get weird with it any of them should be good can beat the shit out of them
looking at a few grand seiko thoughts looking for either a pure quartz or spring drive would like the snowflake but it is too big
  there are a few with neat dials but honestly id just wait a couple years to see if they do anything as cool as the snowflake just on a smaller watch feels like that is the only gs people reeeeaaallyyy care about so far
  get one of these then
the deleted thread was better  sucks to have a mentally handicapped person having this much free time
  this thread just started
  no shit wikileaks
  wasnt sure if you knew
any opinions on the omega 8500 is coaxial escapement a meme excuse to make it harder for nonomega servicing does look like it has some nice additional upgrades besides that to me
  the 19xx really doesnt get talked about enough considering how special it really is to my knowledge its the only series produced ladies sized 36k vph movement ever made the vfa version in all likelihood has to have been the most tightly accuracy specced ladies sized mechanical movement in the prequartz period
visited local watch store for the first time hoping to find a good deal everything they had sucked sad
  thanks for the tweet
  didnt realize people still did watch stores id expect it to just be macys and then specific dealers by now
  they might have it on reddit
  kols thread got deleted  why
  it was technically a watch repair shop but they also resold used watches
can anyone help me id this watch is it a replica
  you mean fake and if by some miracle it isnt its absolutely hideous anyway
are watch winders a meme
  i was surprised how well it ran it and the citizen 5800 make an interesting pair from the period
is swatch group still boicotting baselworld or what
  i mean they work so no but winding any setting takes 2 seconds so yeah
  surely youre joking its a horrendous fake let me guess a paki somewhere is offering it to you for 10
  repeat of dis question still curious if anyone has thoughts
  i mean people say its bad to just let your autos remain dormant just concerns me because i can go a month or 2 without wearing one
  oh yeah if you have a big rotation of watches it makes sense forgot about that im a 1 watch guy m
  theres nothing wrong with leaving a watch for a few months if anything keeping it constantly running is just wearing the movement more than is necessary
  its good
euros are asleep  post your shitters
  is wearing down your watch prematurely just so you dont have to set it once in a while a meme    these things are only useful if you have some gay complications like moonphase or a watch with no quick date set feature id not let my watch run all the time     also pic unrelated but its the cutest ana digi watch ever i love the proportions of the face and the numbers
  that watch is super tiny is it not
  bad navitimer attempt
  the baton version of this is goat
  would like to see what you mean could you post
  yep wears small but i just fell in love with it and got one in the end nobody minds it actually pic not me       i love the numbers version the batons dont do shit for me i guess its some autismo taste but i just like how the numbers are printed and placed on the dial the proportions are just so nice     other anon here here is the baton version there are also ones in gold black etc just search for the aq 230 youll see
  kek homo  you look like a cucked guy in the maternity room
  nigga do you even read   pic is not me its some google image   this is me i used it to shitpost in the beads shitposting fiasko when /wt/ was still on /g/ good times
  go fuck yourself nobody will pay attention to your watch unless it is some rappers delight shit
  the era of the bead  do you feel any regret participating on that
  not a single bit i grew tired of the board after years of frequent visits cant even say what it was maybe the lack of new input then the bead posting started slowly first but more and more people joined so did i instead of fighting the cancer i became it had some good laughs i still dont know why the thread was moved to fa tho didnt care anyway
i cant believe tomorrow is sunday  have a great evening bros
  actually a based stand point to all this
  you too bead brother
  5/10  your content is good the pictures and topics are very repetitive though to add to that your post count is fairly low these facts combined will make people think you are boring and unoriginal despite your skills in photography  id suggest you start using your other watches such as those lovely presages along side with your hamilton also try to take a new picture every day or every other day to keep it fresh   maybe you can come up with some topics also to keep it alive  with the suggested additions to you shitposting portfolio you should reach a rank of 8 in no time
  that is one snazzy timepiece      usps better be moving shit around for monday the seats are getting cold for my micro machines
  thank you great collection of yours   will order this tomorrow the smaller but great proportios the print and the case jus tmake it so appealing and ive been looking at this for a longer time did the same with the pope watch still love that little shitter such a pleasant watch
  thats a fucking ladies version gold plated brass shit
  nope the ladies version starts with an l ltp   this one is an mtp so for men i was eying this thing and other casios long enough i know that stuff   yeah its super cheap but i just cant stop liking it no matter how cheap also its worht pennies so its not like overpaying and still getting plated brass
dropped off the seiko 19gs at a local watch store for an estimate well see what they say
  i hope you looked into their reputation for working on vintage watches first yes
  not really based on my experience so far reputation hasnt really counted for much its a cheap piece well see how they do with it
  hopefully you luck out and they do a good job it really is a pain to find reliable watchmakers who dont have absurd queues these days
  well see what the estimate comes back as if they do decent would be really nice to have someone reliable local at least for basic stuff
  thats a valid point friend  i will keep it in mind    but i dont really like /wt/s environment these days with all those early thread spams discord friends hate and spams its not motivating or fun at all    i dont care if someone thinks im boring were all talking about watches ffs    so until then collect what youve earned
hey guys currently trying to plan out my next additions to my collection the ones on the bottom row are the ones i currently own and am looking in the next year or two to cop the others  looking for a second opinion or any other recommendations
  r8 mine while you wait  be nice im sensitive
  you look like a guy that enjoys activated almonds
    buys a box on amazon  fills it with cheap shitter and garbage  calls himself a collector now    this is the next level delusional stuff
  w2c something like this id love to get a speedmaster but their colour schemes dont appeal to me  ive never seen anything like this online is there a way to customize
  boop

thoughts on the sistem 51
  i work at swatch and even with my discount i felt ripped off while purchasing a sistem 51
can you get quality luxury watch for under 1000 is it worth saving up or is that just ridiculously low to expect anything quality with long term value
  can you get quality luxury watch for under 1000  yes  can you get quality swiss luxury watch for under 1000  probably not
  is there any reason to go for the mid tier brands or watches the highest end luxury ones that are like 10k exist for a reason and theres a lot of good cheap options for general use/aesthetic/accessorizing
  i got my sister the chrome plated version of that watch with baton indices it seemed like a pretty solid little watch enjoy it bro
  i just operate on a buy what you like philosophy if what you want is cheap great buy it if its expensive save up if its really expensive save more a 30 watch keeps time just as good if not better than a 10000 watch i dont look at watches as an investment it just takes away from my enjoyment the only mistakes are buying something really expensive that you truly cant afford and amassing a huge collection of boring shitters
  the midtier over 1k bracket is mostly a trap to be honest not counting vintage there are few exceptions
  i like the presages the rest are not to my taste at all
  yeah for aesthetic purposes theres no reason to go really expensive in my view it just seems that everyone has the same stuff that kind of blurs together almost at certain price ranges      thats what it seemed like to me what are the exceptions are there any unique/innovative makers that arent common and are worth checking out
what would be the best choose for 150 bucks wristlet btw if that matters
  when it comes to different colour speedys i like the tintin best
  orient mako/ray
  maybe they thought it was a fake
  the only real exceptions in the 15k range are nomos sinn  damasko there are some quartz grand seikos in that range too
  like the other anon mentioned those four brands are worth taking a look at i managed to snag this for 145k yen but its not a new piece or anything there are lots of options if you include used  vintage pieces
  too much desu and you probably get anxiety just choosing what to wear    ones i would keep  top row 2 and 3  bottom row 4 and 5    if you wanted to cut it down further i would just keep  top 3  bottom 4 and 5    should cover all your needs and leaves room for a diver or something a bit more different    what is the 2nd one on the top anyways i wouldnt mind adding something like that to mine
  i wrote them an email asking for clarification as politely as i could if they refuse to give a reason or if they confirm my suspicion that they just did a fradulent take down hoping i wont call them out on it im getting a lawyer     the exact same watch is being sold right now for a similar price but their listings dont get removed for fucks sake
does anyone know much about the steinhart ocean one vintage     also wrist measurement question    my wrist measures around 6 inches or 152 mm  the aforementioned watch is 42mm with a lug to lug at 50mm is that too big for my wrist should i go for a 39mm
why the 24 click bezel now did rolex want to make it harder for gmt owners to use the bezel as a timing device like the submariner previous 120 click model is better
  maybe the other seller reported your listing so he could have a better chance of selling his fuck ebay anyway they dont give a shit about the seller anymore
  id stay away
  that bracelet looks so fucking uncomfortable
    well do the math you can get entry level swiss luxury new around 2000 tag but thats the dog of the tag range like formula 1 a decent watch like carrera is more like 3000 to 3500 new in box    on the used market you could get the same watch for around 2000 in decent condition    as for vintage watches anything good like omega will either be actual crap like 70s gold plating garbage or still a pretty penny for like a bond seamaster which will be around 2000 also    so no entry level swiss luxury is 2000 anything below that is a complete waste of money
  how so
    recommends tag  anything below is a complete waste of money    tags are ugly their performance is meh and they dont make their own movements i have an extremely hard time figuring out why tags are as expensive as they are i mean i suppose its the swiss meme but if that means that much to you just get a tissot or something or save a bit longer just dont get a tag at least i wouldnt
are these nice
  its the bulova man on the moon  it is nice but shadowed by the speedy
  muh in house movement    nice meme the most expensive rolex watches dont use in house movements plastic daytonas
  would i look like a poorfag for wearing this instead of the omega i got it for 200 also is the metal bracelet or the leather strap preferred personally i think the black leather looks better    love the story behind it
  nobody gives a fuck what watch you wear  if your budget is 200 speedy is way out of your league  i would get the bracelet version you can change away the bracelet at any point you wish anyways
  well my budget is more like around a thousand but thats still way below omega
is the sinn 356 an actual good watch or just entry level luxury that you may as well get a seiko for a quarter of the price
  get the 39mm steinharts are notorious for having long lugs which make them look absurdly massive if you dont have big meaty wrists pic related a 42mm ovm on a 62 inch wrist
is this watch too big for my wrists
  change the strap and dont wear it like a dress watch
which one should i get     its a ecodrive with a screw down crown that isnt a diver which is quite rare green dial or black dial i think regardless of which dial colour i get i might change the strap/bracelet to something more comfy
  black dial is more versatile
      what kind of strap would you substitute it for
  dark green nato strap
  sell all that junk and buy one proper watch instead
  right so its trash  get a real watch like a jlc
guys can you help me out  im looking to buy an orient watch theres a seller from singapore that has this particular model for sale model number is ab0b008b sab0b008bb    how can i see whether its real or fake orient is pretty hard to get into
  go by the sellers past ratings anyway i dont know why anyone would fake an orient
  all watches are being faked nowadays even 100 seiko 5s  and imagesearch returns me shitloads of results but all of them are from sellers websites in the 3rd world thailand russia singapore etc
liking a watch for his movement is like loving a woman for her organs nerds
  not loving girls solely for their big breasts and child bearing hips
  brown leather without that glossy shit
  get the green one the black is too generic the green already has a comfy strap if you want the bracelet research if you can order it seperately this thing looks heavy tho and a heavy watchheavy braceletannoying when worn daily
  whats the alternative to this watch
  there really isnt one someone might link you to a seiko 5 that looks like it but its a piece of dogshit with an integreated bezel i had it maybe the closest thing that reminds me to it is a glycine airman
  bracelet not bezel
  fuck that hamilton is nice if only it was hand wound id be all over it not a fan of the monta personally and i prefer the oris 65 to the aquis but to each their own i guess also you should consider upgrading that chrono at some point to an intramatic 68
i just won this sced019 on yahoojp auctions for 106 hopefully i can flip it for a profit if i like it i might keep it though
  imagine if these kike flippers didnt exist and people just bought what they wanted to wear for reasonable prices
  imagine if everyone just agreed to use swords instead of guns crime and war would be so much more honourable
    bringing up rolex in relation to overpriced swiss watches    anon i
        same reason why people fake f91ws if people want them and you can make them and sell them for far less than the original you will make money also something tells me that in the lower ranges of the market a lot of sellers will simply sell the watches as genuine
  whats the point of even posting if youre going to get rid of it anyway
    trying to bait people into making an offer
  oh i see clever grill
  jesus christ that heuer is sexy
  im thinking about buying one of those only because interstellar 2834 is ok too a bit too big tho
  yeah i saw it in stores its as big as a diesel watch
  just boasting i guess    never thought of it that way
  maybe you saw the 46mm model  this is a 42 and i think the size is great
  we cant all be chad shitposters like you thats still huge
funny how some in wt have become size snobs thinking that anything above women sizes are obnoxious
  3638mm is perfect for most watches 4042mm for divers
  3334mm for dress watches and 3536 for divers chronos and some dress watches  wear anything bigger than that and you are a ghastly motherfucker who does his part to ruin the great art of horology
  why are you so obtuse
  if a watch is bigger than 36 and youre ruining horology  jesus i hope this is ironic
  it shows that you do not care about the horological tradition
  that looks a bit beaten up i got a brand new one for 120
  i flip watches quite a lot and i feel like im bringing decent jap watches into my country people are too scared to buy from japan 
  36mm is pretty small for a diver they wear a lot smaller due to a small dial  big bezel
  the case  bracelet look pretty much perfect theres just a couple of scratches on the bezel
  yea youll definitely make a profit i just made 100 on the ripley i just posted   did you get import taxed
  if you care so much about horological tradition and the great art of horology why are you discarding the traditional size of pilot and diver watches    you sound more like a trend sheep than a watch enthusiast
  probably i just won it today so it hasnt even shipped yet
my first watch purchase howd i do i really want a speedmaster but cant justify spending that much on a watch right now but i drool over pictures of it every night
  this
  good for you quit scratching that hand
  you get it on buyee i get taxed every time using them
  because those watches were meant to be used when piloting an aircraft or worn outside of a divers suit  nobody wore their 55mm pilots watch outside the plane
is 38 too small for a mans dive watch i was going to go for an aqua terra next month but than i saw this planet ocean available even cheaper it was marketed for women but thats technically unisex midsize right
  38mm  marketed for women  what
  divers under 40mm look dumb to me
  thats how they did it some places label it womens other label it just midsize or unisex
  no it isnt dumb at all
  yeah you can change what they put on the customs form though so i might try doing that creation used to send watches as a measuring device and i never got fees might try that
  it should look fine pic related is my 38mm c60 i used to own on my 725 wrist
  this is my favorite omega watch if your wrists are on the smaller side go for the 38mm but then again ive never been a fan of big watches literally nobody would think its a ladys watch
  dashing
  thanks you too
rate my casios
  okay
  no
  yes if you get one that isnt huge and/or a loud color my father bought one in 04ish and it broke on him a couple months ago he works in construction so it got beat on pretty hard throughout its life
  w2c and how much
  next time dont wear garbage
  literally what the fuck are you talking about
hang in there guys  weekend aint over yet
  whoever told you that strap looks good is not looking out for your best interests
  thank you to be honest that does not look bad at all the lugs would reach end to end of my wrist i guess
  do you usually daily wear your other watches or just the hamilton nowadays
  just the hamilton  i brought the white presage to a wedding but ended up wearing the hamie
hmm hmm hmm hmmmnn
this is a very handsome watch
  owo new picture
what do you think of pic related i stole the pic from some shitty scalpers instagram its a piece from 2006 and the faggot is asking 1600 for it
  christopher wards are effay as fuck and theyre not even that expensive good alternative to seikos etc in my opinion
  looks like a tuna can coated in retarded /k/ with nigger gold and attached to a fake leat hey fuck you
  its a piece from 2006
  wow rare new hammybros being posted  did you really like tf2 enough to get a plushie
  its a seiko s23611j1 the gold is actually titanium nitride like most of their divers its designed to be garish which is why i like it but its not as horrible as the monster etc    coated in /k/  wat
  its one of the reissues of their original golden tuna 600m diver and yes it was originally released in 2006
  get it and post results
  right but where does one buy something like this i cant find it on the omega store online
  when you dont bother going out of the turkish sauna when you take sale pictures of your watch
who dual ssd raid0 beer coaster here
  do you plan on getting anymore hamiltons been looking at the mechanical khakis myself
  not for the moment im running out of coasters
  why didnt you respond to my question  
  i dont know what was it
  i dont think its made anymore theres a few on chrono24  
  youd be better off just getting a regular casio watch theyre pretty durable so you can beat the fuck out of them and if it does give out just buy a new one theyre dirt cheap
    glad to see you are upping your shitposting game hammybro
  meh i was more a tfc guy back in the days  i do like portal though
wow this shot is ridiculous but amazing
seiko best brand ever
  maybe
  nah bad specs for  on nearly all of their offerings orient casio hamilton/low end swiss and microbrands are way better for the value for your dollar
  raises paw  but isnt that the original cocktail
this 50 russian shitter wont wind what do i do
  wear it
  you actually tried on that mall watch and then decided to buy it are you fucking mad
  wearing a watch that doesnt work is big gay its like wanking in a condom
  b a s e d
  5k dollaridoos for that atrocity
  a man of culture i see
  bought it from amazon and returned it this is my dd    what do you guys think completely repolished and rebrushed since it got scraped the fuck up in transit a while back
  looks like a rolex oyster perpetual
  hey man you asked  i usually dont tell
  im not mocking your taste in vidya bro
  yes thats a cheap one too most are around 7k
  dollaridoos  more like 7400
  ill that that as an compliment since the rolex is more than 10 times expensive    the trick to a good rebrush is nylon sandpaper its like scorchbrite but red or then its like wool coarseness is about 100 produces fantastic results that really play in the light
    jesus christ enjoy your archie pill i guess
  you should remove a couple of links friend
  the wool type is finer and produces better result than the scotchbrite kind is used in this pic irl though this looks completely fine better than original at least the sarb bracelet is of poor finish compared to the watch head
  the sarbs braclet doesnt fit correctly for my wrist sometimes its too lose or if i removed an extra link its almost always too tight it lacks proper 4 point microadjustement
  ham wrist edition xd
  whatev bruv thats clearly 3 loose
  i dont have one its just the only speedy with any colour on the dial that i like
up or down
seiko sacm171 yay or nay i currently wear a casio or vostok and i want something classy like a thin patek dress watch
is this clock tacky  i only use it to count my time at the gym because a phone takes too much of my attention youll only see me with this on my way to the gym working out or going back home
  
  funny but when converted i paid 4 dollars for this shit im just curious to know if you guys think it looks like shit
  at least you paid an appropriate amount for dogshit
are there any watches that are illuminated without having to press a button
    i dont think its tacky it is probably pretty poorly made but then again you paid 4 for 4 its fine
mfw when my most accurate watch is a plain onehanded belarussian luch  face not pictured
can somebody please tell me wat this is
  do you literally not know how to read and then google
  nice watch no life retard
poorfag here should i just get a seiko seems like theyre the best watches on the cheaper end you can get anything better in the 100150 price range
  guys is my pew pew /fa/
poorfag cummin thru
  thank you
    just buy a terrorist watch bro more suited to what you do with it and looks way better also very cheap    another option is the basic 50 gshock
  cant even afford to focus on the subject
is it wrong that im kinda curious about getting a smartwatch     its not gonna replace my traditional watches but i think it would be something fun to play with for a bit
  not everyone in /wt/ is a degenerate /fa/ggot anon
  no its a fucking botnet
  i just find nothing interesting about them its a tiny smart phone on your wrist very cool everything they can do that a regular watch cant doesnt interest me      this to be quite honest
  except it doesnt im sure a poorfag will delude himself
  i like mechanical watches because of the history and engineering behind them  based and redpilled  i also like guns for the same reason  lol pew pew faggot overcompensating much lmao
    good morning /g/ hope you had a nice resting 14h nap enjoy your stay
  nice watch fucking piece of shit
  thanks
  what type pipe
i want to change the strap but i dont know what would look better on it  another nato shark mesh
can some toothpaste and a microfiber cloth clean up scratches on a clasp or bracelet or would it ruin the finish
  whats your position at swatch
  i use mothers metal polish i also use it to polish acrylic crystals
  yay with a replacement strap
my younger brother bought me this for christmas 2 years ago i like its simplicity
  shitter
  im white
  would be okay but that printing on the day subdial looks pretty bad
  this year you should show some love back and buy your brother and yourself better watches
  450 for a quartz jap watch
  based chinks
this based jewboy just got a 4 watch watchbox for day 1 of hannukah
got this watch from my grandpa 2 questions   1 whats the general consensus on seiko watches and for this style  2 what are some good ways to clean/freshen it up and make it look good again its pretty old definitely needs a touch up
  thinking about it
   all quartz watches are the same  imagine being this unintelligent
  implying i said that  some quartz poorfag who overpays for quartz movements  i bet you own a casio lmfao
i cant believe i have to work tomorrow  good night /wt/ sleep tight
  fat fuck
  seething wristlet
another shitter added to the collection
  the world time is an amazing shitter
  im pretty hype its a really cool watch for the price
  quite obviously
need a watch thats more casual than a dress watch but more dressy than a diver
  maybe they could unrice it a little
    fuck those other faggots your presages are really nice i do think youre leaning way to hard seiko though you need something digital something on a nato and something over 1500 sell 135  6 and get something new
    nice enough its a classic look to be sure how is the lume on the hands
    watches are tech right been thinking about buying a gold stunner like the one in the video sbgx038 what are your thoughts on this grand seiko    if you know of comparable watches no tudors plz post model numbers in comments
  based
    these posts comparing the finishing on the gs compared to other comparable watches was quite interesting i think youll likely be quite confident in the gs after seeing them        
  based craigposter
make ridiculously expensive and accurate quartz watch  use the day/date mechanism from a shitter  i might need something with a 7813 movement as a donor but half of those on ebay are fucked too
  paying that much for that watch  kek  good for him though he saw theres a market for gullible seikofags and sure is working them
  listen here you jamoke that 9f gold quartz is stunning
  lol no
  wellthereyougo
  thats puppy is a 18k gold stunner worth every cent with that bulletproof 9f quartz movement way more convenient than the automatic for a dress watch
  what a faggot
  worthless like the amount of money youd get for the gold in that shitter
  now say uptake and mention off brand chips
  any casio with autoel option

  i have an 65 flat wrist and regular ocean one is already too big on my wrist due to the long lugs like  said consider getting a squale which has a better case design
what does /wt/ think of the laco flieger 39 type a can i use this watch as a dress watch
redpill me on the micro brand meme
  interesting designs that you wouldnt necessarily see from the big companies and at a decent enough price thats the idea anyway
  omg you think they would spend years developing a new calibre just to make it harder to service just kys
  scummy omega would totally not make a movement harder to service so you have to go to a specialized omega service instead of an independet watch service which is way cheaper    you dumb faggot have no idea of the real world
  wellthereyougo
    these posters are jamokes do not reply to them
  sarb is so cheap but it has a good design its like a very cheap gs
why must bangs be sectioned into a triangle like pic related
  also how far back should the apex go
  i made this post over 10 hours ago and not a single person replied mods if no one cares about my post just put me out of my misery
  theyre in a triangle because basic geometry im not sure what else to tell you
  why would sectioning your bangs into a rectangle semioval or semicircle not work  theyre in a triangle because basic geometry  if youre confident in your position surely you can elaborate on it
  what kind of cut do you want if you want them to lay nicely without product youre gonna want them like your picrel
  symmetry
  hair on top has to be longer than the front otherwise you end up with layers which will look terrible for bangs
  because if you pull too much hair from sides the sides youll end up with them going too far back and giving you a weird mullet youll also be cutting into your top layer of hair and instead of just having bangs youll have weird short peices that dont blend in with the rest of the length that and the reason its a triangle is because making it wider or different shapes make the hair fall in different places beside to the front of the face    op if youre asking this because you want   to cut your own bangs  please dont very few people who cut their own bangs make it work and the ones that do are usually professionals or at least have been doing it for awhile just go to a salon if if you dont have that much money go to your local beauty school and have an instructor do it or else youll end up like pic related
  im asking why that is the case
tfw you will never be able to go out into public carrying your sword and wearing your favorite kimono  i swear im neither a fat neckbeard nor a weeb yet every fiber of my being longs towards this aesthetic
claims not to be a weeb  every fiber of my being longs towards this aesthetic
  yeah i wish denim pants t shirt and tennis shoes werent the most common dress
  youre at a japanese bar and this guy slaps your geishas ass what do you do
  whos stopping you other than yourself
  basic social interaction also the law although i guess you could emulate the style now that i think about it would you require you though to walk around with an umbrella all the time
  pussy
just dress like modern samurai
  not doing kendo competitvely so you can travel with kimono and sword
  the modern samurai and a chinese man in a suit
  it is a shame that wetern clothing is being used all around the globe makes things boring   you have never seen a southeastasian using traditional clothes   every time i see the emperor wearing a suit i cry a bit
  my attempt to put together a samurai core outfit    white turtleneck is supposed to be worn under the black sweatshirt with the wide loose neck no idea if there is a name for it    combine with high waist wool pants if you need a belt choose a casual one    get a tube scarf and combine with fingerless wrist gloves color is ofc up to you    chose the boots because they fit with the scarf you can exchange the shoelaces too to fit with accessories or do whatever you want  in any case get a pair of boots that fit the outfit    techwear backpack and selfdefense umbrella as mandatory accessories
  forgot to mention the japanese jacket i believe this is called a hanten although this is probably exchangeable with some wool coat with the proper fit pic related
  /fa/ rate this
  where does one get a cool haori or pants like that
  pants       haori/hanten basically from japan or etsy
  bruh open carry of swords is totally legal in texas
  really cool
  since the pants are rly expensive  you might also be able to just buy any regular high waist wool pants and then use a black belly warmer as a sort of belt
  your geishas  they are the property of the bar
  lmao
  those boots  dropped  put some wooden sandals in there
  whats this type of jacket
  spoiler0288c_kywg96z1crlxxf2ic4raglgt/spoiler
  honestly some of this stuff is great but no way you can wear it all together without looking weird good picks though
  sure if youre gonna use that attitude
  but im european        not sure if sarcastic      for summer sure although walking around with those sort of sandals might be too much larp even for me i threw the pieces together for around late fall/winter      desu i think if you westernize the coat maybe choose another backpack and get some fingerless gloves that look rather subtle you can make it work without looking weird
      i found it here didnt cop
  i see these meme boots all the time what are they
  very expensive
you will never have honor
  in some european countries like germany youre not even allowed to carry wooden swords not joking btw

  the boots arent bad but she couldve picked something with a slimmer silhouette derby loafers sneakers etc    this is pretty good love that shirt pants i wish the boots were shorter though    replace with suicoke  get a sun hat
  masquerade violation
  /fa/ subconsciously hates this because her pristine hairline triggers them
  she looks like those kids from fury road lmao
  i am brown shoe  destroyer of fits
  what do brown shoes even pair with
  just about everything that isnt black or pastel
  tfw no small tiddy goth goblin gf
  tfw those are the only colors you wear
  demon
  cool hair pants are silly but can work the shoes ruin it
  plebbit  npcs  upboats  cringe
  what color should she have worn in this fit
  she would be effay if she was asian qt with perfect black hair   sometimes you just do not
  every blog on tumblr and any fashion subreddit that doesnt end on advice
    tfw i think these are the best fits all are bad tho
  yikes
  why do white girls look so disgusting nowadays
  she looks like a white femme obama
  its good except for the shoes the soles kinda mess the whole thing up
  her hairline is not perfect though
  im about 80 sure thats a tranner
  i just threw up      6/10 would hold her hand      disgusting      bad shoes not bad fit      no

  the boots are the worst part lmao
  standing on tip toe  why tho
  you know this stupid ugly bitch is looking in the mirror thinking shes the shit lmao
  this isnt even cringe im feelin it tbqh
  that lipstick never looks good on anyone no matter what skin tone or clothes they wear
  also a valued advice giver
  dont understand how she looked at this pic and still uploaded it without noticing
  that middle one is hilarious
    might work if she wasnt fat
  feel bad for her parents
  for real blue or purple lipstick is trash
  they wear it because men dont like it its like how dads wear socks and sandals because they dont give a fuckbut for some reason women havent figured out that their worth is based on their looks/ability to get a husband so it ends up coming off as ridiculous
  yes that is true for any outfit fashion exposed
blocks your path
  how tall is this goblin she is barely door knob height and shes wearing 10 inch pumps
  10 inch pumps
  i feel like this was a good concept but such poor execution and they probably cant even pull it off regardless
  i think you are just noticing that the shirt is great the riding books and colored skinny jeans cannot be saved to fix it youd have to completely change the silhouette and textures on her lower half     pic related the color on the cords is obviously off and not a fan of open toed shoes with winter fabrics but this in a better color green would be heaps better
try not to get too hysterical over women looking for advice on reddit /fa/    and never forget our girl
  the other rick poster has pretty much stopped posting but shes still a mod iirc
  fit would be decent with a different top maybe a mediumdark grey longsleeve
  so good
  are you living in 2004 or blind
    those shoes  the color of those shoes  visionerasing top  skirt pulled right off the rack of a thrift store    at least she has pockets
  le womens clothes have pockets meme    you realise that theres a reason womens clothing doesnt have functional pockets right imagine putting a phone in one of those pockets itd drag the skirt down pockets especially things in the pockets ruin the lines of womens clothing
  this the only reason womens clothes have pockets now is so they can pretend to be men
      that wasnt a compliment on her fit you retards lol
  oh fuck marry me wait im not good enough for this
  theres been a huge shift with the pockets thing because of modern feminism just 510 years ago women used to always complain that their husbands had a phone/wallet in the pocket of their slacks and it ruined their formal pictures now wedding dresses are being made with pockets as a selling point thats fine if its a well structured dress i guess but considering that bohemian/rustic dresses has been the forerunners in wedding dress trends recently it makes zero sense to put a giant phone in the pocket of a wispy free flowing skirt i think a lot of brides end up only putting lipstick and tissues in their wedding dress pockets because they realise that it looks terrible to have anything heavy in there great job at trying to be equals carrying around makeup and tissues because you cry a lot bravo girls
  replace the fugly shoe with a black pointed heel bootie and we are in business
  it makes your legs/the pants look better confused how youve never realised that heels make womens bodies look better lol
  thats a man
  im offended by everything     this thing needs putting out of its misery
this sub has heavy moderation  ooh that sounds fun    why are women like this ironically ffa is racist a f theyll cry cultural appropriation if you wear anything from free people i cant imagine asking someone for a cool place to hang out and responding positively to they have a lot of rules that are enforced randomly by a small minority of the people in charge
  adding on muacirclejerk isnt bad i think theyre quite funny at times its a pull/lolcow type of 4chan humor but with the usual female userbase
  whats the style of those boots called wouldnt mind them in black 3
  be cool if they had yellow stitching tbqh
  maybe but whats the style called anyways

is it gay to have fashion and fitness as my main hobbies  im a guy
  fashion  yes  fitness  no
the only gay hobby is fucking other men in the ass or being fucked in the ass or mouth by other men
  so im still straight as long as i only suck dick
  sucking dick is based and not gay  anyone can do it doesnt matter if you are guy or girl  can do it for your bros to relieve their stress they can do it for you too  good source of protein  tastes good
  fpbp  fashion as a hobby  purely indulging in vanity  fitness as a hobby  indulging in vanity but also active continued self improvement and indispensable part of a healthy adults lifestyle
looking good is considered gay now  brb getting fat and buying baggy jeans and shit
  does it actually taste good ive never tasted another mans cum only my own a few times on accident literally just tastes like mucus maybe i have a shit diet though
  i kiss my gf after cumming in her mouth and its kinda a sweet and salty taste i eat a lot of apples and raspberries
  ive never tasted another mans cum only my own a few times on accident  only my own a few times on accident  a few times on accident  on accident  haha
  who cares
  why be honest at first then bail out and lie anon  accident lol i have eaten my cum before not on accident lol who cares its your body
thoughts on the puma rs 100 ader i hate the chunky dad shoes trend but i really do fuck with these
cool shoe not best colourway but i like the shit on the back for sure
  the colorway is one of my favorite ever actually strange lol
  wearing puma
ogs were better
  love em capture the vintage aesthetic well with the colorway and manage to make a good chunky shoe without a ridiculous sole its a better integration of running diagnostic tools than the micropacer but i appreciate both     better in including functional tech but the updated styling is a plus
  this color blocking is really played out whole collab not even close to puma x hn kjobenhavn from last year
  those colors look like shit youre an actual moron
  this latest kjobenhavn collab is so shitty compared to fw17 and ss18
  cool but wtf is that autistic shit on the back
  in the original mid 80s puma rs computer the bump at the heel housed a sensor array with pedometer and a few other basic features ader wanted to keep the styling but obviously didnt need to include archaic tech in their shoe
  noice
    thats pretty neat  i still remember the nike sensor that connected to the ipod
  puma is doing the most interesting sneakers lately out of the mainstream brands adidas is pretty much dead in the water they cant come up with anything interesting since boost nike is trying and they do have a few interesting models but thats it new balance reebok and the rest doesnt worth a mention
  i agree puma doing interesting shit did you see they made sonic shoes    also i love them op
  i havent seen those until now that you mentioned it but the rsx toys have a few crazy colorways
  
if im browneyed and blonde should i choose silver or gray glasses
i honestly have no fucking clue also are you a girl ive never seen a blonde haired  brown eyed male in my life
  no im a boy  its more like dark blonde  i have to choose color today i tried the silver model and it looks awesome but theres also available grey model online and i dont want which one to choose
  i would prefer silver over grey anyway
  also because of you i found out that browneyed blonde guys are uncommon thanks
  i think the same is it also safer because i know how silver fits me and if i chose grey it could look bad
  its due to testosterone coloring hairs darker in general a lot of boys are born blonde but during puberty their hair turns brown or very dirty blonde meanwhile girls often dont change haircolor
bump
where can i find modern clothes like this it seems like guess sells some shirts similar to these but ringer shirts are pretty much dead         is something like this  too tryhard
yes
no
    i want a straight answer dammit
maybe

do earrings look good on men
if the question is does this look good / can this be pulled off that means its a nonconventional piece of attire / accessory so the only real answer is yes if youre already attractive and it goes with your aesthetic
is it 2000  no it isnt  so no
  what accessory for men is popular in current year
  not earrings
  an attractive face
  who gives a fuck if you want earrings get them
they can work depending on what you pair them with and the way you use them but they definitely arent in if you wear a lot of street wear and have some other jewelry to pair with it it can look good but i wouldnt recommend studs as a standalone piece or if youre wearing anything classier than a hoodie and some jeans       depends on your style but for the most part anything that goes on your wrist
  i think no matter how you look they compliment your face and add a little character to your look but you should wear only if you want toand not because someone told you so
on men  no  on peak beckham  yes
  everything looks good on him
  a watch and a watch only and even then if its only 10k else youll just embarrass yourself
why is every top made for boxy breastless asians stop making cute stuff that hangs off my tits like a tent reeeeee
every high fashion model is flat too  lose some weight
i fucking wish i had small tits high fashion works so much better that way
  im already thin hence the tent fashion industry is run by fags who dont like tits so everything is a box      i have to wear bras that lessen my boobs to look half decent in most things its all about ass now no tits allowed
  honestly true
  youre not a girl and you will never be a girl
i dont understand what you are referring to youll have to post a picture
  its all about ass now no tits allowed  maybe in yankland but not in normal places
womens clothing are always ugly desu
  if you feel the need to wear your outrageous opinions on your tshirt youre a pathetic faggot with no personality  inb4 t fat fuck  im skinny and this applies to both sides fuck of virtue signalling runtoids
thin flat chested asian girl  feels good
  how does it feel to only be able to date beta males though    just tuck in your shirt retard and stop wearing tshirts and start wearing shirts youll look less like a retarded teenager who just got breasts
  not always women just shop full fast fashion and trendhop so most of the time they look bad
  why is every top made for boxy breastless asians  im a dude but desu i never understood this about womens fashion either mens fashion either shows off a good physique or tries to hide a bad one so youd assume that womens fashion would either make your big tits look great or your small tits look big but instead you women all just torture yourselves and each other for some reason doesnt make sense to me
  its harder to emasculate men through fashion than it is to make women dress masculine      but seriously its just easier to makes clothes for men less curves and weird darts pretty standard hip sizes and less variation in body porportions
        posters    take this guy into account ill add to this as a bloke the best i can  the one common denominator i notice in womens fashion today is a sort of cognitive dissonance in utilising the female form to best net acclaim of course from a fashionable perspective youre wanting to outperform other women whilst simultaneously dressing your best to feel your best women often get the second and phone in the first   christina hendricks is unironically the one of the most fashionable women today because she understands the first wholly the timidity of women in leading from men forced into the working feminist age often follows extremes sexy is showing all your skin like a whore and business / career related although inappropriate in some areas such as the military and education making yourself look actually like a domineering man))) both extremes are unappealing the vast advantage you have with your large bosom arguably greater than a large ass as its closer to your face is that its truly foisted onto you without regard for others this is exactly how you should play it many women bizarrely reject their sexual endowment for whatever reason a common one is that many women are lead to believe that they do not actually possess their breasts as strange as it may sound hendricks makes no bones about it she has a fantastic sex appeal sex appeal that women can never remove and yet dresses with her endowment rather than around i think the main reason women downplay their own gifts is because they are surrounded with catty eyes my recommendation is to like hendricks did retreat at home for a good 13 months with little contact or move somewhere else and reappear unashamedly dressing without concern for your breasts i understand the negative attention but i can assure you its not worth a lifetime of selfcriticism for your body being the way it is your confidence will soar
  please post pics of your tents so i can pitch my tent
be woman  go shopping  literally every single top has a short length wide width with an extremely large obnoxious scoop neck  made with cheap thin materials  if i need cheap basic long sleeve shirts or sweatshirts i often buy mens extra small theyre usually cheaper than womens but much much better quality
  dont buy sweatshirts just buy knitwear youre not a teenager anymore
most women are fat in the united states the ones that arent usually dont have big boobs so thatd why almost no one makes clothes for the rare thin big boobed girl
  because modern fashion is heavily influenced by japanese designers  girls with big tits generally dont care about fashion  big tits are many things but they arent fashionable
are you expecting sympathy roastie cunt
my dick is hard
  binder
  big tits are many things but they arent fashionable    t never seen a single russ meyer film
  nice cope but im currently with a pretty boy twink who hits me when im bad
  pretty boy twink  so the definition of beta male
kys attention hoeing roastie
  hopefully next time he does it with a cricket bat so you stop posting shite
  why do you want to be hit  you are too far gone
  haha op has big tits try being a perfect c cup like me instead 
flat chested and big ass here its difficult to wear sweaters n shirts that drape over my ass it looks v odd and unflattering every body has its ups and downs all over slim is the easiest to style tho
  i completely agree with this big breasts are very attractive and in no way inherently unfashionable and you should say fuck everyone and dress to show them off also as a girl with a really big ass and relatively small breasts i wholly agree that having a big chest is still more of an advantage these days and generally considered more attractive and important than having a big ass think about this having a big ass has only started to be considered attractive by the mainstream in the past thirty or so years but having big breasts has been considered attractive for fucking ever women in the 50s literally wore bullet bras and extremely padded bras and bra inserts to achieve the shape that you have naturally pic related is what marilyn monroes tits actually looked like she just wore a bunch of bullshit to trick people into thinking she had huge tits

  im glad you see where im coming from exactly fuck them its akin to some fraternised meangirls attempt at hiding large breasts within groups to prevent them from being cool and confident with their bodies ie another product of women shitting on each other to be the best i find it really strange as a guy that this double standard exists with sexuality im a big guy and i choose to dress like a dandy and this irks sportsfan types often likewise with large breasts its tall poppy syndrome you have a desirable body or personality whatever that these people know they cant buy and want to cut you down to secure their own place  honestly the only people i see supporting these types of women not in dressing like whores but confidently are guys who dont see the bullshit other women see conversely i appreciate advice from chicks because you learn where compliments realistically lie     rule of thumb know what your positives are and then dress accordingly youre gonna piss people off like christina hendricks but these people would rather drag others down than take the time to accentuate themselves
actually also op kinda wanted to add that again as a girl with relatively small breasts whos spent a lot time being dysphoric about them and wishing they were bigger its started to really irritate me when i see girls with big boobs complaining about having big boobs from my perspective you might face minor inconveniences  back pain having men ogle them etc  but even with those its an absolute privilege to have big breasts having big breasts has been considered for the past 100 or so years one of the most important and attractive assets of womanhood ive seen a lot of posts on /tv/ and other boards saying stuff like why dont titlets just kill themselves lol a feeling youll never experience because you legitimately have the epitome of what modern american society considers an attractive female form and you just dont have much to complain about because its very very easy for you to make yourself attractive you can have a lowtier face and be an 8/10 because of big boobs its not even funny how much better it is to have big boobs than to have a big ass you should be on your knees thanking jesus for giving you big boobies none of this is an exaggeration
  this is why a lot of girls bully girls with bigger breasts out of envy im not implying thats what youre doing but equate having a small chest to being a short man you could spend your time trying to make the taller man look more unreasonable by pointing out character flaws or you can start focusing on making your character flaws less so the problem starts when you start denying that having large breasts or being taller is good ive met plenty of women who coast off of their instagram asses for example and are repugnant to be around most comedians understand this if you dont have certain qualities its up to you to develop others also just a reminder you can be drop dead gorgeous and be truly lonely on both sexes im not joking its sadly quite common to have no friends whilst having certain qualities give people the benefit of the doubt if they are nice enough also for some chicks its worse when theyre attractive because guys might not ever want to love them as more than a trophy same applies to chris hemsworth how many women do you know are interested in building a trainset with him for example
  caring about what the retards at /tv/ or 4chan in general think about breasts    larping big titty hoe detected    having a small chest is true femininity which is why most supermodels are chestlets
  i would never bully a girl for having big boobs and i wasnt trying to say i dont like girls with big boobs/wouldnt want to be friends with them or anything like that sorry if my post seemed to be insinuating that its more i meant that even with the little problems big breasts present i strongly doubt that most girls with bigger chests would trade them for smaller chests unless they were trying to be high fashion models or something nice digits btw    larping big titty hoe detected  certainly not but i wish
  having a small chest is true femininity  
  being attractive doesnt make you beta
  being attractive to other guys
  i doubt that too however some girls with smaller chests as i mentioned can be far more attractive by way of other things if desire is the end goal you are seeking your voice how you light up around other people your body language im a guy and i find body language way more attractive than just big tits unaccompanied by life think about how you would act in attracting people if everyone had no genitals

  ford sierra sedan 20i  volvo 940  bmw e28  all manual of course
  get an old grey rover with red decals

  new car    jetta  volvo  lincoln  kia      used  golf gti  bmw 1 series  thats it
  never buy a new car
  there are some great new models which have potential to became iconic but definitely not a volvo
  i meant more for the the financial aspect leasing a new car is such a mistake if you were to buy a new car for some insane reason though you should get some select european models or japanese makes
  lincoln  
  volvo is the only company that still has a competent design language in my opinion vw used to make good looking cars until this years facelift not that it even matters since new cars are designed to be disposed of after the lease period
  e30 over everything
      thanks brahs i think im gonna try to find a decent 19821992 e30  are bimmers as much of a nightmare to maintain  fix as everyone says or is this just non car fags projecting  t my car knowledge is limited to mostly jdm shit and i was looking at miatas before making this thread but felt they didnt fit me
  i own a newer bimmer e46 and its needed a tonne of work done to it my dad owned an old e30 before as a project car and he was always working on it somehow but it was going smoothly until one day it just stopped working entirely and he had to sell it since he didnt have the money to fix it i think the new owners fixed it tho tldr yeah theyre pains in the ass sometimes but theyre super cool and fun to drive worth it if you have mechanical skill and money to spend
  the fuck
    tfw owned a 840 for a year   engine blows
the car i got most compliments for from both petrolheads and just random passerbys was my old 2008 brera
  there are a ton of forums for e30 owners and fanbois most have lots of tips and fixes for common problems buyers guides too just google search it   be well informed before you buy regardless of brand any car over 20 years old can be a hit or miss proposition so many variables in the mix  buy the one in the best condition you can afford have a prepurchase inspection done by a specialist in the brand never buy blind never let emotion make a decision for you  good luck and godspeed anon may the bmw gods be on your side
  the only good thing about the grand prix car is that it looked good in posters

  from experience they really require regular maintenance more than any nip shit and things like elec arent the most reliable this wouldnt be an issue if parts werent so expensive tho
her measurements are 382944  ive been on a diet but i just realized that i would have the exact same measurements as her if i ditched the diet and gained like 1520 pounds do you think everyone looks better thin or that some people look better notthin
it depends highly on fat distribution two people with the same height and weight may have very different proportions
  you dont have to be skelly mode but its not like she would look bad if she lost weight shes just built a career around being a plus size model main thing is ratios
  id find her more attractive with less belly fat and more muscular legs but tastes are different
  only with a pretty face
yes some defiantly    iv seen fat people turn uglier after losing weight
no
  personally i like thicc bitches but in terms of fashion they are disgusting nothing beats a thinspo
yeah women if they have a good fat distribution men if they have wide hips fridge body can sometimes too as long as they are muscular of course
  how the fuck is that even possible
  i dont know but it should become the new standard
  waist trainer helps
i think people look their best when theyre skinny as long as theyre healthy or fit/athletic slightly underweight can still be okay though because clothes usually look good on you and i like the look personally i weigh 38 kg or 84 lbs but i need to gain some weight because im quite unhealthy right now even though im short im still pretty damn underweight i wish there were more ways of gaining weight that dont involve eating food
  her ass is very nonthicc for such a wide woman disappointing
  what ep is this gif from i forget
  her ass is actualy pretty huge
  shed look way better if she lost some weight her arms and legs look like meat tubes

can some please link a good inspo album
obligatory
  do your own research
            youre that dumb faggot that always talks shit about knoch because youre too dumb to actually understand what he is saying right
  whos knoch
  fuck off
  this guy he makes uniforms and tailored custom pieces i think op has been nagging him on instagram
  post real shit not this le fashy xddd hollywood garbage thanks
  post real shit  posts drawing     and a bad one at that volstad doesnt know shit
  feel free to post something better then friend
  im not sharing my stash with the likes of you chinaman
  your taste a shit
  taste    volstad cant correctly draw the details on those uniforms even if they were right in front of him his quality has dipped ever since he did the osprey books you dont know shit
i dont have lots of clear uniform photos but here are some relatively nice
  who the fuck cares stop posting vintage pictures     unless youre knoch none of that shit translates to actual wear    99 of /fa/ is high school teens who dont have the facilities to wear something like this
  shut up konuchu
  great in the know rebuttal fag    these threads are complete garbage and just a dump for the same twenty something meme pics every time
  arkan core best core
  bought one recently but it fits me like the dude in your pic it looks cool but weird at the same time
  go back to instagram wurst
  everybody who has an interest in ww2 is knoch    fuck off kid
  
  sage
  yeah the real ones run really big theyre meant to be worn over a full uniform and helmet which is why the hood is so ridiculous mine is a small and it fits just right even though im 61 200lbs the smalls are hard to find
        i fail to see what the point is of these pictures
i love milsurp its all i wear some days and today was payday so im going to go mad on milsurp sites any recommendations other than military 1st
  unfortunate
  i like varusteleka local stores are the best though imo
  can you explain to me what you get out of it
  kys do it for me
how can i wear camo and other surplus stuff without looking like im about to calling in an airstrike or shoot the place up
  inspiration
  nobody ever really wears camo for that reason  unless its something small like a hat or socks you dont want to look like dylan kleibold     olive drab stuff is the safe choice its a severely underrated color that goes well with black browns blue jeans or most shades of blue really just stick to one surplus piece per outfit
  what does that mean what does it inspire you to do do you dress like them do you speak or act like them do you share their believes and tastes
  a couple other points avoid stuff with a lot of extraneous military detailing like epaulettes graphic patches insignia excessive pockets go for the timeless designs field coats parkas commando sweaters bomber jackets button downs    always buy original vintage never modern repro stuff or clothes that are military inspired the remake stuff is always thinner lower quality and the details are off fake stuff screams trying too hard and youll end up looking like one of those shitty 70s draft dodgers
  to dress like them you ass nugget
  okay can you show me how you dress then id like to see the product of said inspiration
  ive seen two grandpas wearing camo jackets today its everywhere if there is a time where even the meakest of creatures can dare to upgrade his camouflage jockstrap to a pair of pants its now
  i dont self post but thank you for your genuine interest
  you can cut out your face im just interested in how you would create something from this inspo
  im all for it mate but proceed with caution
  depends on the repro some of it is better than the original pockets are fine imo and epaulets can be removed       burgundy/reds are also a good match
  good look      shut it faggot
    yeah tell me about it i picked up a medium because i couldnt pass up a price of 12 euro liner and hood included i look like a liam gallagher wannabe at 6 150lbs when i wear it but so be it
  basically daddymilsurp    he was a tripfag here but doesnt come around really anymore
  stop having fun
  its not fun to just post pictures and no fits    its fucking gay
  i hate this phrase  more like stop wallowing in your own shit and acting like its chocolate
  exactly i hate threads like this or any inspo dump its always the same old shit and nobody actually wears any of it or is capable of coming up with something thats actually inspired by it either
posting ww2 stuff is cool im quite a fan myself however with no way to procure these items in nonchinkrepro quality i fail to see the point
  waaah waaah but its inspiration it doesnt have to be the real items i just look at pictures of nazi soldiers and it made me more fashionable because i dont like jews now waah
  i mean it is entirely possible to get into the aesthetic its just damned difficult unless youre best buds with a tailor who specializes in alpine hunting gear/supplies reenactors or happen to stumble upon a shop thats eluded all of the guys here the chances are slim
  not sure if this counts but whatever theyre my favourite pair of trousers copped for five bucks to the fags here who dont get milspo one reason is because surplus is often comfy durable and cheap plus it looks better
  ideal gf style
  i like this picture anon
  what military are these  i passed up a pair of austrian od trousers for 5 euros over summer that im still kicking myself over
  its the comfy look swedish m90 is a good contender if youre on a budget
  if youre talking swedish comfycore the m1909 is the only answer
jerking to nazis is gay
best milspo out there
    thought as much of course you wouldnt be able to provide anything      this is your best fit yet shame its unwearable unless its actually freezing outside
  weird my goal aesthetic is depressed draft dodger core
  true
  i know this is practically a meme at this point but hemming the pants by doing it yourself or getting it tailored will make them look 10x better its a bit more expensive that you think to have something tailored but its pretty easy to do with a sewing machine and your own materials   anyways im dumping some female milspo
  why are you so entitled to other peoples personal photos and what have you provided        are you guys not capable of abstraction unless youre posting pictures from memes list which is only vaguely interesting for the hair styling there is so much to take from these pictures parkas smocks pant fits scarves layering patterns silhouettes sometimes colours if all of that isnt apparent to you you can always ask knoch to make you a street approved casual version of the literal uniform pieces
  you talk the talk but do you walk the walk
  you are not giving any proof of yourself being capable of being able to abstract anything from those photos which is why im asking you to do so
    no u
  great comeback really mature i dont dress in military surplus so a fit by me would be of no worth im interested in your process of abstracting something from these world war 2 photographs of german soldiers post a pic
  this is the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me on here aaaaa
  us military  aw i hate that feeling where i used to live there was this huge milsurp shop where the entire basement was filled with stuff it was so much fun to go through i miss it a lot desu
  thanks for the advice usually i wear them cuffed at least not sure why i didnt that day the edges are definitely a bit ragged so hemming them is a good idea
  i have an n3b parka from a relative who was in the air force stationed in alaska during the korean war its massive but you have to embrace it
    thanks  diving into a pile a random surp is the best my local second hand shop used to have a ton of milsurp that nobody cared about and thus hung around till sales there was a time where i managed to scoop up a lot of rare patterns but the stream has long since dried up
  they look like they fit well    this isnt even a suggestion to that outfit but if you find a pair of trousers that are slightly oversized or that the belt cinches the fabric installing bachelor buttons and getting a pair of surplus military suspenders is a decent looking alternative x brace is stronger than y though y is more classic looking i went through a whole ordeal with it because of stiff leather and worn out elastic ripping buttons so take heed to a not busted suspender
  ive been on the hunt for braces like that for ages they look so beautiful to me on both men and women far superior to belts too id love to find a pair and wouldnt mind adding the necessary buttons in the least have any photos care to share
  is this actually a girl in the milspo threads
  theres been others there was that one girl who had the gorka anorak and another one who i think was asking about wool coats
  im actually surprised that there have been others  as a girl i can see how it could be pretty intimidating to post in these threads even though they are my favourite
  get a pair of wehrmacht knockoffs the czechs issued during the cold war theyre cheap classic and somewhat different to standard leather buckled heritageish suspenders
  good memory on you
not military but definitely political 
  took these quick and dirty i used the pants for work over the summer had to dig them out of my closet
anyone know of boots similar to this
  
  looks great
  danke   i recommend looking towards varusteleka or swisslink for suspenders
  how can i wear overalls like this without looking autistic im 64 215 llbs for reference btw w2c turtleneck like that
  i mean suspenders how can i not look like a hipster fag or onions
  s0yb0y not onions kys censor
  i am       these outfits play with milspo but the primary vibe i am digging for these styles is interwar european this gets into all sorts of fashion depending on what ethnic hodgepodge influence you invoke typically english / french / german with a further influence from veteran fisherman and farmer  i am one seasonally occupational styles    regardless hemmed / cuffed to the point of not baggy single break or no break pants with a straight fit high waisted looser vintage fits khakis corduroys wool flannel pants milsurp offers a good chunk etc can be worn with it     you want to be reasonably muscular carry yourself reasonably well not fall into typical traits that frail metro men succumb to while trying to try to create a veil of rawer more noble masculinity    ribbed waffle fisherman rollneck or any chunky sweater can be worn with them thick shert jackets work as well everything tucked in but suspenders can be worn underneath they layer like any other piece    you need thick button in suspenders not the skinny tie equivalent that clips on you want to avoid looking like that pseudo hypebeast or chunky americana emulator at senior prom this entails getting bachelor buttons rivet clamped / tacked in sewing your own buttons in or getting a tailor to do it     for suspenders see            ive worn some pretty autistic outfits last week i wore gorka pants with their own suspender system with a white rollneck and an oktoberfest hat i got a bunch of comments on going fly fishing but a lot of people respect unique style if you display it confidently it looks like it fits you 1 and you appear to put in thought to your outfits    hell i wore puttees throughout the winter last year when the snow was bad i got a lot of compliments on those as well because they do taper in a way that seems appropriate and still vintagely styled    dunkirk inspired me to get big into turtlenecks
    also turtlenecks are hard to get as a milsurp item and im sure if you did find some the wool would be very irritating and coarse that sweater is from f/w 2017 uniqlo u but the composition is too high on polyester for most peoples liking including my own 55/45 poly/wool but the color was great and it was on clearance and its not terrible    i would recommend thriving where possible ebay is great etsy as well grailed/depop i dont use for sweaters vintage sweaters add to the look     i would recommend looking at these places for good new sweaters         typical ll bean / jcrew / rei / other online retailer options    feel free to try to find any of these secondhand as well
  shit thanks my guy for the help
any nazbol warcore
  oh my god dude shut the fuck up and let the guy post photos he likes jesus christ why do you care
  jesus christ shut the fuck up    /fa/ is dead    no fits no nothing just high school teens posting the same shit ad nauseam
  puttees    i wish i could pull those off like u anon
  is ah cropped into that photo p
  lies hes totally here  in this thread he cant stay away from telling people what theyre wrong about    post a historical picture and say something grossly indecent  inaccurate and he is the anon who corrects you i promise
  actually that would be me and im not knoch
  sounds like a great service if true
  magical
  semi  agree it is good      i just picked up a sanitized buckle like that except russian  gonna pair it with a ww1 us overcoat pic incoming
  thats a strafbattalion buckle not a sanitized one they were made like that for penal units        inb4 are u knoch     no i asked him about it
where do i get nice leather gloves for cheap       what does snow have to do with puttees those things are just ankle support
    sanitized as in made without insignia for foreign operations    you know clandestine    unless you can find a source
  the strafbattalion buckles were made without insignia for other reasons youd know very well these guys were still wehrmacht
  
brotip penal battalion buckles are a myth guys in those units wore standard army ones generic/sanitized versions of the archetypal german buckle were and still are produced for civvie use
  dude just get the fuck out of the thread if youre not going to participate to the context of the thread youre embarrassing yourself
  untrue berg und nolte 1943 produced and marked do exist what youre thinking about are the blank hj/dj ones but those are aluminum in material not painted steel
  this is a postwar buckle manufactured in russia between 1970 and 1990 its not german    were talking about different things here my friend
    oh also the civilian ones are chrome pot metal you can buy those for your firefighter uniform
  snuffkinnnnnnn
  im not talking about your buckle i just remembered knoch saying something or other about strafbattalion buckles maybe i misremember maybe he said its not
  see now i wasnt talking about knochos buckle i was talking about mine
      i thought all of these were the same person talking about mine sorry
  yours is russian so why would i call it strafbattalion
  based care to post a fit
    i like this guys take on casual milsurp he usually wears classic menswear but sometimes mixes in military pants and jackets with his shirts and ties
      pug face south east asian
  whats wrong with his feet
  strafbattallion is a russian word that the germans coopted    strafnik
  yes once everything arrives will be wearing with jackboots
  its the other way round
  
  bestrafen is german for to punish the german words are coopted by the russians
  those pants are dope    what jackboots did you get
  the words are german not russian
      this punishment is strafe in german
  in his order stalin also mentioned hitlers successful use of penal battalions known as strafbataillone as a means to ensure obedience among regular wehrmacht units    the russians coopted this system from the germans hence the loan word name
            aha oops  i have major firsttimelearning bias i learned about the russian component long before the german and always thought it was the original    my bad
  customs from the land abroad koutny made    aaand i may have outed myself if the originator of the boots is here incognito
  did you buy them from knoch i wasn interested in those but i wear a 44
  if pic related is you that is a gorgeous pair of trousers perfect in every way desu
  i got them secondhand   they will be arriving one day soon im very excited and will share when i get them
  do you know what he thinks about berger im unsure if i should go with him or koutny
  both have ups and downs    long and short of it    both  spotty communication and little patience  saying the wrong thing could result in dismissal of your case    koutny  professional shoemaker makes more comfortable shoes at the expense of historical accuracy not a big deal if youre not a stitch nazi and his boots look better fashionably speaking    berger  hobbyist but more accurate to the historical patterns  stitching is sometimes sloppy but the results are always nice    ymmv
  post real shit  follows with that pic  yikes
  angloshit p49 is still relatively cheap and pretty good i wear them around alot to fuck around with trying really hard to find m/39 swedish wool trousers that havent been given the m/52 or m/58 update maybe i should just give up and go knoch with custom repro jerryshit     ones in the pic are danish army trousers
  based panasian cloth face ns man
  now i need to get suspenders going to get buttons on the inside tho
  please tell me thats not an ancom flag in the right corner
  damn i dont want to wait that long but saving on jacks doesnt really seem like an option even if theyre in the 200 dollar range
  spoonfeed me on this 50s update
  in the late 1950s existing m/39 uniforms were modernized resulting in the m3958  jackets had their back vents sewn shut shoulder straps removed rear pockets added and armpits reenforced with strong canvas  trousers were fitted with adjustable cuffs which eliminated the need for gaiters and cargo pockets    the swedes did a very thorough job because the vast majority of m/39 you find on the surplus market have been converted to 58 specs   uniforms in the original 1939 configuration are something of a rarity and usually command a higher price
  the puttees insulate better in 2 ft of snow also keeps some water out i did wear them in other instances but there were an always for snow
also dug the furys style
  i guess ive got something in the vein of this guy i managed to get a few usmc uniform shirts mainly because i like the collar and ive been trying to pair them with various sweaters for something that looks good nothing else in the fit is anything too special though im looking to get better boots
  fucking hell this board is an absolute pisstake
  tuck the collar in
  they look great desu i bought a pair and thought they looked shit on me and the wool was very course compared to my other wool army trousers besides they dont come with buttons for suspenders
  dont tug the collar in lose the tshirt
  hey are these the suspenders youre talking about im trying to cop a pair of suspenders but idk which ones to get  
  could i get a thing like that tailored to be form fitting for thin waist and shorter arms or is the material too thick
        nice fits anon
any recommendations for black leather milsurp boots that come in womens sizes i have a thicker shaped pair but i want a slim pair too
its easy guys just wear something
  and then post it of course
will people laugh at me for wearing a trench coat
  do you care are you confident enough are you older than 25 are you good looking do you have a personality that fits your sense of dress do you live in a flyover state do you live in any of the americas does your lifestyle permit it     do some checks to spare you the shame
  gorgeous
  haha how was someone that fat in 1930s this is real
  m39    do you mean this version i think knoch has a few of them there was another picture of him wearing these bloused into corcoran boots with a backpack iirc
  found it
bump
    fairly certain those are danish judging from the inwardfacing pleats and the dickiesstyle covered belt loop tunnel things    i think pic related are unmodded swedish ww2 pic ripped from ebay
  nay im talking about pic related you can find them on ebay a lot of the times theyre posted as something along the lines of german war suspenders czech army as if theyve been personally plucked of some wehrmacht schmucks breeches
  no  it has actual sheepskin for a liner you buy it if you can and you wear it as is get a cosplay remake if you plan on butchering it
  those are post war production but made on the same machines as the wehrmacht ones they still have the extra lang buckles sometimes real wehrmacht ones look exactly the same as those but with grey and not green color or sometimes completely white
  you cant prove thats him the face is blurd
  background seem familiar     idiot
bump
  triggered by a joke sensitive
we need more warcore in /fa/ im so sick and tired of these faggy techwear fits stop being a weak little bitch and dress like a man you dumb fucking coward if you wear chelseas or any other gay stuff like that then you deserve to be hung by the neck until dead

sleazecore cringe thread
thats not that bad sleazecore is a dumb thing to aspire to though the genre is cringe itself if youre trying to do it you obviously cant pull it off
sleazecore  cringe  pick one
  nice imagine of rick smiling    cheers  a    sent from my iphone
  if youre trying to do it you obviously cant pull it off  this is very true sleaze has to manifest itself naturally
  thats not that bad    it can definitely be a lot better
all sleazecore is cringe
last year i correctly predicted that sleaze would be huge this year but i couldnt have predicted that it would end up being so cringe  glad i didnt fall for the meme
cringe sleazcore is just good serial killer core
  can you show us an example of it being better then
  definitely a cop
  agreed the try hards look like son of sam
hawaiin shirts were the best example of how trends work for me  no one would give two thoughts about wearing one then boom go to the bar and every single loser fuckboy is wearing a hawaiin shirt like dont you feel like a robotic idiot only wearing something once it becomes this huge trend i hate normies

  i thought they were still popular what happened
i hate this brand with a passion ever since i saw a refugee in cheap monday jeans and a fucking cheap monday tee with their fucking logo on it

  lol i wear jeans with elastane and your comment triggered the fuck out of me only because i can picture the kind of pompous cunt you are irl    with that being said cheap monday deserve to die
cheap monday had /fa/ by the balls back in 20132014 when everyone wanted a bayani or bart parka
i used to like the minimalist parkas they put out every autumn but the design has really gone downhill look at this shiny abomination
    bayani was from aw2012
  yes but people were still spamming about it in w2c nonetheless
  this looks disgusting

  this thread will die because you didnt write boot general
recommend me chelseas

  dude just get some respectable boots like aldens or red wings
  fuck fuck fuck fuck     oh well someone just make a new one when that happens

service boot black chromexcel
  chromexcel sucks its the biggest meme one can fall for
just copped a pair of these r8 and h8
copped these on black friday  howd i do
  you done fucked up probably coulda got 1 decent pair of boots for the amount you spent on those
can i wear gray wool pants with black nike sfbs i usually just wear dickies
  the 6 variety honestly any pant recs would be cool i always see shia and other sfb wearers tucking the pants into the boot but im not sure if i like that i tend to wear baggier stuff but im willing to give it a try i dress very similar to shia and wear a lot of working/outdoor brands like carhartt karhu patagonia mountain hardware and outdoor research i work for the forest service so i get a decent discount on these sort of brands
  i really hate this style and have never understood its popularity monkstraps too wildly popular shit that does nothing for me  ive tried to like it because theyre one of the few styles semiregularly available on the only last comfortable for me trubalance  is that natural chromexcel  what last    if i had to get one itd be the darker shell models so i wouldnt have to notice that weird front stitch so readily  if someone gave me a light pair similar to yours i couldnt wait for the natty cxl to darken with age and get a bit more beat up  so i hate them but you seem to like them like so many people whore into tankers or norwegian split toe  post another pic one day when you get some wear into them id be curious to see how they turn out
  shitty chromexcel sucks  unfortunately thats usually whats available because manufacturers skimp on quality at the clickers table  its funny what every shitty new americana or wearwear inspired kickstarter bootlet startup makes a big fuss about it in their marketing theyre usually the ones that use the shittiest cuts available  its not something that you should pay a premium for as most of the time itll be shit unless you buy from a brand that doesnt skimp which is rare and even then sometimes shitty cxl slips through the cracks  you know what maybe youre right cxl probably is a shitty meme  ive just been lucky enough to to have any of the usual problems associated with it in the pairs i have it on  i like how it stretches the fuck out during wear though gives my fucking feet some leeway in fit
damn speaking of nike fsbs i dont need boots but ive been wanting a pair of these forever somebody help me pull the trigger this or some danner tachyons    left looks nice right why
  norwegian split toes are a lovehate type of shoe there doesnt seem to be a middle ground i like them because theyre different from mocs and theyre not that common they work well as a casual boot and on the right last without contrast stitching you could probably get away with wearing them with a suit  they are natural cxl in the trubalance last i have the same model in suede my color 8 shell version is supposed to come in next year i need a calfskin to complete the set of each leather and then maybe some indy pacs for the hell of it rumor is there maybe a run in the whiskey colored shell in the next year or 2  pic related is after they darken up and get some age      biggest issue with cxl is people dont take proper care of it they think since its an oiled leather they can just leave it be or they try using regular polish with cxl you have to have shoe trees or it will look like shit and use mink oil or coconut oil every regularly regardless calf skin will always be superior to it
  some quality opinions posted in this thread on a variety of topics ive a pair of trumans and another on the way fingers crossed  in my experience cxl varies but then so does full grain leather which is kind of the point cxl relates to the broader tanning process done on what is assumed to be quality leather to begin with   the leather itself can be of poor quality  the cxl process may be poorly done  the boots can still be poorly made  if what people really think cxl guarantees is a beautiful well chosen piece of full grain oil infused pull up leather that will require little maintenance and age handsomely then they may be disappointed   if by cxl the consumer understands that in the tanning process some metallic compounds were employed then thats probably more on point   make sense to anyone else
black viberg or brown
    definitely the brown ones
anyone had a custom oneoff pair of boots made
short boots with rolled pants legs  shiggy diggy
just got some factory second 1907s for 130 shipped howd i do
  if i didnt recoil when i saw moc toe boots id say well done anything noticeably wrong with them
  havent received them in the mail yet they said i could take them back to nordstrom rack if i dont like em i dig the moc toe good enough for mcqueen good enough for me
  these are fine they are definitely that boot going for that look which everybody very clearly understands getting them on sale and as seconds is fully in line with that whole thing youre going for    you are probably sitting around in a henley and faded jeans right now and you have the complete outfit great     at least you didnt get suede chelsea boots but im guessing you may already have those or your best friend already has these instead so you got them as well it is fine but then you probably already know that these are fine      all black boots and soles with antique copper eyelets viberg you were so close
  these are fine  ayy alright i didnt really have a plan i just dont have any boots and these looked versatile i also read they were classic and that red wings held up well the price just sealed the deal i do not own nor do i plan to own any suede boots thanks for the input anon
  fine  but also    they arent versatile either     this is really what red wing is all about i dont really know what i want but i want everything to be alright and muh heritage and working class guys will accept me but im also a smart sensitive bryan goslings that drives and scores poon but i wear jeans every day and even though i am 100 a product of the popular moment i want to be a timeless taste guy and are beards still cool
  i am unironically okay being that guy it requires very little thought and effort nor does it break the bank and with this style the harvestable poon is abundant cheers
  well said and you could roll far far worse so good luck enjoy those boots for a couple seasons and then have another look at other boots youll learn quite a lot from the experience

hermit musician edition
i got pic related berghaus jacket im probably one of the only 5 people in this country that own one of these beaties here now
  i have never seen a single person wearing anything with this logo in europe
  good i honestly never got the appeal of this brand over here its mostly a frat brand you see them wearing longsleeves with a giant whale on the back
  he hasnt taken the vinepill
  amerifag i am an amerifag and ive always wanted to get a berghaus fleece jacket the only reason i dont get 1 of their shell jackets or windbreakers is because the logo isnt stitched on im afraid of spending a lot of money on the jacket just for the berghaus logo to peel off after several wears    with that being said if i dont see ellesse being worn that often in europe i probably wont see it at all anywhere else i only see european tourists wear it and im probably 1 of a handful of amerifags that knows about the brand let alone wears their stuff
  being worn that often in new york city
  its just a slightly more flashy prep brand lacoste and other brands rape it in every way
  logo isnt stitched on  i dont know that much about berghauss other jackets but jackets logo is literally a small rectangular patch stitched onto the front shouldnt worry about that    ellesse is not that popular here but a lot of people in europe wear it their tracksuits are quite nice and i have a t shirt from them
how can i find jeans that fit like this very specifically

as someone who has a topknot is the only hat that i can wear basically ancient chinese hats because they have extensions for the bun to fit in
nonsense any hat like this a sombrero or of the ten gallon variety would accommodate your hairs
yes  this is your punishment for having such a terrible hairstyle   take the buzzpill
is there some force preventing you from untying the bun and then wearing any hat you want

this isnt nomaly my tipe of dressin i wanted to try something new
do people in france really have a better dress sense    
  i watched this video a while ago and it just made me feel sick because they all dress so shitty and look filthy and like they smell bad i do not want to watch it again art students are fucked up and ironically not fashionable at all
im working toward a french aesthetic to me that means minimal clothing basic timeless comfortable im also very sparse with my makeup i dont think the stereotype would exist without some truth behind it but those people in the video look annoying
  tfw no french accent asian gf
  chink art student with no eyebrows half heartedly reading a jeff koons book  what a walking meme

sup guys after getting /fit/ most of my clothes are illfitting and baggy i read the sticky and am a bit confused because it focused more on quality than style what is the benefit of upgrading my clothes from walmart jeans hanes white cotton tee shirt and cheap sunglasses to higher quality garments that look similar since i could not afford to upgrade all of my wardrobe in one go what do you think would give me the best bang for my buck if i bought it peacemeal or should i consider doing a different style since im essentially a new person now
  does dakota have some home grown high quality chicken without parasites or is she just dumb as fuck
  dumb as fuck fortunately for her shell lose a ton of weight when that gets her sick
  look for inspo outside of fashion boards besides some tips here and there the only way to achieve effaynes is to cultivate it
    nah this was just some woman successfully trolling facebook
  please go back to /fit/ we have too many of you incels from /fit/ ruining this already garbage board just wear tight white shirts and black jeans
  women shouldnt try to troll we just assume theyre stupid
  by chance how tall are you you sound like youre  6ft
  doesnt that just mean you were successfully trolled
  i mean my default response to a chick doing a stupid thing is yep seems about right  if that means i was trolled because she was intentionally acting dumb then yep i was trolled
what is the benefit of upgrading my clothes from walmart jeans hanes white cotton tee shirt and cheap sunglasses to higher quality garments that look similar     they dont look similar and you cant see that because your taste is underdeveloped      what do you think would give me the best bang for my buck if i bought it sic peacemeal    buy some toptier jeans that fit you well dont be afraid to drop around 200 or 100 used on grailed maybe jeans are extra high bang for buck because you can wear them with anything and almost every day and theyll last for a long time and you can definitely see where the extra money went vs wallmart jeans i recommend momotaro going to battle tight straight or apc new standard dont fall for the skinny jean meme    in terms of bang for buck as investment pieces    jeans  outwear  shoes  sweaters  shirts
  they dont look similar and you cant see that because your taste is underdeveloped  thats actually quite incisive do you really not have to wash jeans if you wear them every day or is that just a meme and do people have a lot of clothes at this price point im just thinking that i have like 10 pairs of jeans but theyre all pretty cheap so if i replaced everything it would be a fortune unless you can get multiple uses from a shirt or something
  im too dumb to tell satire
  im 61    the state of /fit/ incels
  do you really not have to wash jeans if you wear them every day or is that just a meme    you dont need to wash jeans unless they get dirty or start to smell raw denim people sometimes wear jeans for two years without washing them its usually just not a problem ive work my jeans more or less every day for 8 months and theyre fine    and do people have a lot of clothes at this price point    stuff at that price point and up is occasional investment tier unless youre a richfag    grailed is nice for cheap designer clothing but you cant easily return clothes you buy there so its best for stuff thats forgiving with fit like sweaters and outwear    muji has great cheap basics ascolour has outstanding quality cheap ts
upgrading cottons  generally nothing beside smooth and expensive cotton give you sense of inflated ego    upgrading sunglasses  cool sunglasses are expensive and too badly made sunglasses are bad to your eyes    best bang for a buck  wear cheap clothes and buy a watch
if i asked you how to get /fit/ you would say ss and gomad and to lurk  lurk here instead of asking to be spoonfed faggot
  hur dur i was only pretending to be retarded
  i would tell you to read the sticky before asking questions which i did       thanks for all the help      i think im gonna upgrade   jeans  sunglasses  shirts  do you feel like you get a lot of value out of wearing watches i dont wear suits
  we  speak for yourself autist
  sup  quit reader right there
  you didnt read the sticky clearly and if you actually ask questions like  what is the benefit of upgrading my clothes from walmart jeans hanes white cotton tee shirt and cheap sunglasses to higher quality garments that look similar    then you clearly need to lurk more
  the sticky only talked about various qualities of clothes without mentioning why that matters its not obvious to someone whos not a /fa/ggot why spending 50 on a tee shirt is better than 5 because saying that the material is different or made in a different process does not actually answer the question fucking neck yourself i dont need to lurk on a board if they dont answer basic questions in a sticky
  youre right anon you figured out something that nobody else has thought about walmart shirts and jeans are cheap and exactly as good and look just as good as more expensive brands keep buying and wearing those and laugh at all the dummies who dont know any better everyone else is totally oblivious
  you know the material is different blah blah but you dont know the reason to buy clothes x5 expensive than walmart if you dont have the need to buy dont buy them    if you really want to know why go university to learn sociology why people dont want to buy clothes on walmart not ask a congolese anime drawing board
  are you a retard  the quality is what matters you retard and quality is an amalgamation of fabric cut style and design you brain dead piece of shit  fuck off my board you dumb cunt
i dont want to fuck this up bought unsanforized raw denims and theyre fucking huge i sized up to a 32 from a 30     ill also need to cut the inseam because its way too long    so the soak process is pretty much wearing it in the bath tub with cold water for 30minutes and then hanging it out to dry is it okay to dry it out in the bathtub    afterwards do i just take it to a tailor to get the inseam cut    please tell me what to do guys i really dont wanna fuck this up
lol why did you size up
  so the soak process is pretty much wearing it in the bath tub with cold water for 30minutes and then hanging it out to dry is it okay to dry it out in the bathtub    your process is right but denim typically shrinks up to one inch and after some wear stretches back  assuming youre filling in your pants waistline is something you cant get tailored so if theyre comically big or you dont plan to get fat  exchange them    yes you can dry your jeans anywhere i would pref do mines outside since the dye would drip and if done inside involves more cleaning    inseam is up to your discretion but raw denim fags typically want stacks i find it more appeasing on the skinnier or slim cuts
  unsanforized dude    yeah i was checking some guide and it said post soak shrank to my waist size    im planning on inseaming to 32 since i have short legs and do a single stack
  grave mistake you shouldve stayed on 30 used them for a month or two so they break in and then you wash them on a tub   its way better to go tight than loose also  inseaming  dont
  it is true that it will shrink to your size but after some wear ie youre moving around shifting your weight  it will stretch the waistline to at most 32 this is unavoidable    t owned over 6 pairs of raw denim
  you already fucked up dude
tumble dry makes clothes small
  sizing up    its too late youve already fucked this up yes they shrink when washed for the first time but they idea is to buy tight have them stretch which they will wash them and then theyll shrink back to the tight size you bought them then they just stretch again back to comfy and there you go perfect jeans     sizing up is a mistake as theyll shrink but just stretch back to being too big
i was looking at that exact pair yesterday the postsoak measurements are fucking small  31 for a tag size 34 something sounds messed up on your end with your idea of what size you are or maybe their postsoak measurements are extremely aggressive/taken after exposure to volcanic conditions
i have several nf jeans and they suck     i rather have 1 pair ofpbj instead of 3 nf
yall think i can still return them   i opened the packaging but i didnt wear them or soak them yet
unsanforized  ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
ok if i am never to button the last button of my suit why do they include it just remove it   problem solved who are these morons running the suit industry
  comes from when the king of england was too fat to button the last button on his jacket so he left it undone his courtiers followed suit pun intended by leaving theres undone turning it into a fashionable thing to do adlnd the done thing at court rather than being because the king was a fat fuck
its so the initiated may easily distinguish themselves from the plebeians whom  not being in the know  may sometimes button the last button so conveniently placed there for them thus revealing their ignorance
    the history is cool but looks bad sloppy it should go away
  they have one button jackets dude it looks really bad
  i think all the nonsense with buttons and lapels and ties are silly so i am going nehru jackets
  when you hang your suit you button the last button so so your suit doesnt stretch when your not wearing it    if it was because of king edward why didnt he simply get his presumably bespoke suit to be tailored for his girth also people buttoned the bottom button decades after his deathand he buttoned the bottom button
  its tradition and if theres any place where tradition is appropriate its in formal dress so either deal with it or go buy yourself an untuckit shirt and call it a day    its also useful for separating retards like youwho cannot wrap their heads around something so simplefrom the rest of us
you can button the bottom button but suits arent cut to accommodate that so it fucks up your silhouette you absolutely can get a suit tailored for the bottom button to close and it not look like shit but be prepared for a lot of people who only know the reductive rule of sometimes always never to want to correct you    unless youre commissioning such a suit for a conversation piece dont bother it is incredibly rude to trap people like that and will make you come off like a complete tosser
  button what you like as it looks good or not  also  not every item in clothing is functional so get fucked if you expect otherwise
its aesthetic
  nehru  have to get that shit tailored properly by someone who knows what theyre doing those have to be well fitted otherwise its fucking shit  a friend had one made recently and had way more fittings than he usually has needed in the past for western suits  well its either the nehru or whatever it is the chinese wear i forget the specifics
hey /fa/ any advice on how to grow out my buzzcut without looking like shit there must be something but wearing a hat for several months
  if you mean grow your hair out long theres nothing you can do its going to look awkward and dumb for months after it starts to cover your ears everyone goes through it
  its called keeping the buzz or timing it for the winter where you can wear hats/beanies
  doesnt have to be long just a decent cut for the adult male and all that
  well its winter here now guess i have to make my choice
  if its already winter its too late keep it     post a pic tho of your face
wearing a hat is the only option really im growing out an undercut and i dont leave the house without a lid on because my hair is fucked 7 ways to sunday for the next 5 months or so until it grows back out
  i dont see what the problem is unless youre asian and have the short spiky hair problem just let it grow and dont do anything
are apc new/new petit standard still the best midtier raw denim    im starting a working class job and walk to wear workwear looks
i still buy them after all these years but you can usually find them cheap on ebay    dont fall for the sizing down meme probably why there are a lot of them on the used market just buy the size where once you button them up it will fit how you normally would itll stretch a little for a bit of extra comfort    but ffs dont fall for the retard shit i used to read about people buying them so they cant button up the last button or two when they get it because they expect it to stretch
  solid advice here i wasted so much money falling for that meme went through about 3 pairs until i just said fuck it and bought the size that fit my seat area and thighs correctly they never stretched all that much     i usually buy my apcs on grailed now i like them worn in you get all the perks of cool fades without putting the work in
  how do people stand wearing raw denims with lightcolored sneakers    do they just stop acting like raw jeans after a few washes or something
  they cuff their jeans its no coincidence that the rise of cuffing jeans in internet fit pics coincidenced with everybody and their mother recommending apc ps
  id personally just go with the size that measures to 1 inch smaller than your waist they do stretch but not at all as much as other brands who will sometimes stretch like 2 inches
dont buy petit new standard its too skinny petit standard at most
  lol
im a fan of new standards personally ive had my pair since around 2007 i never got them hemmed and dont like the look of cuffing anymore so i rarely wear them  feel like itd look weird if i hemmed them now with the fades so id recommend getting them hemmed at the ankle as soon as you get them
i find the fades on other midtier raw denim look more cartoonish on stuff like naked and famous everyone watned those fades in 2013 and maybe the jean makers made the pants to get too faded lol is that even possible
  
  the rise looks uncomfortabley low wouldnt buy
  it is
  hes right lmao screaming  how behind you are
  i have some petit standards that ive been wearing a decent amount over two months and the seat is so tight i can barely squeeze a fart through do they ever get better or should i just get rid of them
cookie cutter fits from tumblr  probably a militant feminist   smokes cigarettes so smells like shit and not something nice like lavender   most of the time no brapper  will probably metoo you if you ever piss her off or become something  grows out armpit hair b/c muh liberation  likely has daddy issues not the good kind  bland sex unless you know what you are doing  ironic bangs colored hair and lipstick  listens to shit music like the smiths and brockhampton     dont date art hoes get yourself a cute japanese grill with a medical degree instead    chad
  everyone but the virgin autists on this retarded board who dress in all black cringecore know this already
cookie cutter fits from tumblr  yes  probably a militant feminist   sometimes but not categorically  smokes cigarettes so smells like shit and not something nice like lavender   sometimes but not categorically  most of the time no brapper  nice  will probably metoo you if you ever piss her off or become something  try not sexually harassing women  grows out armpit hair b/c muh liberation  no  likely has daddy issues not the good kind  everyone has mommy/daddy issues anon  bland sex unless you know what you are doing    ironic bangs colored hair and lipstick  yes thats what an art hoe is  listens to shit music like the smiths and brockhampton   all music sucks anyways  dont date art hoes get yourself a cute japanese grill with a medical degree instead  chad  i seriously doubt it
as i grow older well 25 i pretty much cant date girls who dont have good jobs im over dating students or baristas its comfy dating someone financially stable because that usually means theyre also normal this means art hoes are never a consideration    this is for long term dating of course
  i feel bad for you faggots honestly   somehow my small liberal college missed the pc/tumblr trend by a year or two 20122016   art hoes had some variation  they all shaved smelled nice  femme with a dash of girl power but not mill feminist  decent hair cuts but they were cookie cut who cares they didnt look like shit  arse can vary  no metoo scares because rape culture has not been fully programmed  they always listen to shit music you cant escape that  the best part was the thigh high socks fuckin hell those were in style where i went so distracting
  same here shit started taking off around 2015 we dodged it brah cheers
  the smiths are good
  seriously have had the same gf since 2014 and i feel like ive dodged a bullet most of my friends are single right now and having a horrible time in the era of tinder
  grows out armpit hair  but thats my fetish
  get into feet you degenerate
  sadly i lost mine at the end of college sweet and feminie chick i fucked it up now gotta deal with all this degeneracy youre a lucky guy anon
  youre a lucky guy anon  oh i know im going to put a ring on it in 2019  works in designer mid century modern furniture  ridiculous discounts on real classics  unironically trad with the reputation to back it up  mom has kept her looks up into her 60s   petiteshort  med/greek looks so nonna approves  call it a larp but i feel like ive hit the jackpot   sadly i lost mine at the end of college   dont give up hope she is out there somewhere you just need to keep getting out and meeting people connections are always key   were all gonna make it boys dont ever stop trying
  whats wrong with the smiths also arthoes wont listen to them anymore after morrissey upset everyone over the stuff he said
  punk hoeart hoe  liberate punk art hoes 2019 please  they are sacred and we must protect them at all costs  validate love support listen to and boost real ass punk chicks
  im the opposite been attached since age 22 now 25 my relationship is not going well so that may make me biased but sometimes i feel like i am missing out on being single in my mid 20s in nyc not because i can get girls easily but just to be free esp since i can afford my own place
whatever happened to goth gfs

  missing out on being single in my mid 20s in nyc   relationship problems  nyc will do that to you fuck loads of women live in nyc and a lot of them are very good looking compared to other big cities in the usa  esp since i can afford my own place  sounds like youre having   claustrophobia almost small place constant attention pressure  thoughts of long term at this stage   take some time off work and have an extended weekend to yourself go to your parents/brother/sisters place camping just get out of the metro area
  whatever happened to goth gfs  they still exist its just much more subtle these days and you need to run in the right circles
work with an art hoe who is actually a qt with sick fits but laughs really weird
  oof
how do you differentiate between art hoes and actually artistic/philosophical girls are poetry clubs good places to meet them
  this is not a shitpost  wow
  talk to them dumbass  and when you ask questions or get answers focus  pay the fuck attention before some broad walks all over you
  between art hoes and actually artistic/philosophical girls  seems like something you can easily figure out if you talk to them and youre not a poser
  actually artistic and philosophical girls dress less blatantly

  bland sex  thats unfortunately the only thing in my experience thats wrong about this list they let you do the wildest shit with them you just got to know if thats worth the hassle
high school tier story time    tfw smol qt asian looking gf  fits perfectly into my idea of perfect looks  smart and funny  god tier sex  got me into fashion and basically pulled me out of being a social degenerate  everyone i know likes her and vice versa  thinks of me as wise and smarter than her  feels great with me loves me unconditionally  gets sad and jealous every time she catches me following another arthoe clone on instagram   25 years together now  half a year ago i get closer with a filthy bland arthoe i met online for some reason  while still dating the qt gf  gf finds out eventually  still wants to be with me despite knowing how horrible i am  tfw i still love her but have to fight the urge to text the arthoe from time to time  tfw i know the arthoe girl is basically a manipulative filth impersonate  tfw i have everything i ever wanted and still demand arthoe attention    tldr  you are just as bad as art hoes if you find them attractive    just fucking redpill me for good please

  will probably metoo you if you ever piss her off or become something    be me  dating art hoe  always ask for consent before sex  tells me she has rape fetish  talk to her about how i dont want to ever do anything without her consent  anon you dont have to do that i promise i will tell you if i ever dont want to have sex  hrmmmm ok  keep dating a few months  we break up  she tries to get me back  no  couple months pass  tells our mutual friends i raped her and they hate me now  mfw    never dating art hoe again
  listen up faggot about to drop some knowledge    a good girl is hard to come by if you lose your current one itll take years to recover and after that theres a good chance you still wont have a replacement so do whatever you can do keep her in the end your dick might lead you astray and youll end up fucking the art hoe morally i have no opinion on this all i can say is if you end up fucking the art hoe cover your tracks and dont ever tell your gf if you cant deal with the fact that youll have to keep this from her forever then dont do it a dirty conscience will be the price you pay for fucking the art thot and frankly wont be worth it
  fucking rekt let that be a lesson
  after gf found out about the arthoe i really started doing my best to overcome the desire for the arthoe and i think im on the right track    thank you for helping me anon 3
  youre literally projecting this shit by the 02 art hoes you had some kind of flirtation/sex/relationship with  theres no such thing as art hoe theres boring girls out there and even if there were such a thing they arent as autistically specific as you put it out
tfw my gf is the arthoe  but im in the process of converting her to a wheyfu
    just another anon passing through but no goofy arthoe is worth it this anon absolutely correct in every way please listen to him youll never forgive yourself if you pick one
  it doesnt matter some onions boy in the diy scene will marry her she doesnt care if some edgy alt right /fa/ggot thinks shes gross the feeling is mutual
  why are wamen like this

  go for it but this photo sucks
do i have to wear black shoes/belt with a grey shirt    this is formal
  brown can be done how formal is the event
    presentation
  if this is school/university/work we cant really give the best advice since it depends on your institutions dresscode and customs    but i wouldnt think negatively about someone wearing brown shoes/belt if the fit is formal and well put together
  mommy
  gonna need more detail could be anything even some suedes    black is a safe bet if thats what you have m remeber to match socks to your pants and not your shoes
shes a big guy
  for you
      there is technically no dress code so its entirely up to me if i want to dress in a suit or shorts and a t shirt i just wanted to be more formal for the occasion also what should you match a tie with color wise
  fuggg shes perfect
  whats her name
  anastasia lux shes a goddess
  /victim of jivaro headshrinkers/core
  dont go with a suit and tie too formal and tryhard for a no dresscode kind of place heres what you do     figure out your blazer measurements shoulder to shoulder shoulder to cuff and chest size are most important measurements jacket length s r l is dependent on your height  use a sizing chart to figure out your blazer size  go on ebay  look for blazers in your size that you like make sure you check desc for specific measurements and seller reviews for accuracy     its best to get a blazer that already matches a pair of slacks and shirt you have fabrics matter  a houndstooth blazer looks better with black wool dress pants instead of black cotton chinos especially this time of year    now that you have a blazer you actually like and will probably fit you can start assembling your outfit blazer is the most important piece aside form shoes and needs to fit perfectly     other things to consider    pant length  dress sock color  shoe style i suggest black tassel loafer with leather sole  jacket lapel width   what type of pocket square instead of tie white linen with black trim is good for black and white houndstooth for example how you fold it  solid or striped ocdb with top 2 buttons undone     good luck   thats what im talkin about

im fucking addicted to eggs motherfucking eggs it started with 2 eggs a day then 4 6 and now 8 phenibutt fuck that now eggs are fucking addicting last time i made eggs my hand was literally shaking like a parkinson while i was holding an egg and i accidently cracked it too hard and it spilled on my counter some demonic entity must have possessed me at that moment because i fucking smashed the egg on the counter and actually cracked the counter i have never felt such rage before it must be from the eggs right how else can you explain it im scared i might start eating 12 eggs a day like a meme please help me

  rofl thanks for bring this back
  as someone whos actually was addicted to eggs for a while this is insulting
fuck im trying to get /fit/ and they almodt shilled eggs to me but now im fucking scared to eat them
        eggs are perfectly healthy and have nothing to do with heart disease the real reason for heart attacks and arthery blockage is inflammation which is cause by high insulin insulun resistance carbs sugar etc  eggs being bad is vegan propaganda be sure to buy free range though if you can find/afford them

  hello instagram memer
how do i into bdsmcore
growing up i was told shaving shit like legs arms ass etc is an unmanly/gay thing to do  well is it i mean what are the grills into what generally looks better  i mean im a pretty hairy guy so idk  also pretty skinny 199 bmi
  body hair is disgusting shave that shit    t female
i prefer being shaved but it is high maintenance so unless you have the time i wouldnt do it but instead trim every now and then also people are overrated so who cares what they think
  t female male    who gives a shit op some people like it some people hate it do what you want shaving the hair off of your body isnt going to instantly make you gay and in fact if youre that concerned youre probably in the closet anyway
you must trim your public hair at a minimum or it becomes a disgusting bush    everything else is up to you but i find trimming the underarms a universally good idea also trimming your asshole and taint eliminates dingle berries    but your chest and abs and legs and arms and happy trail whatever you want
  i shave my entire body hair is digusting    but im a fag so take my advice with a grain of salt
not waxing  its like you want to be itchy dont be a bitch and take the wax pill
  whats the best way to get rid of nipple hair plucking
  he hasnt taken the laserpill
    thanks for the advice m8s    how does one trim their asshole looks hard you probably need someone to do it for you honestly id rather not    drop the waxpill for me bro
  girls generally like hairless twink types
  get a bodyshaver like a philips and only use it for your butt literally all you do is squat down and move the electric bodyshaver along can be done in 30 seconds and eliminates dingle berries    its honestly fucking disgusting having long butthairs and dingle berries
  drop the wax pill  wat
  i shave my armpits purely to be more hygienic i trim everywhere else because stubble can be uncomfortable do not wax its not good for your skin plucking is only practical for your eyebrows or your face if youre an asian twink who cant grow a full beard      how does one trim their asshole  i mean you dont need to go that far or trim to zero or something just make sure to do it dry because trimming wet is not gonna work its not like shaving i usually just do it in the shower then i take an actual shower once im done ill deal with the clogged drain later on
  wat  the wax pill

  cum  i didnt ask for your favorite drink
  ok this is epic
i just buzz to a 1 all over my chest and stomach btw grills have always loved touching and rubbing the chest hair dont let hairless soi bros tell you otherwise
you guys are pathetic  men should only shave/trim face and pubic hair  maybe there are some exceptions of being excessively but that is far from the norm
  excessively hairy
i am likely the hairiest man on /fa/ do whatever you want if you wanna shave go for it if you dont dont ive fucked 15 girls so being hairy isnt that bad of a deal    i would recommend shaving your armpits for cleanliness sake and trimming your junk is good form     if you do choose to clean your chest up i would recommend waxing unless you intend to religiously shave your chest stubble is a pain in the ass and not fun at all to deal with    however if you shave your arms/legs/ass you are objectively a faggot i dont care who you are some things arent meant to be touched unless youre a competitive swimmer
the problem with my chest hair is that it looks like i caught the mange from having sex with my neighbours outside cats    so i trim down the patch spots and leave the rest i trim my pits so it doesnt look like i am trying to braid them i trim my pubes    nobody has mentioned feet no grills wants filthy hobbitses
you may not like it but this is what peak masculinity looks like
im very skinny 511 135lb and am very hairy below the waist ive never had any complaints about it though ive found women in usa generally prefer pubic hair to be shaved which is easy enough to do if you know someone wants it ive had a few women compliment me on my leg hair though and ill never shave it    i should probably mention however that the majority of my sexual encounters have been onetime affairs the one consistent fuck buddy i had liked my hairy legs and the few women i saw multiple times never said anything about my hair i doubt it was much of a factor for the onenight stands not being interested afterwards that was most likely due to my flat personality    tldr do what you want until you care enough about someone to change it
  imagine being halle berry in that scene and having to be all like damn pierce you fuckin fine all sexy with your strong body and horrific monster chest i would totally have sex with you both my character and the real me when all she really wants to do is fuck another 13 year old in her dressing room like seriously imagine having to be halle berry and not only sit in that chair while pierce flaunts his disgusting body in front of you the favorable lighting barely concealing his hepatitis and leathery skin and just sit there take after take hour after hour while he perfected that menacing look not only having to tolerate his monstrous fucking torso but his haughty attitude as everyone on set tells her hes still got it and damn pierce looks like that because theyre not the ones who have to sit there and watch his buckwheat fucking bigfoot chest contort into types of grimaces you didnt even know existed before that day youve been fucking nothing but a healthy diet of chadlets and supermodels and later alleged rape victims for your entire career coming straight out of the boonies in england youve never even seen anything this fucking disgusting before and now you swear you can taste the sweat thats breaking out on his distended stomach as he sucks it in to flex for the camera smugly assured that you are enjoying the opportunity to get paid to sit there and revel in his statuesque for that is what he calls it beauty the masculinity he worked so hard for with personal trainers in the previous months and then the director calls for another take and you know you could kill every single person in this room before the studio security could put you down but you sit there and endure because youre fucking halle berry youre not going to lose your future political career over this just bear it hide your face and bear it
  how does one trim their asshole
  fucking nasty no one wants to fuck sasquatch     t female
  female male
  speak for yourself
  i like your story anon good job
you dont have to some women and men like body hair but you should at least trim that shit keep it neat and tidy no one like unkempt hair     i trim pits pubes and and butt and shave balls id trim chest hair and shave back hair if i had any but i cant fucking grow any thank you genetics for giving me a ton of ass hair and the complete inability to grow a fucking beard
  unkempt hair  spindly and trailer parkish    if you can grow stylistic body hair then grow it you feg
one time when i was in high school i shaved all the hair on my dick and balls and for the next two days at school i constantly had to fight the urge to scratch at my crotch and im a greek guy so im pretty fucking hairy     ive come to embrace my hair but trimming if youre expecting some company couldnt hurt
  look up magic hair removal powder  weird but works  mainly use it for my balls lol
if my back is hairy are my options just waxing or an hero
  body hair is manly and nice if youre a little twink boy i can see why youd want to shave as not to ruin the angelic effect but if youre a man and not doing it for sport reasons dont hair looks nice it feels nice stubble does not
  thank you genetics for giving me a ton of ass hair and the complete inability to grow a fucking beard  this is the worst feel isnt it
  depends if you look like a cute weak boy chest hair will look gross on your if you look like a manly chad it will be a bonus
    fpbp
  really depends on you on your body and personal style there isnt really one true way to be attractive to all women while i am not especially hairy i do have more hair on my chest and stomach than most people i know especially my age so far the girls liked it i guess
  no    fuck off lesbian
i do  every other day   nether areas happy trail back of neck  weekly  underarms face thorough shave of every single genital hair  two weeks  arms and legs
  depends on your look and how fast hair grows  wax is only good if your hair grows super slow otherwise it is not viable and you need to shave every few days  armpits are bad to shave completely if you sweat alot the sweat drips same with ass pubic area is easily damaged and along with ass and armpit area the hair actually catches sweat and reduces smell also your dick might look like a worm same with women they dont need to shave all their pubes it actually smells worse and an orange razor burned vagina is not hot arms and legs are up to you best is to try shaving everything once and see how you like the look   lazer is very very painful if you have thick facial hair the pain is ridiculous and you have to go 1015 times which is unreal if you have thin hair i think it is much easier to do though but laser can also badly mess up your face almost every time for one or two weeks with scabs or big bumps an intense itch  if your face is hard to get a clean shave you can also use bb cream or foundation just light use fixes alot and covers discoloration from razor damage  you can also use makeup to cover your upper chest if you are wearing a v neck and have chest stubble  use an eyebrow razor for eyebrows and facial hair that is not a beard dont use real razors for that tweezers or threading is best but you cant do that shit everyday unless you have no life yet somehow high motivation for personal looks
  never been told my body hair was gross by a woman have had women play with my chest hair etc    i think more women prefer it definitely in my experience but im a 62 fat guy so i attract more women into the bear shit
if youre fit/skinny shave  if you chubby dont

  i just waxed my anus and surronding area now my asscrack is smooth like a bob sled runway the problem is my farts are louder because its smooth and moist so it produces more sound and i feel every molecule passing out from my asshole   i hope that it will soon grow back
  shaving anything other than your face/head is super fucking gay
theres some body hair that will never look good namely lower back hair shoulders ass feet zero excuse to have any hair there unibrows are terrible too  chest hair depends on personal style pubes should be at the very least trimmed if not completely shaved shaving your legs is weird youll get some comments if you do but i wouldnt say its a big deal
  unless youre part of half the population thats a heterosexual female and are attracted to menthen its fine
  whats fine a hairy back hairy feet hairy crack nobody likes that makes you look unkempt sure leg and chest hair can make you look manly having a natural wool sweater on your shoulders makes you look like a hobo
  or it makes you look like a man exaggerated masculine featuresjust like exaggerated feminine features are attractive to people even if theyre gross giant sloppy milkers are gross in theory but because theyre highly feminine its seen as attractive in a primal sense same goes with hair only low e females like twinks
  cant think of anything gayer than shaving your ass
  its not a big deal to shave anon most people really dont care even if youre afraid of being labeled as a faggot theres acceptable reasons you can give to people if its really that important like you could say you swim or you do some kind of sport/work where you get cut or scraped often and not having body hair helps with drag/helps injuries heal faster id bike/skateboard a lot ofc i dont really care about shit healing faster but its a good enough excuse bodybuilders also often shave body hair since it just looks better just dont be surprised or embarrassed if you look pretty effeminate after shaving
  girls like a wide range of dudes from hairy bara chubsters to skinny hairless twinks its all a matter of taste please dont mislead anon by stating stupid shit that implies all girls like x or y

if your body hair is so dark and obvious it turns girls away odds are youre a mutt that shouldnt be reproducing anyway that said i shave armpits for odor and cause it looks better pubes stay trimmed im filling out patchy facial hair with minoxidil but am usually shaved the rest of my body hair is blonde so i look like i shave makes me androgynous looking which girls like
  holy shit you guys are retarded ive been shaving balls gooch and bunnytail through touch alone since i was 15 and have never got cut/razorburn you get a feel for it if youve ever shaved your face in the shower without a mirror if you cant do that please dont try shaving junk you need to get coordination and learn other basic adult skills first      protip anyone telling you to nair your taint and balls is trolling your ball skin will peel for weeks
  very skinny  im the same height but 118 pounds   same with the hair situation  i trim everything up with clippers to preferred lengths like once a week
      
  fag
  you must trim your public hair at a minimum or it becomes a disgusting bush  a thick bush is literally the most attractive thing about a woman
  amazing how i can tell you are dirty poor third worlder just from your shirt
  i would recommend shaving your armpits for cleanliness sake  sweaty shaved armpits are literally the worst  having hair does not mean dirt  not bathing means dirt
  zero excuse to have any hair there  i can think of one being a mammal
  shaved armpits are not more hygenic though
what about butt asscheeks hair
post full body shaving routine how do you guys do this i only ever shaved my chest but i have some hair on arms and legs too im never going to shave my arms
  tyeti
gratuitous bearmode here i shave   face  back of neck every day   dick area and armpits once a week
i have not a single chest hair but pretty hairy legs should i trim my leg hair so i dont look as strange naked or at the beach i feel like there should be a balance
shave everything except arms legs and armpitsi dont have much armpit hair anyways all the hair on my body and face is patchy as fuck so id be a disgusting gremlin if i didnt
  theres nothing better after sex than laying your head on your boyfriends hairy chest and letting yourself melt away with every beat of his heart though  t male
  using shlomo shekelbergs hair removal on your genitals
tfw no testosterone so no chest hair
  if you have greek amounts of hair trim that shit but if you arent super hairy its a personal preference thing
women shave men dont
i just shaved everything neck down its pretty comfy did i just get pinkpilled
    i shave my armpits cause its so much easier and effective to shave every other week than use deodorant to mask odor the smell just isnt there after you shower and shave not that i smell bad my diet isnt junk its more for when im not sweating obviously if im working out the sweat drips instead of staying in the hair its not for everyone
  thats one really ugly pattern
  do you ever get buttcheek chaffige because these no longer hair down there to help things slide along
  you can shave your face your head and your cock  balls beyond that you are a fucking faggot
  body hair is natural however when it comes to back/ass hair it is not the most appealing but like leg hair and arms is almost all human beings so there is no need that said if you want to shave youre whole bodt sounds like a lot of work but it isnt gay and like rubbing shaved legs together is quite nice  i do persoanlly prefer a guy with hair its natural and can be used as a sort of contour casting shadows
  you only get those if you use toilet paper get a bidet
  as a female   i disagree i like a good amount of hair as long as its clean and trim nor do my friends like hairless men
  its weirder that you shave its like over grooming probably trim your pubes occasionally since that might actually matter if youre super hairy  boys have bare chests
  t female  youre a gay dude
  depends on mode  if youre an ottermode or twink you may as well shave everything  if youre stacked or bear mode may as well shave nothing if youre in between youll want to find a middle ground
so tell me /fa/ggots why do you consider docs shit and poor taste here
  1 every 15yo girl has them  2 theyre very overpriced for corrected grain garbage  3 theyre ugly
  what do you find ugly about them be specific  theyre not that pricy also
  not that anon im sure they have their own reasons but the silhouette is bulbous not flattering at all especially if you have large feet the yellow stitching is also ugly they are plastic chinese garbage
also op pic looks like a fag and npc
  what do you think about the made in england models they also have the vintage versions that doest have the bulbous nose
  you dont need to hide it were all /fa/gs here
  i dont hate them personally but buy solovairs instead theyre the same thing but better
  i see they have horizontal lacing as their feature not really a fan of that so no
im really tempted by these solovairs
  so relace them are people on 4chan really this dumb
  how are they better then
  what the fuck are you braindead
  solovair is nice i own the 11 eye hawkins and theyre great
  yes actually
  can you make a photo of them irl please    did anyone comment on them
get some milsurp combat boots they look better and will last a lot longer than those chinese shitkickers
/fa/ i summon your help in telling me what my face shape is also face shape  complimentary hairstyle thread
  op here what is your pin on my face shape  inb4 ugly faggot
oval but you look like you have fairly round cheeks could just be the angle  beautiful eyes
  thanks anon heres a more recent shot that shows my cheek
  faux hawk  traaaaaaaaash
  literally 80 of these are shit fuckboy undercuts with different names
  i have determined i have an oval shape but receding hairline what do will post pic if needed
  and undercut isnt an entire entire haircut its just part of a style    post
  an anon last night recommended a french crop with a fringe which im not opposed to but id like some more opinions or options
  your hairline isnt that bad desu is your hair usually wavy or curly
hello am i oval face shape
  you have a heart shaped face for sure
  oblong i think your face is much longer than it is wide
  my chin isnt quite that pointy id say its oval but with slight concave sides
  its between oblong and triangular
  youre a handsome guy but i would recommend a nice trim all over to get rid of some of your frayed hairs also some new frames would take you from handsome to really handsome
  protip if youre fat af in the face at the current time just grow a beard youll appear 5x less fat
    really for so long i thought i am oval shape ok then  here is another photo where i am short haired and extra unattractive i really cant tell myself what shape that is anymore
  you do not have an oblong face you are toeing the line between square and oval also youre not unattractive work on that confidence my man
  it is also harder to tell as my face is asymmetric af    but you can not deny that specifically on the last photo i look like shit i didnt know what i was thinking going bald at that time
i assume im oblong
  chris pratt is that you
  every single time stop
  holy shit mate you look just like chris pratt how often do you get that if your jawline was a bit stronger and square you could convince me youre chris pratt
  kek then put   inb4 chris pratt
  damn when i was a kid everyone used to call me mr bean because i kinda looked like him i cant even imagine how bad it is for you
  i was told i looked like daniel radcliffe when i was clean shaven and hugh jackman when i had facial hair my entire life until i changed my hair after high school
  how often do you get that  every time i post my picture on /fa/
  i would say yours is triangular as your chin is flatter on the bottom
  mate you would look glorious with long hair
  you think so i was actually rocking some decent lenght hair approximately 3 years ago pic related it was the longest i had
what face shape do i have im considering getting a fringe of some sort not sure advice
  fucking shave it you retard how do people like you ever think you look good with that haircut and shitty beard

allsaints for like 500  schott for like 750  falcon garments for like 850925 depending on if you go mtm or go lamb/goat/calf    i bought a dr from falcon a few months back and im pretty happy just because their cs team is super active and helps you get the perfect size even if you dont go the mtm route       also you dont need to be /fit/ to wear a perfecto its the pinnacle of the slim fit meme it makes herointhin twinks look just as good as it made brando look hedi would be homeless if only thicc dudes could pull off a perfecto
  stop appropriating my culture if you dont have a motorcycle dont wear biker jackets

  theyre just random advertisements for timberland boots that ive found the point i was trying to make is that whites are not copying black culture by wearing timberland boots the boots have been worn primarily by white outdoorsman since the 1970s when the boots were released the timberland original yellow boot wasnt popular with black americans until the 1990s when hip hop artists coopted the boots and began promoting them
a better fit of ye but not double denim
    yeah hes got some good fits he just doesnt look that good because hes an ugly dude
  how did they do it back then    they did like this
  why do they love work boots if they dont work
  wtc
  what year is this from when did everyone cuff their pants like that
  why do they love basketball shoes if they dont play bball  why do they love runners if they dont run  why do they wear skate shoes if they dont skate
    mid 80s paninaro era think they wanted to show their burlington socks or just a /fa/ statement of that time
  god rihanna is the best
he claims hes /fa/ but doesnt ride a harley
  how much of those bikes are made in the usa and not some shithole country
  hasnt taken the cafe pill
harleys are literally the tryhards of motorcycle if youre not a hells angel
  victory is much better
is the 2006 jetta tdi effay
  he claims hes /fa/ but doesnt take public transportation everywhere sitting in the back alone hunched over with his hood on looking down often missing his stop because he wasnt looking
im a loser trying to improve my fashion sense tell me if this combination looks retarded /fa/    shoes and belt are light brown with burgundy tones
yes the shirt looks horrible and burgundy is a shit colour    looks like autism
wear a normal white shirt
that sears dress shirt tho
  for the love of god dont match your tie and pocket square with the exact same fabric its a sin that the wedding industry pushed onto men who dont know how to complement accessories
  take that shit to the tailor and never pair that tie with that pocket square also where are your pants
  no pants im poor
  what would you suggest instead or what should i be looking for when choosing a tie/pocket square
  tie  pocket square might be too dressy if you dont have the full suit what are you wearing this for anyway      not the guy you are responding too but you can get away with different pattern or shade of the same color or go for a split compliment with your shirt
  sorry im retarded pants are the same color and the suits been tailored already    okay the shirt looks terrible and i need to find a pocket square thats different from the tie    so for example lets say i go with a plain white shirt would a pocket square in a different shade of red with a pattern or print in white be appropriate
  honestly it depends on the shirt too like the other dude said as long as they share a colour or pattern you should be good just not too similar and not too different pictured here is the last match i did with my suit the pocket square is a little noisy but the tie is mostly neutral id wear a white shirt underneath this as well   if you want to pull that look off without spending another dime i would ditch the tie and leave the pocket square that shirt has more of a casual pattern and should be worn as such
  based on op youre probably gonna fuck up any color combination you think up just do a white pocket square in a conservative fold and a neutral tie navy for example pic related for example of these colors
  get a new tie in a more subtle and versatile color a new pocket square in a different color than the tie and a fabric that isnt shiny or ditch the pocket square all together and a new shirt in solid white or solid light blue your jacket looks fine next to all that other trash but its probably not that great either next time you buy a suit have someone else pick it out for you since you cant be trusted
throw out the pocket square theyre dumb get a plainer shirt and a more interesting tie that shirt in particular screams kohls
this has to be a troll  grey suit looks cheap to begin with but whip out a stark white or light blue shirt navy tie and fuck off with the hanky and you might make it
  i like pocket squares but i think you should show only a tiny proportion of them
no i think that looks nice
  changing your fashion doesnt change who you are youll just be a better dressed loser
op here    i dont think i look completely retarded anymore
  yeah because thats a different jacket retard also get rid of that pocket square either replace it with a solid white or dont use it that one looks like something a dandy or a gay man would wear
  im a raging faggot so ill keep it    and its the same jacket my phones camera sucks
all black clothing thoughts do you wear all black do you know a guy or girl stories go
would look pretty cool at funerals imo maybe at high class nightclubs where you do not have to wear a tux but it would look out of place otherwise imo
  i would immediately assume you are in mourning
love it all black is dope
  pretty badass imo makes you look like a matrix character
i went through a phase where i wore all black because it was the only outfit i had at the time that looked good im pretty sure from my experience thats its a social no no
    barmancore
be me  wearing full black goth ninja  was sitting outside with smokers most of the night  2 guys eyeing me off whole night was presuming they were mirin my fit  eventually they approach me  hey man dont mean to be an asshole but why have you been sitting on your phone all night youre at a party you should be drinking and shit  well im browsing this fashion forum i visit frequently and someone posted a thread with a webm of this guy fisting these 2 dudes elbow deep and then pulling his arms out and exposing their prolapsed colons then plays with them like theyre puppies i wanna see how long the thread lasts cause its a worksafe board ahah  get kicked out later on because people were getting intimidated by my full black outfit    anyone else got any cool stories of them wearing full black
the japanese yakuza have a saying shiro nara shiro kuro nara kuro translated for all you baka gaijin it means if you are gonna wear white go all white if you are gonna wear black  go all black    accent in an outfit is for plebs
diego simeone is the only guy ive seen pull it off
all black is too easy you could wear pretty much anything all black and itll look normal    i personally stay away from all black so i can work on color schemes and make outfit pop
ive always liked all black/punk/metal clothes but recognize its usually pretty cringy trying to work on not buy computer parts and buy clothes instead to experiment with darker/mostly black clothes without it being teenage angst shit
black clothing looks like shit and should be reserved for funerals  people who wear all black are cringe
  haha lol epic so random
i like wearing all black but not everyday its a leftover of my gothicphase
    what about john wick
i wear a lot of all black but thats because i do a lot of theatre and live event production and thats the name of the game i have branched out to more colors and chinos lately but i do feel home in all black    throw in some color every once in a while and you should be good
  all black looks cool
all black is the god tier clothing option and allows for a completely interchangeable closet i almost exclusively wear black
never wear a black collared shirt unless you want to look like you work at applebees    all black can work if you pair a black tee with an olive / khaki bomber
  color is the dumb way of making an outfit pop thats being normal use silhouette and texture and it is far more impressive
  lmao you realise how hard this is to pull off  99 of people will look like autistic tryhards doing all black
  should
  then just dont be an autistic try hard baka
i rarely see people wearing all black anymore the only time i have in recent memory is some 57 30 year old trying his very best to look cool in what looked like an all gap outfit consisting of a bad overcoat poor quality jumper ill fitting trousers and cheapo sunglasses despite it not even being very sunny
i wear all black but white shoes because im a coward
  nice drips
  i wear all black with white tops
i had to wear black at work years after years my wadrobe goes darker i only keep a grey shirt as a mark of vivid color and to feel funny at workplace    please help me
  i get what your saying but i was thinking more adult style clothing not a tee shirt and jeans
i do high end security mostly for some alist celebs     my company allows all black suits with some room for improvisation     ive been wearing a black collared shirt but should i got for a black polo or maybe a nice black shirt instead
  also what color accessories would go best with this     i was thinking a gold watch and a gold band that i wear on my index finger
  all black is retarded you need contrast so pin stripes silver or gold trim etc
i only wear black  green every other color is shit
  how about a white pocket square
  unfortunately i think they want us in all black clothing wise
  fuck up weeb
  then maybe a black one with an interesting fabric or very slight pattern thats also in black
im a designer at one of the biggest automotive companies i always wear black only so do many of my coworkers usually the really talented ones not sure why     i think its common for designer in higher position
its fine with casual clothes it looks whack with a more formal outfit end of discussion
  im a designer at one of the biggest automotive companies    your termination notice is coming in tomorrow    
  silver
  thats what im trying to figure out is how to do exactly that past my teenage years so i want to make it more presentable
  all white  based so hard to keep looking clean though
do you wear all black  its all i wear almost all the time year round  for me its about comfort  i have some anxiety problems and am also a very high functioning sperg therefore its important for me to wear what makes me comfortable a part of that is black its just comfy for me i dont know why i feel that way about it but thats why i wear all black
  and this is what separates the truly fashionable from the tryhard autists
all black is definitely a winner heres me with a great fit from last week
  shirts are the only item that should never be black
  vice versa black t shirt sucks suit on the other hand looks slick
i seldom wear all black but blackwhite make up most of my wardrobe
  i love wearing all black but a shirt in dark grey often goes better with all black more than a black shirt does
  is this the real yohji
    stories    one day i wore all black the end    but seriously really boring but i get it if you are wearing all black as a statement ie metalhead goth etc
  thats not you is it your that guy salmon of asgard
  i like it had to go to a nightclub in la for a birthday and wore a slim black jacket black t shirt slim black jeans cut at ankle with loafers and got lots of compliments
  can you get a super dark grey suit shirt and suit shouldnt match but instead be close different shade of blacklighter than suit or maybe dark grey private security pays well get yourself a yellow gold carrier tank and a signer ring of some kind dont wear a tie in your profession get the suit made with an action back and the pants with a gusseted crotch i worked security once upon a time and just implemented tactical clothing features into my suits there are companies that do this now grayman clothing i think its owned by crye precision just search for suits on solidersystems daily and youll find it
  how about a black long sleeve tshirt with a black blazer
  thanks man im gonna look into that
    i got the oversized uniqlo black open collar shirt from the last u release i used to think that black dress shirts are strictly gas station attendant or waitercore but it works pretty well in a casual all black fit with slimfit jeans and docs/wyatts/sneakers
  all black is very lazy and uninspired imo   unless youre a tech ninja i suggest against it
  doesnt look good imo   makes his body look really small which makes it looks like he has a giant floating head
literally own nothing but black clothes well okay a couple white tshirts and a navy blazer but thats it
all black is obviously good but all black suits with black ties etc are a little cringe    this nigga sums it up
  you look retarded
black suit and black shirt work but i think adding a black tie inevitably makes it look tacky    allblack works when you go for minimalism i think and ties are very notminimalist in a way if anything a black turtleneck would work better probably
  no he looks like a gay twink aka male model
  olive bomber   youre stuck in 2015
got a psychedelic/60s pop gig coming up in a bit as lead guitarist what are some /fa/ fits to look the part    pic semi related tryna pull off a headband underneath my hair
  wanting to cosplay cia psyops from your parents generation
  never really got that shit in the uk and my bandmates are all stoners from australia
  take a look at mgmts earlier tour outfits/looks nice and greasehippy
you want to look like that instead of someone halfway fashionable like jimmy hendrix just look modern festival goers and dont spend too much on anything
  beyond based
  sorry its tiny
  yeah thats what im going for      pretty much yeah      pond are great havent ever looked at what the band wear though
  i think the key is to be skinny and have long hair at that point just wear a headband and itll work out
recently brought this nike puffer in a charity shop thrift store and noticed the tick was on the wrong side anyone know why its got all the right tags and stuff
post the tags
  a very large majority of these patches are on the left but there are a few on the right that look like rejects same situation with college campuses
  theres washing tags on the bottom aswell
  thats fair you think its intentional or a reject then
  fake  dont try and kid yourself into thinking its some special one off although real nike is made in china so who gives a shit really
maybe is a batch made for high schools so they can put their soccer team patch over the heart its common in my country    pic related you can order the squad uniform with custom silkscreened numbers and logos
    nike uses the logo on both sides
fake
  nike team is a product line for schools and amateur teams logo is on the right side as you are supposed to leave space for the teams crest on the left
this thread is about the appreciation of watches as well as the microengineering and materials engineering that are required to make a functioning timepiece     required viewing for new people         used watch guide       strap guide       watch essentials 102      previous thread  
any of you guys have a vostok neptune they will be bringing them back around apparently not a fan of the integrated lugs since they like to use scrap metal for bracelets but i still want one
is this the best watch ever made
swiss perfection
  neptunes use solid steel links bruh
  ah good then
  how can the rolex hulk even compete with this
the royal oak is a love it or hate it watch what are your thoughts
  love the design personally its easy enough to see its influence on other watches
  its an alright watch i prefer the quartz version
  hail mary touchdown love it
  looks bloated and boring desu how much does one cost
lolz   what a piece of shit this is
im thinking of buying this casio watch should i get a black or white one
  white looks more sophisticated in my mind
  black one
  literally a pretentious panerai
  im afraid the glass and case is shitty plastic like the casio royale
  yea i know that i have a couple of casio watches but i just like the look of them for the price they cost
is there any g shock that isnt big af besides the dw5600
help me choose please
  twotone anything  get the bottom if you really want it and change the bracelet you sad nasty faggot
  whats wrong with twotone i just want something flashy for once already have a lot of boring stuff
  yes look at a catalog of gshocks/the gshock bible there are fucktons that arent big do any amount of research past the first page of amazon or ebay
  then get a all gold tone version
  too streetwear
  nah  a gold watch can make a formalcasual outfit less boring but then i am not american everybody here owns gold jewelry because catholics apparently cant be baptized if theyre not given a gold chain
  right well im not american either and here in protestant europe all gold stuff is considered very tacky and only hiphop/streetwear kids tend to have allgold watches   twotone is the flashiest you can potentially get away with
  white
looking to get the casio protrek prg330 its the lightest of all the current protrek models should i get black pinko or wite     i will actually go /out/ with it cause it will be a replacement for the very old 15 years old protrek that i have so i am leaning towards black or pinko because somehow they look like they wont mind getting it scratched up     that said one issue i have with my current protrek is the resin band wears out and breaks easily
recommend me a watch to replace my citizen with    top right is what i wear most days
  this is why this seiko is miles better than those awful metal g shocks theyre gangsta af
  just wear the fleiger instead of the citizen theyre fairly similar
  yeah i find myself wearing the flieger more than the citizen which is why i am considering getting rid of the citizen    at the same time i dont want to have more than 4 watches    if i am getting new watch itch what style do yall think i should be looking into
  get the digital seiko as above
  why do you hate the gshock so much  the metal version is alright
  i love it as a watch but id only wear it if was black
  swap your citizen with the citizen in the op to cover your dire dress watch needs desu    what is the op citizen anyways i kind of like it
  i would too if i was a retard      im sure all the garbage you own and aspire to purchase looks much better      panerais are ugly and you cant afford either stick to vostok rubbish
  stop posting those disgusting overpriced seiko shitters
  960 is actually the best model small round case and pinned bracelet it cant possibly fall off a pin so its a great option for actually diving
  i dont really aspire to own any high end watch im selling my only luxury watch now im red pilled
      im guessing this is the tgv effect at work
  what is the ref number of top right
  the guy is so powerful to these dorks tgv probably bought up 20 royal oaks and now he can sell them for inflated prices now the gentry cucks are aware of them
  fucking shitheads should stay in youtube and not come here ruining proper discussion
  youre a clueless cunt
  yema watches have some pretty cool aesthetic
were there any regular blue or black dial seamasters with the wave dial and raised indices like the gmt pic related has the regular ones such as on the 2531 seem rather flat in comparison
  looks like dogshit
  what were they thinking it looks so bad
    aside from the glaringly red gmt hand whats wrong with this over the regular seamaster
guys should i get the sxk0013 or spend like 50 bux more for a samurai/turtle i dig the size of the skx but i also dig the finishing details of the later
  if you can get a samurai over the sxk for a mere 50 bucks i say go for it make sure its the one with the black dial though the others look like shit
  samurai is an awesome watch its so much more solid than the skx you should get one what colour are you thinking of getting
  either orange or pepsi i really like the orange and the price is right but fuck me i know sizewise the skx would look better on my 65in wrist
im kinda scared ill get a bad qc / returned skx though
even the gold turtle is a pretty decent deal rn ive tried on a turtle samurai and skx009 the bigger one and still cant decide
  i have a 6 wrist have owned both and despite being a bit bigger the samurai was by far the better looking when worn and got more compliments so theres that go for the samurai if it were a case of 100 dollar difference it would be up for debate but at 50 dollars you literally cant go wrong
need a watch thats more casual than a dress watch but more dressy than a diver
  orient bambino/defender/sun and moon maybe a hamilton
  hamilton khaki mechanical  orient defender  vostok komandirskie auto  basically any field or flieger watch
thoughts will it cover my current collection for all my needs    
  meh
is seagull 1963 still good is there any other mech chrono that is a better value than this at the same price range im about to pull the trigger and order it
  i think im in the same situation as you because im trying to round off my collection with something not silver and without a black face    i really like the seiko you posted but i might go for a bambino    good choice anon
so how big do your wrists have yo be in order to wear a seamaster planet ocean
which of the komandirskie classics are worth buying for an everyday shitter
should one even bother with watches if you dont have 20k on your wrist i feel like anything less is just embarrassing
  out of curiousity what do you mean by still good
  none they are garbage just buy a timex
    you probably bought the se
  this only rich people deserve to know the time
    then buy an apple watch so you can be an npc like everyone else
    both look nice i would get the white one but with numerals instead of batons i have it and like it so much more but to each his own       yep can confirm the case is chrome plated plastic it did not scratch so far after about 1 year of almost daily usage glass is also plastic but not easily scratched with any other watch i would have said its total dogshit but casio is not pretending to be something that they are not and the price is so cheap i cant hate them for going plastic if you want a metal version get a skmei on aliexpress they have one that looks like the aq230 with lots of color options    here is another glroious digi ana shitter i love the ridiculous design
  what i mean is that i havent been lurking watch threads in a long time so i thought that there might be a better option
  the lugs are tiny though so it will work   buy it mate
  applied indices look like trash on a wave dial    also those arabic numerals mixed with diver indices are fucking disgusting
  yes there were it was the first coaxial seamaster ref 222080    its terrible the look is bad and the movement is worse its omegas first coaxial attempt and they are unreliable as hell search the forums getting one that works well is luck of the draw if you buy one prepare for a full movement rebuild if you want it working properly    either get the successor with the plain dial or the predecessor with the superb calibre 1120 non coax
great video of a guy dismantling a miyota movement then a swiss eta i think   
  thats one pure class anadigi timepiece
        i like the extra thin steel one with blue dial cant quite justify spending in excess of 15k on it though          i was kinda surprised that he bought one doesnt really seem like his thing
        came across this the other day also anadigi but from what an anon said in here these are allsteel not sure if the crystal is plastic though    i really like the look and while more expensive than a casio theyre still well under 100 bit hard to find in europe though
  sorry about thatcaptcha was being strange    at this price point you cant beat the chinese its a manual wind columnwheel chronographfor less than 500 no one produces one for less    have you decided on the size and colour combination
  order one on amazon ebay etc you wont get customs for these kind of shitters  get a vintage piece if you can though they always look better and are better built 99 of the cases
  you wont get customs for these kind of shitters    thats got a lot more to do with the shipper and the package/mail serve though for eu shipments its usually required to attach an invoice on the outside of the package and since package/mail companies can charge you for doing the customs check they often do i had to pay 31something on a 65 watch off of creationwatches the other day
  i had to pay 31something on a 65  fucking ridiculous  what country are you at    i suppose you can get one from ebay and message them to put like 20 usd value and thats it depends on the seller though
  arent they like 200
  i have a thin wrist so 38mm and i want the black panda dial
  fucking lol i was just searching for this model to answer to this anon  yeah its sad that they dont make many these days based citizen still has this one in production    yep these are all steel the glass could be real glass tho not sure i like the blue white one if they had it with numbers instead of batons i would be sold just imagining those blue numbers makes my autism happy
  fucking ridiculous  yeah rougly 13 actual vat no added import fee because costs 120 and max import fee for a wristwatch is just 080 anyway then another 13 handling costs charged by the mail service also a few euros in change because some cunt filed it for 103usd instead of 103sgd singapore dollars about 20 euros less in total so about 4 euros overtaxed     the main reason the costs are so high which is also the reason the odds of being slapped with charges are the 13 the post company charges for doing the formalities something you do not ask for and for which no alternative exists  what country are you at  the netherlands but i imagine most european mail/package services do similar things
  i just see this shit in all the garbage stores in moscow
  which is also the reason the odds of being slapped with charges  are so high    the mail company doesnt pay the tax so they dont care filing the forms is probably an online thing or something they can rubberstamp 284x an hour so charging 13 for every single item imported that costs more than 20 is probably a godsent for them in these days margins in the logistics world are very very thin
  yea in uk we have a 8 handling fee those fuckers must make a fortune
  here you just get a notice if the customs have it and you have to fill a customs form everything is free but they also charge you customs for the postage you paid for the item  i once had to pay 40  the price of a cheap watch as customs tax   next time i will just lie about the postage price if it is an issue they have no actual way of knowing how much it was
    postage price and insurance is also included in eu/netherlands but if the shipping is actually free as in the shipping column on your invoice says 000 then youre not taxed for that they dont look at the actual cost of sending the package just what youre charged    also they combine stuff so if you order 10 shitters that would be tax free in one package you can still be taxed because the total amount exceeds the tax free limit or 1 item thats just under might go over if the shipping feeinsurance are on the invoice
apologies againcaptcha is impossible today      depends on where you get it there are several online dealers and you have to factor in shipping costs and all those things i said under 500 because it might cost you 250it might cost you 400     one thing that i personally considered when buying mine was to allot an extra 2030 for my watchmaker to have a look at it upon delivery just to make sure the movement was sound if you have a trusted watchmaker have him look it over when you get yours and he can fix or adjust anything that is wacko with watches like these there is no guarantee that theyre in perfect running order after theyve been shipped       i have the 38 and its awesome i tend to normally wear 4042mm but honestly the size really doesnt make a difference because once youve worn any watch for more than 5 hours you get used to the size regardless     black panda dial looks cool good luck with your purchase
    sent a long letter signed with fountain pen sealed in an actual envelope because even though they can track your package from asia and embrace all forms of digital communication they actually force you to buy stamps and an envelope if you want to reclaim costs    i requested the 13 handling fee back as well as the overcharged taxes because paying for a sub par service seems a bit rich to me that said theyll probably take the chance that im not taking a day off to contest it in small claims court and theyd be right
  that watch is ugggllyyy
  this but 5k because im too poor to get one that is 20k
  do not get gold plated its either 18k or bust
  where did you get that picture of my wife the one in the middle not the two roasties on the side
  the virgin reverse  vs    the chad seiko
  gentry cucks  you mean the young gentry his zoomer fanbase i would have doffed my cap to you if you werent so snobbish good sir  sincerely  tristano geoffrey michele veneto tgmv
which produce the better sub homage in the 500 price range steinhart or squale
  unironically squale  the name can be a minus though
i present to you the best anadigi ever made
does anyone knows the model of this watch   got it from my father
  lcd displays the analog part  bin it fucking garbage  you cant see the time at a glance from that also those are shit in low light conditions where the analog hands would still be visible
  the blue squale is handsome as hell
  it has a backlight you dolt those other anadigis would be invisible in the dark
  you addressed one of my two points well done
what you boys think
  i already own two seiko digital watches
  because the other point was valid it shouldnt have a second hand
  pureclass  i am just speechless
  post them
  right one needs to get fixed
  nice love that left one
    where did you take these pictures  or are those really yours and its a form of elaborate trolling
  whats wrong with it
  what do you mean thats my dining room
  i refuse to believe some /fa/ggot just pops up with collection of calculator watches out of nowhere  post a timestamped picture or your mother will die in her sleep tonight
    i dont have a timestamped picutre as theyre back in the safe now
  theyre back in the safe now  next time dont make it that obvious it was a good start though
  lolz  i got the photos here       this clown is trying to get 1500 for those
  i refuse to believe some /fa/ggot just pops up with collection of calculator watches out of nowhere    theres a handful of posters in these threads that collect weird digitals and quartz watches is it really that unbelievable    the ductape rolls are a nice touch
    i bet he posts here anyway even though it isnt you
  some of those are actually very collectible dont know if it justifies that kind of a price though
can this pass off as the real thing for you guys 550 for a rep though the price is getting insane
    yes you should go post in tgvs comment section where you belong      pure class  lmao you too
  buying fakes
  yes and anyone who says otherwise is a liar   did you really spend 550 on a replica
  why would anyone pay that much for a fake
    ive never handled the real thing and neither have most people so who knows the fact that the cyclops is tilted so that you cant see the magnification doest bode well though
  the fake cyclops are pretty good nowadays
i have a tissot le locle with a leather strap can the strap be replaced with a metallic bracelet
citizen watch
  yes it can be removed easily all you need to do is pull the strap as hard as possible from each side and it should detach
  it has a better finish and movement than any seiko in that price range
    its still a replica why would you literally larp as someone wearing a rolex
im a noob when it comes to watch specifications but why cant you go swimming with a watch that has 3 atm water resistance isnt it supposed to be able to go 30m deep under water and survive
    its supposed to but for some reason manufacturers have universally decided that 3atm doesnt actually mean that it can handle 3atm of water pressure 30atm water resist/50m is basically splash resistance and 100m means you can reliably swim with it    i dont really get it either but that seems to be the thing
  but that seems to be the thing  in general i should say there are certainly 50mrated watches out there you can swim with i just wouldnt ever blindly assume you can just because it says so on the dial
can anyone identify this watch
  theres a lot of weird ideas out there about water resistance     a 30m wr rating specifically means that the watch wont leak under 30m water equivalent pressure if that were the end of the story you could swim with it just fine debunking of the common myth that when youre swimming your arms movement through the water dramatically increases the pressure is here   theres a number of complicating factors    unless the watch is certified as a diver watch it probably hasnt actually been tested standard wr watches are sample tested  the manufacturer tests say 1 of watches to ensure most of then meet the standard there is an iso process for sample testing you can look up if youre curious your watch may never have been tested in which case its up to the manufacturing consistency and quality control of the manufacturer whetheryour watch is constructed the same as the samples that passed     seals can degrade over time even if your watch had 30m wr when it was made it may not any more as seals age they harden which can make them less effective at sealing to have faith in your watchs wr you should be testing it every year and every time its opened     if youve tested your individual with recently and it passed a 30m test it is perfectly fine for surface swimming the reason people often say your watch needs 100m wr and a screw down crown for surface swimming is a hope that such overspeccing will mean that even watches that havent been tested are likely at least good enough
  ive swam with my f91w and it survived i found it on holiday and it says water resist on the front so i thought that meant i could swim with it i still have it 10 years later and everything works fine except for the light f91w has 3atm water resistance
  seals can degrade over time even if your watch had 30m wr when it was made it may not any more as seals age they harden which can make them less effective at sealing to have faith in your watchs wr you should be testing it every year and every time its opened    tbqh it doesnt help that manufacturers typically put do not swim or shower in the manual even for wr watches
    yeah mines been in the shower accidentally a bunch of times pretty sure those are relatively water resistant from factory not necessarily if you ever change the battery though
terrible photo will probably switch to normal wristshots soon like a normal person since the collection is growing at least til i get a 24 box
    whats the subclone diver with the octopus on the dial
  what does what the manufacturer put in the manual have to do with how wr your watch is either it has been tested to be wr either by you or by the manufacturer in a diver watch in which case it is perfectly safe to swim with it to the tested depth or it hasnt been tested in which case whether its wr is unknown     the manuals that say this 30m wr watch is not suitable for swimming is simply an admission we have no idea if this watch is wr do not claim that it is and will not accept warranty returns if it is not the text on the dial is merely there for decoration
watches are larpcore if they arent smart watches these days like nigga u aint got a smartphone u guys own pocketwatches too pocket squares
  u aint got a smartphone u guys own pocketwatches too  the irony in this
  following the same logic why get a smartwatch when you have a smartphone in your pocket getting a smartwatch is arguably even more pointless
  phoibos py007c  its what replica dude above should of bought ive seen a lot of sub homages the octopus logo is what made me want it
  omega speedmaster
whats a good price for a date just 16233 36mm two tone from the 90s    been eyeing one at a pawn shop but the sticker says 7k ive heard about these being had for 2500 but all the online store want around 5k help please
currently living it large in the carribean how has your week been so far /wt/
  sub hands are shaped with a curve anyone who takes more than a five second glance at that shitter will see that the hands on it are flatter than your gfs buttcheeks
  007c    very nice
  not him but  admits it still has better finish and movement than any seiko in that price range  lmao seikofags btfo imagine paying that much for a seiko
  i agree entirely that anon should have purchased a more humble timepiece such as a tudor heritage black bay
  sup tudorfag long time no see  how are you doing you old cunt
  admits    more like didnt contest tbqh i dont own a seiko in that price range so i dont know i have a 100 one thats finished decent enough for what it is i suppose
  apparently hanging on the beach with this boyfriend  glad hes getting fucked for once instead of fucking the thread
how many of you would buy this for under 300  i wouldnt but theres a sale so
  doing great my dude havent had too much time recently to support between all the champagne sunbathing sex with hot women and enjoying expensive genuine watches
  recently to support between  recently to shitpost
  if i really wanted a cheap diver i think i might   but i have no need or desire for one personally its not a bad buy for under 3 though
  aye brother glad to hear you are doing as usual we here in shitter central were getting a bit worried when we didnt hear from our favourite son

  i forget which hamilton this is remind me most hamiltons honestly dont look very good but that one does
ive found some super aesthetic watches but get extremely triggered by the thought of wearing a gold colored watch thats not actually made out of gold    pic unrelated
is there a version of this without the small seconds i think the orient star semiskeleton is beautiful but i hate small seconds
  forgot to say i know theres one thats not small seconds but im looking for one with the additional 2 oclock cutout
  in that case no
  thats honestly depressing

  remove that grand seiko shit and youve got yourself a list
  fine
  rolex has become a meme watch like gucci and louis vuitton for rappers and sportsball players to brag about lots of knock offs as well cheapen the brand
  why do ppl get jealous when you show them the gold stunner
  you have no idea what you are talking about what you have said is extremely irrelevant
  t rolex owner
  rolex is trash dude its too mexican and arab     if youre wearing a rolex and youre not wearing jordans or yeezys youre wearing the wrong watch
  fuck me dead youve got fucking rocks in your head cunt    rolex is the luxury watch brand it doesnt matter what your shit for brains cunt mouth says rolex is luxury    fuck me dead
  he bought a rolex    rolex style has been copied by literally everyone such to the point that when i see one i think of a cheap 20 watch sold on a rotating display in a mall kiosk
  omega seems out of place
  i gotta admit growing up i associated rolex with rappers and new money retards but now that im getting into watches i respect the hell out of rolex despite how hard its been memed by bad examples too much significance and too much quality
  that other anon must have put his life savings into a rolex

  shooooooooooop
  please be a bad dream
  curve  what in the fuck are you talking about
  the greatest flattery is imitation     imitators do not detract from the original if anything they give the original rolex more value       man on the fucken moon
  why are you even seriously replying to those idiots a girl i met said the same theyre saying about rolex and she knows fuck all   its just snowflake contrarianism and they probably praise grand seiko garbage

  modern lange blancpain and breguet dont really have any meaningful connection with their history or heritage
  looks good cant really talk shit about any of the luxury not that most of this general knows anything about luxury when theyre envious of people who can afford more than their garbage seikos casios and vostoks
  who cares they shit all over the shitters its like the retards who actually pay a grand for a laco  lmao
  
    all i see is some fuckeroony who is completely fucked making up bullshit    fuck me dead fuck me dead
  did you take that in front of a poster nice watch though
i fucking hate my life
  no i took it at the beach yesterday
  if you look at the real one the ceramic has a little bit of a curve to it and you can see more dimension in the bezel    also the pvd has a pretty distinct look most of the fakes are painted
  i was talking about the hands very obvious here for example        on the real watch the hands are bowed the same way a road is to make water run off it to the sides
  watch your own video at 1036    he says exactly what i said    its much easier to tell its a fake based on that rather than trying to see if the hands are flat or not the curvature is very slight
  this is a real one if that wasnt obvious
  man the state of these threads with brandfags being entirely incapable of evaluating watchmakers on any other bases is than perceived brand status ugh
anyone looking at the nusumo aka seiko mm200 im torn between calling it a shitter due to overpricing or a great series of watches that is unfortunately being used as scalping material by the usual faggots
  forgot pic
  tisell pilot
what should i buy with my upcoming inheritance im rocking a quartz tissot nato strap but i want one 1 true luxury watch it will only be a fraction of what i get     im thinking zenith either el primero or a pilot dont want to spend so much like submariner money     dont want something too complex and must have in house movement not spending inheritance money on a shitter
  so around the 5k range then if you want a solid three hander then look for an 114270 maybe a jlc master control date with the sector dial if you want a chronograph then take a look at the heritage 146 the one nitpick i have with it though is it doesnt hack unless im mistaken the jlc master control chrono is worth a look too
  upcoming inheritance
  fuck off you smelly paki cunt
  yeah or maybe a bit more 114270 looks nice but i think i want something a bit less plain i guess not really like a dress watch even though that isnt one i think the el primero or pilot type 20 says more what im after was also thinking a moonwatch     i feel like zenith is better value for money than jlc especially if you get the history of the el primero movement     desu from what i have seen online pic related is the one i like the most but itll be too expensive       the body has been laid to rest the estate is in the process of being distributed with lawyers etc
  the modern fifty fathoms would be nice if it wasnt so fucking huge
  nice rep its crazy how good reps are these days tempted to buy one myself for shits and giggles
  i went to a replica rolex authorized distributor and paid 8250 replica dollars it came with a replica box replica warranty card and a replica insurance appraisal    they even put me on the replica mailing list and i got the replica winter 2018 rolex catalog in the mail    pretty crazy
  45mm isnt that big
  
  if you dress appropriately nobody will ever know its fake especially qt gold digging cunts in the club     it also looks great as keeps time perfectly
  but you cant lie to yourself
  my dad is one he has a genuine sub which he kept in his drawer and wears a good rep whenever he goes outside when i asked him about this weird behaviour he said he did this to maintain the resale value of the rolex in his mind he commits no crime wearing a fake because he actually owns the real thing
  finishing is still trash you dumb gimp
  how do its the best finishing you can get at that price point
anyone know how many submariners are made per year  who here limited edition squad 1 of 2500 for these two
  nice baseddor
  whats the point of having something and not using it you might as well dont have it in the first place    and if you buy consumer goods as investments why would you wear a fake its as if you invest in gold and then wear fake stuff on your neck mr t style because you have 4kg of gold to your name on the national bank vault
  just copped dont fail me now
  he bought the shitty ones
  2500   limited edition
  limited edition shitters
is it safe to get seikos on ebay are fakes common on there the particular watch in after costs 1100aud at the seiko shop but there is some dude selling one for 300 starting bid or 850 buy it now    looking through his feedback he seems to sell a lot of older /g/ stuff and looks like he has an omega seamaster sold    the seiko watch is marked as new never worn could it be he just bought it and changed his mind
  i will be soon a long time as its not even shipped from buyee yet boi
  i went to a seiko ad with every intention to buy the mm200 until i put it on my wrist     seiko plz make a more normal sized 40mm version i beg of you
  pale ale  rolex  solid taste     i worked on their new malting plant pretty awesome brewery
  the problem with the 6159 style models are overly long lugtolug length and lack of case curvature to make it conform to wristlet arms you should see the gaudy and very american mm600 and mm10000 theyre even worse than the 200 and 300 only the grand seiko divers pic related are somewhat realistically sized in this aspect if you want a similar case shape but its easily pushing 8k burgerpesos and you will still be mocked by tryhard muh cosc fags on the other hand the tuna style models wear much smaller despite their humongous diameters due to their lugtolug lengths being comparatively very short and on the bigger models the lugs are basically hidden under the case instead of extending out like the mms    t tuna/fa/g
  it really depends on the seller my rule of thumb is usually if the guy has less than 99 positive feedback with 1000 transactions then its most likely a shitter of course a seller with 988 could have just had a stroke of bad luck and got that total rep only due to several dramas with petty buyers/scammers but in general its preferable to deal with dramafree sellers also what model are you looking at creationwatches out of singapore is safe and a lot of the buyfags from watchuseek etc rely on them for asiaonly seikos
  yes
a reminder
people think fake seikos are a thing     lmao
  who the fuck has ever bought a fake seiko  i get fake rolex and tudor but why bother with a seiko
  this looks okay though the lugs are designed to hug the periphery of your wrist after all
  this looks okay
just got my speedy a little over a fortnight ago still in love with it thinking about getting a seiko tuna so i have a watch that i can wear in the water and then im fucking done
also does anyone know a good site for leather straps i want to get a racing strap for my speedmaster but im not sure whats good in terms of quality
  with those watches do you leave the chronos stationary when not timing anything or do you just let them continuously run
gonna buy a traditional handmade hungarian pocket knife /wt/ the question is what shape     one option has a handle shape of say the buck 110 the other the more traditional hungarian curved handle shape like pic     only it would have elk antler handles with brass opinions
  only two watches impossible
  why would you spend this much on a seiko just save for a speedmaster or seamaster
  so yeah what i saw for sale kinda looks like this     i hope /wt/ is still into foldingwatches like back on /g/
  a lot of seikofags  me included  are absolutely turned off by swiss watches
  poorfag mentality
also post traditional knives from your region
  id rather have a 5000 grand seiko or 2000 tuna shitter than a speedy or seamaster
  i think the speedmaster will be my next watch to buy after my current sarb033 has run its time and i have 5k to blow
  another retard bites the dust
  ello guvna you got a loicence for that
coppernot 
  people with a mechanical background often have an appreciation for japans ability to deliver goods equal or superior to the europeans at a lower price  the oftenmade comparison to the 80s/90s automobile industry is apt
  its a timex on a tasteful stealthy nato  i say cop since it shouldnt be expensive at all
  you mean weebs on an anime board will do anything to suck from the dick of japanese culture
  you need to get out more there are many industries the japs have taken over with better products at lower prices
  ebay has really good buyer protection even if the seller says no returns if you dont like your product theyll just give you back your money no questions asked
  congratulations on being happy wasting your money on shitters instead of buying something with actual quality     its like saying youre happier spending 70000 on a hyundai genesis when you can get a mercedes or bmw with much better quality features and brand name for a bit more money       japanese watches are mass produced garbage their best stuff grand seiko doesnt hold a candle to the best swiss watches    so your post is load of fucking made up weeb trash that poorfags delude themselves with to cope
  this is true some cunt of a buyer just recently fucked me over this way
  japanese watches are mass produced garbage  this is what people said about swiss watches before they took over the industry
  man the state of these threads with virgin poorfags whining because no one cares about their shitters ugh
  its poorfags and then other poorfags complaining that they arent saving 5 grand for a rolex like them usually the most expensive watch you ever see in /wt/ is a speedmaster and then maybe 1 person with a sub this isnt a luxury watch forum everyone is gonna have shitters also most people dont want a 1 or 2 watch collection if they like watches so even if they have a nice piece they are gonna have 5 other shitters
  youre confusing poorfags with people who simply dont think spending 5 grand on a watch is a good idea for example ive got 20k in cash just sitting on a shelf in my closet yet i dont have or want a sub  saving 5 grand for a rolex   imo if you need to save for a rolex you probably shouldnt get one what if you drop it or whack it on a doorframe or something
    ive convinced myself im different from the crowd im a sophisticated gentleman with unique taste thats why i prefer overpriced jap garbage
  for example ive got 20k in cash just sitting on a shelf in my closet  sitting on a shelf in my closet  i hope you know this just verifies youre poor
  new thread      
  overpriced  cheaper than the competition  youre not very good at this
  that one is disgusting and washed out the turquoise one is way better
  garbage seiko almost 6 grand  cheaper than the competition  so youre also dumb apart from poor
  thanks for the headsup ill try the tuna in the ad next but im rather worried about the height which seems to be an ill match with more formal attire
    your dad is a fucken moron m8 if youre really worried about resale value and dont even wear the piece why not keep those 8 grand in your pocket or the stockmarket for that matter
    they probably sell them as genuine more margin that way
  there are fake seikon and sekio 5s in the third world mostly they have a very rough chink clone of a 7000 series seiko
  fucking why though thats like making counterfeit 5 dollar bills why make something with a low profit margin
  see map
    most counterfeitted euro bills are 20 and 50 why not 200 and 500 because people tend to pay more attention to those same principle i think
i like my hoodies long but sometimes my hoodies but sometimes the size is too big around my waist or at the bottom  any suggestions on brands or what i could do
  for me it is the 3sixteen heavyweight hoodie the best fast food sandwich
it is normal to have this large separation in hair    i am starting growing my hair and it looks like this
  try not having shit genes next time
  yeah looks fine
take collagen and biotin to make it fuller you probably have a bad diet along with bad genes or on drugs eat omega 3s and plants with zinc massage scalp with biotin shampoo and get enough cardio that blood will flow to your roots some people just look better with short hair if it isnt full enough you can use minoxidil if you really have to but it wont fix genetics
  also i forgot to mention your hairs probably fine its just such a stark contrast against a pale scalp my hair turns blonde in the sun so you can either lighten your hair so its not as noticeable or get tanner
    the pic isnt me this here is me      so i just have to get a better diet and health in general right      the first photo isnt me but my part are a little red i shouldnt worry right
  donald my nigga is it you
  donald the duck
  yeah diet affects the way everything looks but your hairs fine dont buzz it or anything just use sulphatefree shampoo so it wont lose lustre your hair and scalp should be hydrated by its own natural oil but also not greasy overwashing hair can make it appear thinner than it is
  no this is very abnormal
  like you people never seen a natural hair part ffs
  ok thank you for your information also i use coconut oil every 2 weeks i can continue to use right        i already see but this looks like i will go bald
  looks normal if thin hair otherwise people dont really care doesnt look unhealthy    like the other anon said eat better and get fuller hair
  yeah just keep it off your scalp and rinse it out well because it can cause acne
  youve posted you stupif fucking hair in every hair thread and then started you own jesus fuck
    okay thank you guys      of course nobody reply me you cock sucker
does /fa/ still have a boner for rick owens
  yea that sounds hot as fuck

  more inspo
old pastbin    
  dont do it with a uniqlo one theyre surprisingly trash quality  i think its much cooler with just some decent quality sweater even if it has like stripes or some kind of textile pattern
w2c one of these
wish this wasnt so absurdly expensive and that it wasnt only in tiny japanese people sizes
where can i get custom patches
  centralxdogma used to make them but they dont show up on their site
  most tailors near military bases
  try to find hidden characters silkscreen patches theyre all white on black reigning champ champion reverse weave uniqlo muji all good blanks size up on jp brands
  what if i live in an eu country and dont know of any miljtary bases  what would be a good place to look   any good sites cant find em
  military bases dont exist in the eu  retard just look one up you communist anarchist faggot
  what about screen prints is their places you can send designs and they print them
  throwback to when i stole all those links and copypasted them onto r/streetwear for hundreds of upvotes
anyone have experience with boro patching
recently got this patch a while ago and love it im currently looking for some more to put in the front and sleeves i want to stay with the industrial/horrorish theme
  fuck ye street sects are sicc
  hell yeah i saw them live a while back for a kick off show for their tour probably my favorite live show i have seen in a long ass time their merch is rad and they run their own table which is always nice because you actually get to talk to the musicians after the performance
did this shit the other day first time experimenting with patches how did it turn out
how many people scam on grailed selling well replicated products     i feel like people that are scamming on accessories like totes and socks are making the most bank because barely anyone knows how to legit check them    needles vlone acw all these hype brands have really good reps and i feel the majority of these listings are fakes from scammers      
    scammed a guy for 925 and still trying to sell acw reps
  based on europe  based chinaman selling fake hyped trash as its overvalued and overinflated hype trash price
paypal always side with the customer hype shit is easy to replicate because is all the same banal shit anyway and if you buy them you deserve to be scammed
fuck off
hard mode no gopnik tier adidas i wanna see ellesse kappa sergio tacchini fila cerruti fiorucci diaspora lacoste etc post your trackies    this was a recent cop of mine from saks off fifth
diadora lmao autocorrect
is fiorucci sportswear    gf came back from soho with pic related and id never heard of them before  assumed they were a more high fashion type brand    gf sold separately
  your gf has the shoulders/hip ratio of a man
  gf  g    friendo i got bad news for you 
    gf not included in pic related learn to read
    apparently gf sold separately was too subtle for you retards thats obviously me not her
  fiorucci in the 80s was pretty much their equivalent of hypebeast clothing it was the brand to be seen in naturally this brand was in the line of fire with other designer brands with the 80s casual movement football hooligans pretty much looted anything that was wearable and considered high end that being said fiorucci jeans and sweatshirts were coveted pieces for any 80s casual
  also i can guarantee your girlfriend has a bepis
    thanks for the info thats really interesting ive got a soft spot for casual clothing si/cp etc because im from a city where the casual movement was huge surprised i hadnt heard of fiorucci now
  same here but for a different reason as an amerifag its a great way to look smart and polished without going for the american prep/frat boy look
i wonder what should people in their late 20s  early 30s dress like according to you  if you still wear streetwear or any hype shit you will look incredibly infantile like a manchild or a skater but were still too young to go full dadcore    i wear a lot of casual and retro items mainly curdoroy jackets adidas sneakers etc but no real flashy pieces or generally weird stuff for teens
  wrong youre only a zoomer if youre in youre early 20s or late teens anything else and youre a millennial stop trying to cramp our style gramps    but if you really must know a long sleeve vineyard vines t shirt with a  america eagle stretch fit jeans and a pair of new balances
whats up with all these insecure people making these threads   
has there ever been a worse ironic trend than this
  what rickandmorty or ugly sweaters

do you have a feminine penis 
how to wear suits every day without looking like an autist
  being absolutely ripped helps a lot
  become a lawyer
  find a job that requires you to wear a suit everyday or else dont
  this only way thread is over
  you get a job that requires a suit do not wear a fucking suit for no reason you will be known as the retarded autist everyone avoids
    what about like blazers/sport coats
  they have to be tailored you have to be in shape and have a job or position that makes sense with it
    
  be reviewbrah
wear quality suits that fits you  be comfortable wearing a suit  dont act like an autist
be a lawyer/medfag/politician/teacher/banker    t medfag who wears bizcaz daily
  you need to be in the more elite portion of your population to pull this off lets say top 15 everyone else is a tryhard
  lawyers are gay op become a doctor instead  you can wear suits on your clinic days
  same as above wear them if your job requires this kind of apparel or you have insane amounts of confidence in what you are doing im quite sure you dont
  teacher  what
  cuz every girl crazy bout a sharp dressed man
never wear vests    only wear a tie for actual formal occasions go tieless otherwise    no pocket square/handkerchief unless youre also wearing a tie    live or work downtown

  convert to hasidic judaism
  blazers and sports coats are casual wear you can wear them all day everyday

looking forward to buy a pair of perscripted sunglasses from glasses usa    those in house brand surely are cheaper but are they high quality    my experience with oakley is that they make their sunglasses tough and the lens are clean    should i buy the cheaper 100 sunglasses or just buy the 150 brand one
bump
how do i slightly distress my jeans without looking like a try hard
  do stuff in them

  sleep in them no lie
get blackout drunk in them often enough and youll wake up with them torn to shit
  by wearing them champ
  do squats in them
  braaaaaap
      right there thats all you need
tear them enough to open holes and show some threads but not enough to show skin however these threads will eventually tear after frequent use and your skin will eventually show so do this for the cheaper brands only
  practice backflips or whatever on pavement   powerslides
does anyone else like wearing these without socks and listening to the feet farts b

whats your favourite fashion show of all time    also wheres the best place to view full shows preferably video
rip   the fags here arent into fashion they just claim to and shit on normies   this board is fucking shit
    and shes less than 40 imagine what shell do at 70 queen iris
  my favorite shows are dior fall 2000 couture alexander mcqueens highland rape and mcqueens voss    most shows can be found on vogue or youtube
  where can i go to discuss fashion shows anon
what to appreciate on those shows sometimes pirotecnic clothes are unwearable even in home
  do you go to art galleries and rate the works based on howd they fit into your living room
  want to add on what  said    often they contain ideas that are very applicable to wearable fashion like colour combination fabrics cuts etc even if they are exaggerated in the shows the reason they are so over the top is i think anyways both to make the ideas clearer and to simply make sure you can see everything
  kids are not allowed to post here please go back to school and learn reading comprehension
  is your opinion right  i can get your main idea anything to add
  i havent been keeping up with shows the last year or so has their been anything especially exciting ive missed i kinda stopped watching because everything had seemed pretty stagnant
      haute couture means complete freedom of creation is pure art not contrive by wearability or practicality    pret a porter means it is contrive by practicality and usability it literally means ready to wear
  there is freedom in ready to wear see for example thom browne or watanabes rtw haute couture is a highly regulated term couturiers are appointed and some designers are invited to make a show as a guest member couture means specifically    each couture house must design madetoorder garments for private clients the process must require one or more fittings  a couture house must have a atelier in paris and employ at least fifteen staff members fulltime  each house must employ a minimum of twenty fulltime technical people in at least one atelier location  lastly a haute couture house must present a couture collection of at least fifty original designs to the public every fashion season the collection must include both evening and daytime garments    source 
  kim jones has a very fresh take on dior wonder if the space/futuristic theme is going to get bigger love elon great to see his influence in fashion aswell    ss19 womens dries was brilliant as usual if dries was a woman hed definitely be more hip baffles me how he still seems to be unnoticed in sort of the more mainstream fashion culture  i guess his clothing is too much for your average person and the lack of branding definitely doesnt help during these times     alyx is fresh and matthew has a nice take on modern streetwear very cool    clare is great at givenchy i guess if you want a phoebe replacement  shes not a bad choice    i liked isabel benenato ss19 to me its like a combination of rick and yohji vibes but with a lot less volume very wearable for a runway very boring though in real life itd look great    speaking of rick womens babel was probably one of my favorite shows ever if someone played warcraft its like burning legion or something similar in real life great vibes very unwearable though set was nice    demna is doing a great job at both houses i liked the little bit more elegant take on balenciaga while vetements still gives you that great trashy look the babushkalooks in fw18 are probably my favourite thing right now wonder if the mainstream will catch it i can only afford to buy a few nice pieces a year so its always nice when you see something really inspiring on the runway and you can do the same look with thrifting or cheaper alternatives     meunier  burton however are imo the best right now love the gothic elements they incorporate                 
  gucci f/w18  detailed garments in old world european style as in applique sequins and brocade layered over and under the 1970s truly baroque in its indulgence a feast for anyone with an eye for design the conceit for the medical stage was clever as well alessandro remarking theres a clinical clarity about what i am doing i was thinking of a space that represents the creative act i wanted to represent the lab i have in my head its physical work like a surgeons    balenciaga s/s19  clothes rather boring until the second half but the set was incredible very interesting models as well a huge departure from the conventional faces    ackermann s/s19  he has been improving with every collection this was easily my favorite from him so far  dries s/s19  sublime deployment of a panton print    lemaire s/s19  fucking big suits in in sometimes vibrant patterns fisherman sandals an unabashed embrace of the 1980s with pleats doublebreasts and all    i dunno there is something exciting every season you have to put effort into looking
      thank you fagots really lost in this shit is so hard to learn when nobody give real hints definitions or examples  currently looking for change my whole closet to fit my exskinny body  what ive learned is fashion shows are not to me i will continue with instafashioners maybe next time
  babel was a spectacular show it made me wonder how rick will plan his funeral either that or he and lamy are crafting ceremonies for their deaths together
  yeah just my opinion also as an example of the exaggerating if a designer wants you to mix formal and causal they would go to the extremes of both something like a black tie shirt and a tracksuit cut like a suit jacket shity example but whatever no one wants you to wear this but they do want you to play with different levels of formality    and some designers/brands do shows more focused on clothes instead of art if that makes sense these shows are more wearable and you can find most of the items in stores most shows reflect the current and upcoming trends in fashion     nothing more to add unless you want me to clarify something
  no trouble dont let anyone give you grief for not being into high fashion its fine to just want to dress to a certain level the art is for a different audience
i mostly watch couture shows tbqh what do you fags think of the schiaparelli collections im not really feeling the recent ones
 and some designers/brands do shows more focused on clothes instead of art  who events brands victoria secrets make male slips lol
alexander mcqueen voss 2001 went pretty hard
dont know if i could pick just one but yohji ss99 always comes to mind other favorites include mcqueen ss99 chalayan ss01 helmut lang aw98 cdg fw17 and thom browne fw17
  ha ive never thought about his funeral thats actually going to be great cant wait lamy might actually go soon doesnt seem to care too much about her health so maybe we will only have to wait like 10 years wonder if rick will get a new companion thats going to be an interesting choice as well
runway threads are back   does this signal the revival of this board
  no just a dying breath
  designers and brands that focus more on wearable clothes instead of art outnumber the latter are you certain you did not misread the sentence if we are talking about menswear artistic fashion is rare not deeply familiar with womens wear but i would suppose its the same customer demand for wearable clothes alone dictates runway shows with wearable clothes would outnumber art shows    just a few random examples for menswear oliver spencer lanvin hermes burberry band of outsiders white mountaineering  white mountaineering may be adventurous with prints compared to the rest of those examples but they dont send anything down the runway you couldnt wear on the street
  i love you  nohomo
  im just saying if you look at these pictures     compared to this    the dior one is way more wearable even if you wouldnt see it on the streets and many shows are even more wearable cant be bothered to find pics now also listen to       no problem and thats completely ok maybe youll come back and enjoy an later maybe you wont i think i like em because because they mix two things i like fashion and art       not that anon and dont have anything more to say but thanks for the great response      one can always dream      the helmut lang aw98 has very interesting model choices
  the helmut lang aw98 has very interesting model choices  one of my favorite things about helmut was always his model choices kirsten owen is my favorite of his regulars
this years victorias secrash was fun to watch
  hba gets alot of bad reputation based on their ready to wear stuff not all of which is bad but when they were around their runway stuff was fantastic i made a prediction a few years ago on this board that he would work at helmut lang and it turned out i was right    i dont have detailed knowledge of shows where i can match the name of a season to what it looks like in my head i liked that yohji show where all of the models had bruise/cut makeup
  also cdgh 17ss  i made the mistake of not buying the wool jeans or whatever they are when they were on sale and now i cant find them anywhere
  thats one of the worst feels when you know a collection is special but for some reason or another you cant or didnt cop some stuff shows up on ebay grailed or yoox but a lot of other items are more or less lost forever
  nowhere
lame answer but helmut lang fw98 sticks out for how influential it was
  walks towards you
  seems very hard to find such places which is really weird considering how big the business is most people who say theyre into fashion will mostly focus on wearable clothing and they dont seem to have any interest in the shows still it seems weird that there isnt even some subreddit that would be focused on high fashion and be even little bit active    for me the way to process fashion shows is to buy some fashion magazines they feature a lot of pieces youve seen on the runway and feature interesting interviews ive also been reading some reviews but i still dont know enough websites like this some basic ones but ones that i like checking out are vogue theyre extremely quick to upload shows and the shots are good and the cut     if you can find real life friends who are interested in the subject thats great personally havent even the most fashion savvy people i know dont really care about the shows    but yeah if anyone has more websites/whatever that feature reviews etc link pls

be confident and not insecure something which you already failed at by making this thread
why the fuck would you purchase something without knowing how or not being confident enough to wear them
anon kun why are you wearing pajama pants in the mcdonalds
at best you do something like the left fit
doc martensleather jacket
should have got some that are the correct length for your legs then you could have worn them as trews
2 elastane   78 polyester  20 viscose  7000  you overpaid shit cost probably 250 to produce
only punks and anarchists wear those in my country      dont do gay shit like this
  wear them with black boots chelseas cuban heels penny loafers etc no brown shoes your palette is black white and grey
dont have them above your ankle and keep them kinda baggy
  just follow this anything else you attempt you will fail since you had to create this thread just thank the other anon
pajamas are for bed time
if your too much of a faggot to wear them with confidence just make them the statement piece of your fit keep the top and jacket very simple and monochromatic and wear a simple pair of sneakers make sure they are designer so when sneakerniggers bully you over your pants at least they will admire your shoes
ok faggy boys  roast me big time
you look chink

what does the modern day basic bitch look like now
  champion  fila
this is the norm where i live except theyre not wearing boots because its hot and the slacks are jeans rompers are also popular here these or kpop look
  same but no crop top because they gained weight from the starbeetus and all the girls here have vans or adidas not boots
  hey i dress like this where do you live im in montreal
basic bitch vs art hoe   go
  and then the women who dont wear those wear clothes like these or artsy clothes theyre the ones usually studying in expensive universities      southeast asia
  those black vans with the white stripe
they also love the color mustard yellow on crop tops      ding ding ding
by rompers this is what i mean it looks like shit they like to put plain shirt underneath
  kpop look  what is that
  let me guess the philippines
  more like brandy melville clones
  this one in particular is not amazing but once you get one in good quality and good pattern they are great what are you on about
vans old skools    light wash jeans    some highcropped striped tshirt

  doesnt matter if they are hot
who cares

i dont think these threads are fair since men dress far more lazy than women and arent shamed for it as often here now ill go back to r/feminism
  i am a pretty non judgmental person especially when considering negative assumptions but there is one fucking thing there is absolute zero chance of me putting up with   leggings outside of gym/home
  tattoos   heavy makeup with dark lipstick  band tee  ripped jeans   bright colored hair   thick rimmed glasses     basic bitches come in disguise now many former indicators that a girl may have been involved with some kind of offbeat fringe culture now mean nothing with the advent of the internet style is no longer regional or indicative of any substance anyone someone wants to be for a day is only a click away stacies now dress like ophelias judging from many of these girls appearance youd expect them to laid back interesting and exude some form of depth beyond what youd find in girls dressed like   but its no longer true theyre the same person they dressed like  a mere few months ago     alternative is the new normal everyone feels like a special snowflake but only within the bounds of normalcy they see enough others do so they follow theres no substance or meaning behind what they do just an immitation of a few insta or tumblr pages they viewed while high

  when you realize the young woman in the joy division tee has never actually listened to the band but knows it is like an 80s old school retro thing and a fashion shirt or whatever    the sad part is that the girl is not wrong in a sense in her sense    my point is that an element or degree of what is at the heart of the insta / imitation is also right there in anyone that ever wore one of those joy division shirts right from day one     theres a thread on here about if you can wear indian feathers if you find out you are only 1/16th native through some ancestry website it is all the same bullshit larping     i dont know maybe kids wearing nirvana shirts never knew a time when kurt cobain was alive but in the end so what some people are just better at hiding the fact they are a copy of a copy of a copy

hey rocky fan here im going to missouri or philadelphia for christmas so i want to get my set complete before that happens i have rockys leather jacket done his running gear done but i dont have his boxing gear done i dont know the shoe brand and the boxing trunks they dont make anymore everlast white trunks with red stripe anywhere i can find and buy a pair thanks
  should be able to make something close with this    i think his boxing boots are nike but i dont know of any company that makes boxing/wrestling boots that high anymore
  just out of curiosity which gloves did you get    these are the ones he wore with the everlast white/red trunks i like them because they are made by a tiny family owned company and the quality is super good but nobody knows them these days
  i just learned the boxing boots are everlast as well thanks for the link though
  i got everlast gloves since that is what stallone wore casanova is the same company that makes it thanks though

  buhbuhbuhbuhbasic  one  nothing wrong with me  two
  respect but they look slightly dirty/beat up
  well yeah i wear them till theyre falling apart then get a new pair
  i meant to say they look better slightly beat up my dumbass just forgot to write the word in apologies
  is this wavy or nah
how to look more intimidating    is this autistic yes it is fuck off and answer my question
dont be gay
  well to borrow a line of thought from heidegger taking up any identity will require authentically resolving yourself upon it as a possibility for your being then going about your daily projects as that person does    in other words you need to understand what intimidating people are and you need to do everything you do as that possibility of yourself what are intimidating people like well theyre usually a bit misanthropic or disgruntled they have reasons for that beyond the fact that they think its cool and theyre usually physically imposing    the upshot of this is a question is this even a possibility for you maybe if youre doing it because you genuinely see it as a possibility for yourself that youre living out but it sure sounds like youre doing it to get something maybe respect or intrigue if thats how you see it then youll never be intimidating you might be needy or scary though again this is all speculation what i mean to say is that being a sort of person isnt just a matter of adopting their style its everything
user was fucked off so he cannot answer the question
  its hard to look more intimidating it is mostly attitude how you carry yourself and stance if you dont have those naturally you wont easily get them they are innate clothing will just make you look like a fucking poser
  you have to live it which is why i stopped buying sleezecore clothes i dont drink or do drugs and im horrifyingly honest even though i am a salesperson i look like im wearing a costume because i dont manifest correctly in those clothes
  ok thats an answer i didnt expect but thanks it was a good read funny enough people already see me as intimidating because of the reasons you listed but the reasoning behind my question is pretty simple i work as security and want people to be intimitaded so they wont try stupid shit on me      i know those are things im already working on mostly its having a wide frame and wearing big jackets for example improve that
  exactly the idea you are as you live its because we see this so often in grieving people or addicts or whatever other subculture and we act like the clothes make the man but the reality is that the man/woman makes the clothes how many people could dress like hunter s thompson and look appropriate only people who live like he did really it really is fascinating to think about how people gravitate toward fashions based on how theyre currently living      i work as security and want people to be intimitaded so they wont try stupid shit on me    yeah man it honestly sounds like youve got it down just trust yourself and as dumb as it sounds believe who you want to be the more you embrace it the more youll be perceived as you want to be perceived
  gain mass
  do ssgomad    for real though lift weights and do cardio if you can lift 1/2/3/4 and jump rope as quick as you can for five minutes and not be too exerted go practice martial arts in addition to that  yes i did pull those preconditions for martial arts almost straight from my arse    any money you have earmarked towards intimidating clothes and accessories should go towards a gym membership training things you need for the gym etc
figure thing by yourself stop waiting to get everything already cooked stop being a fucking cuckhold and live your life to the fullest  then maybe you will but you are a wimpy faggot
work out your shoulders upper chest and back till you have a stronger vtaper     grow you hair out longer and slick it back or take the buzzpill
  first you need to be tall    if youre not tall youd definitely need a naturally intimidating face/expression like that guy varga    then you can focus on gaining a somewhat ripped body with a nice v shape and strong arms    clothing is not that important just dont dress like a clown

how do i get this sort of texture any recommended products i already blowdry but the path i can think to take from here is just to grow my hair out
ive got hair very similar to this currently very small cause of haircut when it grows out     this is my first post here because i never really bothered with this board for some reason i starting fucking my hair when i was 18 something used a hair dryer with hair wax daily to get up daily leave weekends ive stopped after two years and this is what it looks pretty much     should i just stay with the downstraighthair dont know what you call the style or is the producthair better
  your hair is not similar youre delusional
thinking of kysing myself
  why do you think so
hi girls are there any loweffort ways i can put my hair up all i know how to do is a ponytail    i mean and a bun but those dont look too good when your hair is thick and doesnt bend well
  half ponytail also be my bf
  dye it light blonde and it wont show
you dont you need naturally wavy hair and then conditioner and a lot of hair spray the sticky needs to honestly be changed to just say work with what you have and dont try to imitate who you cannot be
keep growing or cut only about 1 year of growth
  who the fuck could tell you if you censor your face idiot its the one important thing to consider here
  wear a ponytail    please post results also
  buzzcut bro
  that looks some terrific hair ive always wanted that kind what does /fa/ rate this

is there any way i can control dandruff while still keeping my hairs natural oils in it ive been going shampooless for a while but i realized my dandruff was getting worse now im using baking powder and apple cider vinegar but that has the same oilstripping effect as shampoo does
    way too try hard just do a top bun pony tail or get cut your hair shorter so you dont have that problem
  stay with the bieber look or get a normal hair cut
  why would you want gay hair
  so damage your hair to make it better sounds like a great short term solution but i hope hes not dumb enough to do this

what do i ask for to get this exact haircut i have pretty similar hair should i just take the picture in
hi i have naturally very curly dry afroish type hair since bleaching my hair its become more noodley and right after hopping out of the shower and giving it a bit of a dry it looks like pic related which is me and my hair now the problem is when it dries up my hair begins to stick out either sideways or upwards and gets dry and curly     is there anything i can use to keep it looking like id just hopped out of the shower while also maintaining volume
tips on identifying hair type ie oily dry thick hard etc im sick of buying shampoos only to find that they dont work for my hair
  take this exact picture in and ask for this exact haircut
what the fuck do i do with my asian hair /a/     what are some good styles/cuts that look good without the use of any shitty product
tfw bald
  i would cut it to ear length but its up to you
  it looks good
    what a faggot
  only wash your hair once a monthwashing is taking all the oils out but when you shower always wet your hair and dont dry it with towels it will make your hair look like straw so air dry     dude with thick long wavy hair
  yes
how do i into dunkirkcore
  stop right there citizen
it is normal to have this large separation in hair    i am starting growing my hair and it looks like this
  wash your scalp with warm water and massage it gently like when you shampoo the warm water will strip the dirt and particles and the excess of sebum then brush very well your hair you need to homogenize those natural oils do this maybe twice a week warm water can dry your scalp good luck
anyone here use moroccanoil how is it for curly hair
  use hair product but dont shampoo it out just rinse with water only then air dry
  it happens when your hair gets long and heavy and pulls further away and you never change your part my hair part hasnt changed for like a year and now its almost impossible to change it
  if your dandruff is fungal like most peoplesits yellowish and flakes then keeping the oils only makes it worse you need to add in a chemical that kills fungus like zinc pyrithrione ketoconazole coal tar etc problem is most of these things also have harsh stripping chemicals because the priority is to kill the fungus causing dandruff and that includes removing all the oils that it feeds on in addition to killing it     baking powder will just kill your hair stop using it you can try using mct oil on your scalp after you shower because it doesnt feed the dandruff fungus and will keep your scalp from releasing too much sebum
  does this include using conditioner if i dont use conditioner in my hair it ends up with a lot of knots which is annoying
  look up david bowies hairstyle throughout 2001 hes pretty much otacon
  so i should change the part every some months
  you could do a half bun
how do i add texture/volume my hair is extremely fine and falls flat almost immediately after i put product in only tried cheap supermarket brands so far though any product recs or haircut advice would be appreciated
guys i need some cool half length hair cuts for men post some of that twink asian shit you guys love so much im going to get my haircut tomorrow and need something to show to that lady
god i hate having fucking curly 3b hair the amount of effort you have to put into it for it to not just dry out and frizz into shit is crazy its that or it just falls flat because of the pure weight and looks like shit
i lvie in japan and all the barbers just want to either do whatthefuckever and send me off or give me some anime jpop thing    send help
        do yourself a favor and stop smoking weed man not even joking
  you have great hair im on a journey to this length right now and look like a complete asshole very jealous
  finasteride
  i have the same shitty hair genetics try dry shampoo after not washing your hair for a day or two play around with shampoos to find one that works with your hair most likely some variant of volumizing and lastly but most importantly get your blowdrying sequence on point by getting a round brush some good prestyler like mousse or a tonic and try waxes/clays for styling hairspray is also mandatory with this type of hair if you want anything to last for longer than an hour cant guarantee that these things will allow you to reach your ideal but they should at least get you on your way
  it doesnt have to be balding but can also be maturing if it gets more intense get on hair growth shit if you fear fin wait for brotzu or get morrf 5 from ebay if you dont wanna use finpoomin or fin get on minox at least     dont stress now if you want to take action now stop smoking fapping take cold showers and dermaroll
  yes also blond dye on males is thicc gay and will be on the cope scale between cheap turkish hair transplants and toup hair systems
  yeah alternate sides and middle every month idk how because ive been struggling youre supposed to wet it and comb it to a side and somehow get it to dry and hold that position but good luck with long ass hair i cant do it with medium length
  i dont smoke im just a sadboi
going in for a hair cut tomorrow i wanna get this look but my hair is frizzy and wavy i use conditioner and only shampoo once a week it helps a little but not alot
  nice color though
  protein mask/shampoo  then  volumizing powder/dry shampoo on roots  then  whatever product you use
  thanks
ordered fin got minox 5 and biotin shampoo not going fucking bald at 24 no fucking way not without a fight
used conditioner and occasional tea tree oil and my hair immediately improved significantly my dry scalp hs been nigheliminated and my curls no longer turn into a complete jewfro unfortunately the last time i added some i added too much and it got oily as shit instead whoops  that aside can someone suggest a styling for this amount of hair for reference my forehead is a bit on the large side of average      without knowing what your face looks like i have to say your hair looks pretty damn pretty great color id imagine itd look great long which partially eliminates the need for texture/volume but apparently most people arent fans of long hair
  i forgot my photo and it turns out that my mobile network is banned from posting images whoops
  fuck off
  please fuck me
  eggman gone latino
what colour is this
what should i do w/ my hair
  cumskin
  why does ur face point that way
  bottom jaw misaligned a bit  could get surgery but cant afford atm hahaha
  your hair looks fine as it is tho i like it
  tyvm3
  i think your hair looks really good im not expert tho stache is questionable to me tho
  what colour is this
  blonde
  looks like tom cruise
  which shade
  gay
  didnt notice it until he pointed it out like your style my man
  please shave oh my goodness
  sea salt spray 3
  please get this cut and post pics
  sorry i am asexual
  this
  or this
not interested in this particularly but just as an example how would you possibly wake up in the morning get out of the shower and make your hair just as perfectly groomed as when the barber/stylist does if they even can if you have something complicated like this    hair is so finnicky and unpredictable i dont see how anyone maintains a consistent look whatsoever unless they go to the stylist everyday
sorry for retarded autistic face  what the fuck do i do with it do i let it grow i live in russia so i think ill be fighting people because of it  also i swear im not underage
  blowdry with a diffuser and a heat protectant i would say also use some leavein stuff for your hair and try cowashing eh and try using an conditioner against dry hair   i have a similiar hair structure with thinner hair i found that it looks best when i let it airdry since i havent used a blowdryer in years with a leavein containing mapleoil also a bit of seasalt spray for texture but my hair is shorter and quite damaged from years of bad treatment especially the front part
best shampoo and conditioner for thick hair with dandruff and sensitive scalp
  dont listen these faggots dont shave that stache is amazing
  god i want that hair
why does hair thin    im not losing hair    the circumference of the strand is literally shrinking
  its the precursor to losing it your follicles are receiving less blood and thus less nutrients massage scalp/dermaroll vitamin d and minoxidil finn if you start to notice worrisome shedding like i did
what should i do i feel like the sides are at a quite awkward length should i grow them out or get a trim
  i think for the sides to be that length the top has to be significantly longer get the sides tapered and then grow it out from there
  dawwww thanks anon
care and maintenance reccomendations for long curly hair
hairline is receding hair is thinning at the front my hair looks like shit ive been my own barber for years now since i only shave my hair to a short short buzzcut my scalp is fucked and even at small lenght i get dandruff out the ass and its itchy ive never been into haircare what should i do where should i start any cheapo options or should i even bother with the hairline receding and all and just go bald
how bad does it look
  based uncle scump
  you look both like a 40year old and a cute teenager  make it more curly
  its okay we can just cuddle then
current hair length keep growing the front and taper the back
i just got this done  is there any way to salvage it
  use a sea salt spray
what can i do with this shit to make me look better
  protein mask and leave in conditioner on everything below shoulder length    very handsome post penis
wanna get a haircut soon looking for inspiration i usually go with this style i wouldnt mind asking for it again but im also looking for some new suggestions you can see my hair is starting to thin at age 22 fuck so maybe something to hide that would be good
  i guess it just decided to post my picture sideways
  if u get this haircut u r cordially invited to this pussy
  u look like a qt modern elvis
  nice hair man keep it going
what type of cut is this considered  i want something that can look clean but also be worn down like pic rel to look qt
hello /fa/ what are some masculine ways to put your hair up i cant wash it every day and reset the curls so i need to wear it up sometimes its not quite long enough for the high manbun and i dont really like that or the low pony tail either ive been goings with the half up with the added bonus of giving that mullet look from the front its easy enough because i pineapple at night too any other ways i should try
  stephen georg
what should i do to my hair i rarely use products and prefer to let it drape naturally
  you are the reason people dont browse this board
  whos rich enough to have a fucking mirror in their room
  take a picture from the corner i wanna know where your mirror is palced
should i keep growing my hair out more i want it to be long ish but i dont know when to stop
got my hair cut almost two months ago i finally did something other than growing a jewfro then doing a buzzcut but the barber left it too long on top    should i keep going with this same style just a lot shorter on top but keeping it curly and then obviously very short on the sides    pic is from 10 minutes ago
  beard looks good keep try using some light oil like argan oil in your hair to give it more weight and pull out some of the curl
  is it normal to have multiple ones i have like three
  if youre fit keep growing or maintain if not cut to ear level      no idea buzz it or at least shorten it    looks bad undercut    wish you didnt dye it makes it fucboy tier shampoo less and theres conditioners that leave it with a wet look without being crinkly      looks less bad here but it doesnt fit you you look like a middle schooler girl     grow it or leave it i like it    lmao we have similar hair when mine is extremely unkept undercut bruv or buzz buzz would suit you well     beautiful keep it like that    its fine    cut to shoulder length lol    buzz bro that shit is fucked    dont do man buns if youre fat anon    you can if you want to look more like a trap    gooncore i personally would buzz it and leave that cool beard current your head looks big as fuck
  i dont know how to tell you this but every home built post2010 in australia has a closet/wardrobe mirror in the bedroom      this is my rooms layout       wish you didnt dye it    even worse i bleached it half of my head is now dead hair
what fucking haircut should i get guys i never cared for this shit before
im really fucking bored of my hairstyle rn so i wanna grow my hair out longer in hopes of being a better soi boi    any suggestions you think would look cute on me
  anything tbqh
  mine is a similar length but the shape is much worse what do you do for maintenance how often do you get it cut
whats everyones opinion on men dying their hair anything other then blonde i went bleach blonde awhile back and had a lot of compliments but wanted to try other colours like a silver lilac but would this be too homo      pic related colour i wanted
  you look russian so buzzcut is my first recommendation not too short maybe die it blond
  he will look like a skinhead if he shaves it off
  you look like ron jeremys son why are you sad if your dad has lots of porn money
  please go /fit/ you would look like jake gyllenhaal
      it is blonde dark blond and i look retarded buzzcut    this
  based
what to do cut keep growing
just shave it senpai and wear a cap imo an easy but good look if you have a good head shape that is
i feel like a faggor for asking but what should i use to make my hair curly  i have thick poofy hair not curly not straight just thick and poofy
  senpai
i was wondering if anyone here knows where i could purchase a jacket of a similar cut/look to the one in the pic i have seen some womens bomber jackets with a similar vibe but not mens
  i believe hugo boss makes similar jackets   also 1488
  military surplus store maybe
ask knoch
  they look beautiful    sad that we lost the war

who wore it better
  neither  women are gay
  who wore what better
  man pornstars get younger every year
  this
do belts and suspenders work would it look dorky
  would it look dorky    yes
  belts and suspenders  get pants that you can trust
either do one or the other since suspenders are invalidated functionally by a belt and vice versa
  why would you want to wear both its like wearing multiple watches
  my great grandpa did that hes dead now
ive only seen it done once and that was pro wrestling
is /r/femalefashionadvice the best place for women looking to improve in their style
r/femalefashionadvice     possibly the worst
  where should i go then
not unless you exclusively wear shapeless sacks and birkenstocks
  this is all you need
  i went on there once hoping to see qts in the waywt threads but 2 in 5 seemed to be a mtf tranny    whats the deal are there any qts on there
  yikes
  i dont see many trannies but its generally a lot of business casual chinks and women who could use a good 30lbs weight loss theyre way better dressed than anyone on this board though
  got any more like this
like mfa ffa isnt about fashion but is about dressing in an appropriate inoffensive manner  if you want to learn about actual fashion go to sf dead sz or other sf
  oh my
  i want to improve my style
the best subreddit for female fashion is unironically /r/malefashion
  for who trannies
  npccore
  im afraid to know how you dress
my bmi is probably a minimum of five points below the average ffa poster i go there for brand recommendations and to make myself feel better lol
how about you develop your own sense of style instead of asking basement dwellers on the internet 
  low iq
  individuality is unironically unattractive in women
    incel
  npc core is a crop top and yoga pants no women dress modestly in the west and the ones that do stand out
  where tf do you live
  yankeeland thats why everything they post is retarded
  america
  wow how can you get so wrong    just your opinion
i guess ill stick with the ffa since you guys clearly have no idea what youre talking about
  username looks like she would have nice feet
   i browse ffa and if you want to improve id go on the inspiration or specific themed threads the waywt and advice threads are usually garbage i try to sort them by best/top post but even then id stay away from them that or look at peoples outfits/post history before taking any advice alot of people on there are either incredibly basic fat or think putting a bunch of weird items together means theyre creative    pinterest can be pretty good like you can look for inspiration pull up articles from specific fashion publications and put a board together to help you build your aesthetic that and typing in what youre trying to style also pulls up alot of good suggestions put the current year in though so youre not getting stuff from 2008     instagram can be good but try looking at professional photographers stuff or if you follow any fashion/art bloggers or actual runway models otherwise its just a bunch of girls trying to look like the kardashians    youtube has alot of look books and hauls so thats another good source just use the same search terms youd use on pinterest    but thats the best ive got so far good luck
  only worse style for girls than this is ig thot
  this is exactly my aesthetic except that im male 90 of my wardrobe comes from muji and uniqlo
why are there so many asians on that sub
ffa has some good ideas but overall comes off very insecure to me and some of the recognized contributors/ mods seem pretty full of themselves sometimes i feel like the women there are larping as dudes like it makes them more intelligent that they enjoy the harsher mfa banter while also trying to micromanage users opinions in a really weird way women often say i wish i had good pockets in clothing as a pretty standard complaint bc a lot of womens clothes dont have them or have little nubby pockets you cant fit anything into the current woke backlash to this is to say pockets will ruin the line of pants muh tailoring/ the garment wouldnt be able to support them muh construction knowledge or the items you put in them i understand it must be annoying when people say the same things over and over in a forum you moderate but that doesnt justify the attitude i see on one hand there are enough omg pockets basic twee bitches parroting the pockets thing on the other hand an example is that it can be hard to find actual womens work pants with usable pockets i dont mean bizcaz but backroom work pants where i need somewhere to stick the keys razorblade and misc things i was holding onto before the fedex guy shoved all his packages at me  idk bc some posters are great but i kind of hate a lot of the other ones i will see if i can find all my hateful res tags of stupid shit the mods say
  pulled this from a waywt  her dress looks like there are a bunch of rainbow sperm swimming all over it
  oops forgot to attach pic
  ah yeah when something good comes from europe or something bad comes from america its the west  when something bad comes from europe its those yuropoor communist faggots
  america obviously he wishes western europe is as shitty as his country is
  why dont people ever consider body proportions when dressing up    like how do you not realise that a short shirt and high waisted pants will inevitably emphasize your belly
  body proportions even the skinnyfats and fatties get feminine looks wrong most of those fits would suit copypaste skinnies with 10/10 neoteny faces    eh that grandma gives a signal of what she needs
more girls should wear stuff like this    modern tradcore is in i say
  creep
    this shit pisses me off   not every woman wants to dress for your skirtstockingschoolgirl fetishes and you really shouldnt consider the things you get a rager over modest traditional proper as they really arent   not to mention the hypocrisy of most people suggesting such outfits calling those who disagree sluts for not adhering to their fantasies
  not the posters    that style looks good on a lot of girls though
  creep
op women are on tumblr go look there maybe try /r/malefashion ironically the best subreddit for female fashion
    fuck i love tradcore im really self conscious  family is avidly catholic so im used to modest fashion  my bf though is not trad in the slightest though so we dont match when were together on the town makes me a lil sad sometimes because itd be cool if we could match up styles but i got no problem with him wearing what he likes and is comfortable in usually jeans skater shoes and a hoodie    tho considering the backlash youre getting i dont know what to wear anymore when i go out
  i wear cute fully styled trad 1950s60s and my boyfriend is a chubby pinoy hypebeast fuccboi i think its better to be happy than look good together
    you both are chubby pinoy shitskins
    t all black cringecore wearer  try growing up maybe im not a fan of that style either since i think it is boring but after a while you need to grow out of your cringy shit
  shitskin uggo
  skirt and stocking isnt a schoolgirl fetish retard it is how every mature woman dresses maybe if you lived somewhere that wasnt a shithole you would notice that women can wear something else than jeans and a tshirt  trousers on women are for middle and lower class upper class women wear skirts and dresses
  t ann d rick owens femcel  if you stop labeling everyone who likes trad clothing as a creep you might one day lose your virginity
    creeps
      ok
  tthot
  sad opinion
  im from the great white north bucko  the true north not any chink city that is every big city or town along the us/can border
  pockets are retarded i have a giant fucking purse i can fit a mini fridge in and no one can tell me not to take it into a store
  can you at least give an example
  amen
im going to avoid tradcore because i dont want to attract creepy incels from 4chan
        im not a fucking weeb it just looks better than yoga pants and uggs everywhere
    cool me too just wear whatever     i posted what i would like to see more of         most girls just wear hoodies and dress like their oil rig worker bfs here up north
  just be mormon or something the fuck even is that
  its bad for me to know what men are attracted to  amazing attitude youre being handed free information on how to get things from men or just how they work and you incentivise the person letting you know to not do it
  women dont dress to attract men who havent left the house in over a month
  i dont agree wirh yoir statement but then you might aswell dress full fashion nova
aside from being expensive as fuck allegedly cruel to animals and basically a meme have they ever made anything you like
  nah i dont like polyester looking outdoorsy jackets im not a fucking mountainclimber  just give me a proper coat
i got their basic model a few years ago its good quality and very warm there are probably better options for the price though  i like their softshells too
  the junya and vetements stuff is the only thing i like so no canada goose itself has not designed anything i like the look of
being jobless through social incompetence is it effay
sounds more bizraeli

i want to dress like a classical european aristocrat but i dont know where to get the clothes
  where to cop cloak
the contemporary high end of the venitian carnival makes classical aristocratic clothing look like plebwear
  i dont want to dress like some eyes wide shut illuminati jew i just want to be a classical european nobleman like the op pic
  the costumes are more compelling and interesting than high fashion in my opinion i am of course talking from an artistic standpoint looking at it as conceptual art as is intended of high fashion
forgot second pic      are you legitimately autistic what the fuck do you think the european aristocracy is
  this thread is for european nobilitycore luciferian freemason illuminati kikes get out

can you guys help me to find the name for this north face jacket ive been searching a long time for it and you guys are my last shot    the guy on the right if it wasnt obvious
  ayyy i love this movie
   isnt it this one
  the movie is 20 years old now you dont think they still make that particular jacket right
  i know its an old movie but the jacket is perfect
  no the jacket does not have a hood and it has a black primary colour and gray shoulders and arms
should i grow a mustache or should i shave it
grow the staysh daddy
  thanks for advice also anyone else feel free to ask for your own advice
have you tried that length of stubble across your whole face regardless i would try growing it out and see if you like it
my fringe always curls on the left side but stays straight on the right side  how can i make it straight
  how long is it
  actually its the right side that curls not the left  but my right so your left if youre facing me
  if i pull it straight it goes just past my eyebrows  im doing a kinda 2 block / bowl cut kinda thing right now but as the day goes on my fringe kinda curls and clumps together
  you might just need to take a little bit of volume out
  it actually goes to about the bottom of my eye sorry im not in a very smart state of mind rn  thanks though ill keep that in mind next haircut i get
need general advice what do i do with my facial hair keep it at the same length ive been thinking about shaving off the neckbeard or even letting everything grow a bit more just to see what it would look like    ive got quite an angular face if that helps
  needs a trim around your neck for sure but id say give it a bit longer to see how well it comes in
  sorry if this is a stupid question but what areas do you mean when you say around the neck ive been trying to keep the neck the same length as everything else just becuase that looks best/uniform
  right where your beard ends so just above your adams apple needs a little clean up in my opinion so if you keep growing it wont look unkempt
  i see what you mean now yeah that would look better thanks for the advice
  definitely shave the neck look up where to shave to if you need to
    keep around a layer of short stubble its been empirically proven to be the most sexually arousing facial hair style yes really    anything longer than that is reddit clean shaven is cuccboi      also op the shampoo youre using is too harsh and drying out your hair get something without sulfites consider using a gentle conditioner only nopoo lite
  how do i get a bf who looks like this no homo

thoughts on this dress guide
  looks like what a typical construction worker would wear youre fucked if you work anything other than labor though ironic that pol thinks the guardian of the aryan race is limited to lifting cement blocks    t right winger
  mandatory white socks  kek

jesus christ how embarrassing  w2c formal jacket though
its not fair why can women wear anything and get away with it if i wore this jacket id look onions i should be able to wear a shearling and look cool when am i supposed to blossom it was foretold i would blossom
i dont know what youre talking about this girl looks stupid
  is this a photo of the famed 4channel administrator
when you wear it out its men who will call you faggot
women cant wear anything though you can look through femalefashionadvice to know how many poorly dressed ugly chinks in 400 cardigans there are
  its one of the better looking jackets i think you look onions not the jacket
its because of low expectations  same reason why black people and children can pretty much wear anything
huh onions are based
not a man/woman thing just an attractive/unattractive thing a good looking dude could easily pull off that jacket but if it makes you feel better believe what you want
that seems pretty basic and you are just an hormonal teenager
this year my company will host a 20s themed christmas party  apart from going straight gangster or dressing up as gatsby how can i impress my coworkers

going to the barbershop what to do
  keep your hair
  buzz  nice mustache by the way
take the buzzpill
skip the barber  by some clippers and buzz no guard
  you look like a 1970s prog rocker a 1980s serial killer or a 1990s pedophile
ask the barber to straight razor your throat
  why
  seek vengeance for the death of your father
  ask him to take a few inches off that nose lmao
  holy shit dude cut all that shit
    adam driver plz send autograph
  i got a honker but its not as big as it looks in the photo selfies make ur nose look bigger
buzz it keep the stache and stubble
rhinoplasty
  could be worse could be fat ginger with neckbear and weakest lip hair ever
  omg thats my hair right now  i keep missing appts cuz night owl
  comb hair
  buzz head  remove mustache
  stop eating stop smoking dumbfuck
  this but the opposite youd look like youd escaped a nazi concentration camp if you shaved everything
  actually yeah buzz the head keep the moustache
  those thre are the same thing
  gonna hijack your thread op fed up of my hair should i start straightening it again
  i dont see the problem here
  he has risen praise be
  problem is it looks like shit its dry and frizzy i overwash it i think i already use a surface free shampoo still dry as fuck
    no worries i have the same problem my shit is dry and frizzy but unlike you im balding
  only shampoo and condition every other day youre going to need to invest in some hair product if you want to help get rid of the dryness and frizzing     its a 10 is what i use its good for general stuff but you might want to get something specific to your hair type     perhaps go for a trim at a salon or place they cut womens hair the beautician can point you in the right direction
  you shouldnt have to wash more than 3 times a week just rinse it with plain water between if you need a refresher    why would you straighten it your hair isnt curly its wavy here and most people other than asian or nordic peoples have some amount of wavyness or curl
  nose is big keep your hair and mustache     keep your hair and goatee maybe use some product to combat frizz
  hairline is fucked should keep your hair anyway    jesus christ
how do i achieve this aesthetic
think youre better than you are  talk about vibes like theyre a real thing  thrift  smoke cigarettes for the look  get some shitty tattoos that have a lot of meaning  watch movies but over analyze them and think youre into film  listen to shitty indie music  kill self
  stop showering
one pierced nip is patrician
  doesnt this girl sell nudes lmao
bad aesthetic duded try something else
  ulgy cunt  nice tits
head too small for body  be born to a mom with high test
  most art hoes dress like white trash but with minimalist tattoos and basic knowledge about art indie music
  ah yes i love art indie music
  tosses her over the overpass
  attend a bernie rally
  move to a trailer park
  i guess dont wear a bra and have big tiddies that seems like the fastest way to garner this aesthetic
  not even an art hoe looks like trailer trash
just copy
  what who i want her nudes
  you just described this whole board eg just look at any grid thread and lots of guys on here have cigarettes and pretentious music and books as an accesoire
  she has both done
give up
  lmao i pointed that out before and no one commented on it  pretty sure it is just a lot of 20 year olds    if you are the type of person who thinks smoking is a good aesthetic/attractive you have issues usually the same people also carry knives around apparently
become a liberal

  what kind of jacket is sam wearing in that pic
  probably a zip up turtleneck bomber
  i tried looking for both turtleneck bomber and zip up turtleneck bomber but i only see people with turtleneck sweaters wearing bombers
      its just a windbreaker jacket   i have a simmilar one with the neck part raised
  tabis are just one of the fashion memes of the season
i have these you will never wear them outside of camping because the steel cleats you slide on tile and track leaves and dirt everywhere get normal tabis or steel toe noncleat tabis from japanzone and dont forget tabi socks
are you sangheilian
  probably only problem is a lot of the good stuff is made by margiela and its pretty inflated pricing imo
are silicone implants /fa/

why do i get more female attention putting my hair in a bun i dont buy into that played out man bun shit i was just in a hurry this morning i just cant comprehend why they are into it and im not just wishfullly thinking here
you attract blind people
  ive noticed something similar maybe it just makes one to stand out among the generic sidecuts/fades or something like that
  before i cut my hair all off i bunned that shite on the regular it looks neat and can nicely frame your face
  it gets more attention not necessarily female attention
what conditioner do you use general hair washing tips thread

  not being gay  missing out
i use dr bronners citrus rinse twice a week shit is so cash

  threads not going so well huh
ive been a pretty good looking kid all my life high cheekbones lean so a white tshirt and some cheap jeans and combat boots got me laid and made me seem fashionable just from sexiness i spent most of my life surfing or teaching and clothes never went beyond wetsuit or shorts for 99 of my waking hours    anyway i got sick gained over 180lbs in 3 years from the meds lack of exercise depression etc now i have a giant giant gut stretch marks im a fat piece of shit     i have been swimming everyday to lose weight im around 220 plus most fat in belly and thighs    i tried some asos jeans on at a friends today live with family in uk now relocated as my auntie is a gnr at a physical rehab facility here in cornwall and i am getting great care from here and a holiday    anyway the size 32 waist fit but the gut hung over they werent too tight but were on the tight side what is the general sizing like on asos im considering a haul    need tips on fashion sizing and asos
cool blog    j/k enjoy being sick and fat
  how low do you wear your jeans that you can fit 32 waist at 220lbs do they cover your dick
  its weird im the same skinny frame but now with bigger thighs and a big gut rest of me is same size i was at 145lbs with razor sharp abs
  if you cant enjoy the absurdness of life you are lost
what tops go with camo bottoms  i was thinking a black t shirt maybe with a design on it and a plaid shirt but idk  if im wrong feel free to correct me or whatever cuz im not great with fashion
  not buying actual dpm bdu pants for 20   anon what the fuck
keep the colors simple blues blacks greys one milspo or surplus piece per fit or you look like a larper
  this    and grey is a good shout op
keep your black tee plain or youll look like a hot topic shopper desu plaid wont look good with camo unless you power clash like a chad wear simple sneakers black boots maybe strappy tech sandals like tevas during summer if you miss 1998
  a first blood shirt you pussy
tfw manlet and therefore will never be effay   how do you cope with this feeling
  im 63 so i dont know 
  manlet here i dont cope i let the rage boil within me and hopefully one day ill fucking snap and beat some dumb slut to death in an elevator
  lil uzi is 5 foot 4 in and he has more swag than you
  fuck forgot image
  im not a famous rapper 179cm isnt awful but its not good eithet
  your folly is in thinking you need to be a famous rapper/famous person to be effay  expand your mind grasshopper
  54 is pretty short by most peoples standards especially /fa/s how short are you really
  im talking about myself i am 179cm which is 5 10 or 5 11 in murica i think
  you dont need to be famous to be effay unless youre a manlet then fame is mandatory or else your cope will show
  tfw super gay so it doesnt apply to me
  sorry man nobody deserves a death sentence like that
  im not desperatly resentful and depressed because im a manlet im 511 but i try to cope by telling myself i can go out of country and book a cheap hotel room to kill myself in easily at some point in the future and that ironically provides me comfort in my day to day life
  in what ways does cope show exactly    drink some fucking milk or something your okay
  same feels good
just be underweight and youll look well proportioned
im 56 and i dress hot and im sexy
  5 11  125 lbs  effay potential
  still getting more pussy then you    stay strong the manlet rebellion is coming soon    this is the only way
  im 58 breh im a manlet too  you cant beat me tho i browse /ck/ /fit/ and /fa/ im the final boss of attractive manletism
  learning how to cook  started working out finally  just need more money to purchase some good fitting clothes  things are looking up
  510 is considered a death sentence here   im 56   should i just voluntarily cut myself from the gene pool
focus on improving what you can and be positive being short sucks but it is what it is dont be overweight its neat that we can look ripped more easily im builtfat and 56 and i still have sex with attractive people and have good prospects most of the hate here is all in good fun
  hey mate its not about the clothes you wear learn what makes you feel attractive and other people will admire your free spirit many people wont but did you really expect everyone in the world to love you     make yourself in the best way possible and let life take care of the rest things are looking up breh cause your heads tilted up
  thank you man
  his height
  nigga just wear shoes with a one inch sole its not like youre 55
  hes joking 5 10 is good hes just so insecure about his average height that its funny
  lmao fucking manlet its literally over
  tfw browse all these boards and am tall
  should be ottermode around 145150 you know whats goal to build muscle and than starve yourself fuck what /fit/ says
  this but unironically
  thats average height you fucking asshole im 55 and never made a thread like this just wear slim jeans and tuck your shirt in fucker
  manlets have it easier when it comes to finding clothes in their size  lanklets will often find that their sizes are not in stock  average sizes get sold quick
  be lanklet  medium fits but sleeves too short  large sleeves fit but baggy otherwise  tall sizes have perfect arms but the torso is ridiculously long
  you gotta admit thats a pretty good pull for a dwarf like shes not ugly or morbidly obese kinda like a chick youd fuck from a bar that you might feel guilty about afterwards
  /fit/ /fa/ /asp/ /co/ and i have a 75 inch aesthetic dick    fuck you
  why dont you /diy/  im manlet and love longish baggy arms on shirts so i cut off and sew it up   t too poor for lemaire or yosjiiuh yamameantu
  imagine developing insecurites about you being a manlet because of troll infographics shared by incels when in reality youre above average height    consider necking urself op
  1 tailor your fucking shirt  2 tuck in your fucking shirt  idiot zoomers on this board know literally nothing   t 64
  who said i was being ironic i literally have these feelings
  you wish i put a limiter on my strength if you want the real list  /fit/ /lit/ /sci/ /fa/ /ck/ /diy/ /po/ s4s  i speak three languages that u taught myself study math and physics in my free time have written a few short stories which have received mixed to positive reviews online and with my peers and am working on a novel in my free time i discipline my body and mind and wake up at exactly 6 every day no matter what my plans and devote time to simply thinking about myself or anything else ive learned how to crack eggs one handed two at a time and can flip them using the pan handle maybe 30 of the time now i am an avid baker which is really my specialty  im also incredibly funny to be around and am known among my friends for improvising situational jokes and giving shit to everyone and taking shit from anyone but not really taking it because i take shit from no one on top of all of this i am a trained athlete with almost no bodyfat and a 75x55 dick and every girl ive been with has said i was the best theyve had probably because of my stamina and endurance and i also put thought into what they enjoy and what works for them    at the same time i am a manlet and wake up every day one inch closer to being so small i fall into myself and die    i know theres no validity on the internet so take this confession with a grain of salt i can tell you it is all true and especially the being short part because no matter how i improve myself it haunts me nags at me reminding me that no matter how much i build myself there are some big things that have been decided the day i was born and i have absolutely no control over
  do what the japanese do they embrace their shortness with relaxed fitting clothing
  you sound like a cool guy good luck man
  based positiveposter    your cope is made obvious by the sheer length of your post anon  you are free to feel that way however i want you to realize and truly accept that there is no point in building yourself up as a way of making up for any number of traits you have no control over  accept it anon  only after you are at peace with your shortcomings heh will the qualities you have truly shine    t lanklet with fucked up ribcage and spine
  thank you i find its not about confidence and attractiveness as much as it is a sense of peace and comfort in your own body no matter what youre stuck with yourself your entire life it benefits you and everyone else in the world if you make that guy someone worthwhile to be around
  thank you anon believe me though im not coping i genuinely enjoy everything i do its hardwired into me to be frustrated with everything out of my control and its also hardwired into me to be frustrated with anything less than excellence if i had a dollar for every time i complained because i felt my dick was to small as in not the biggest known dick in the universe or my athletic ability wasnt enough id have maybe like 25 which isnt chump change im comfortable with myself i just hate the fact that i cant be perfect and i know i shouldnt be i spend ages on 4chan cheering bros up and telling them perfection is boring and unnatural that doesnt make me want it any less
  you gotta be kiddin   im 64 and absolutely hate it
  1 tailor your fucking shirt  you can only do that within limits  2 tuck in your fucking shirt  i do but its still a lot of fabric in your pants
  i felt this on a spiritual level
if we all threw our problems in a pile and saw everyone elses we would most likely grab ours back    almost all people have something shitty going for them it may be your height you might have shitty skin balding or be indian just live your life
  feels good
im 52 bald and have eye bags like its whatever i had a girlfriend a few years ago she even paid for my bus ticket to her city
  5ft 8in
  based comfy confidence
  just accept your height and wear decent clothes and lift
how do i avoid looking like a soicuck
get your pants tailored to proper length  tuck your shirt in  buy nondumbshit boots  get rid of that stupid fucking beanie
  dont dress like one  dont act like one  dont eat like one
dont be a manlet
dont do workwear when not at work
  it literally doesnt matter people are going to call you a śoyboy no matter what the fact that youre worried about it makes you seem pretty insecure
  no    ever heard anyone call david gandy a basedboy basedboy
  t śoyboy
shave and get contact lenses the facial hair  black framed glasses is ruined for everyone forever especially for white people because of numales
  avoid mistakes like this guy made    no muscle  ugly brown boots  moc toe on his boots making things even worse  bright blue jeans despite pale skin  bright brown field jacket despite pale skin  black frames on pale skin stop fucking doing this its the ultimate soi sign  gay beanie hiding a shit hairline hes too scared to buzzpill  bad posture    people look soi for a reason you correctly identified this guy as soi you just need to learn why
moc toe boots are comfy and great i dont give a fuck if melvin thinks they look cool
  they also look retarded    jnco jeans are also comfy you look retarded if you wear them
  what does him being pale have to do with it
  you have to wear the right colors for your skin tone dont wear black frames with white skin it looks awful and is the soi calling card
  then what color frames should i wear  pic related is my pair
  they literally dont but in the end they were not designed as a fashion boot so if thats how you intend to wear them you will look retarded red wing shouldnt have included them in their highend line
no one is going to think you look like a basedboy outside of the lonely manchildren and teenagers that make up this board you shouldnt worry about it unless youre only into fashion to seek validation from anonymous people on the internet dress however you want no one actually gives a shit in real life  thanks to /fa/ whenever i see someone dressed like ops pic in public i cant help but think to myself wow look at that basedboy and i fucking hate it i wish i still shopped at zumiez and wore sketchers and had never visited this god forsaken website
  most people would think he looks bad its not a good outfit you should leave since you have mental illness
  too late youre here forever
  lift weights and dont grow a beard
  for sunglasses on whiteoids gold frames are usually a safe bet there are other options you want to avoid the hard contrast black frames have with your skin
  been here since the bush administration you have no fortitude  ignoring memes is the easiest shit if thats not what youre here for
unclench your fists bring your heels closer together and your toes further apart accentuate the pelvic region when talking to anyone male or female try to stand contrapposto so the person you are talking to thinks you are one second away from bending them over a table and fucking them also take off that beanie if you are cold use a scarf
  apex kek
  dress however you want no one actually gives a shit in real life  oh if only that was true that being said its usually the soiboilooking ones who are doing the mocking so fuck em
  bru theyre not for sunglasses for  its for my vision impaired ass
  for sunglasses on whiteoids gold frames are usually a safe bet  you managed to pick literally the one colour that makes pale skin look washed out   i congratulate you on your utter mediocrity     real answer for pale  sunglasses  tortoise silver or navy
  those are all fine but there is literally nothing wrong with gold frames on white people classic teardrop sunglasses on white actors were gold frames green lenses
  navy frames look almost as bad as black on a pale face too much contrast gold is a great choice that you dismiss as mediocrity as you huff your own farts
  spoken like a true soyboy
  stop being a low t whte
  avoid workwear  dont roll your jeans  dont get anything in slim/skinny fit  dont grow a beard  dont wear thickrimmed glasses    there thats all you have to do
  what about white or silver
  the thing about soyboys is theyd look soy in straight jeans too  to stop looking like one they need to change their entire character
  they wouldnt look as bad if it werent for the onions uniform youre right that they might still look bad regardless but at least they wouldnt look like they were pretending to be masculine by adopting traditional workwear and failing
  this guy is right                  why would you not want to look like this my wifes boyfriend tells me i look fabulous
  white is kind of feminine but silver is an excellent choice
  cool im gonna go with silver for my next paid thanks
  you are melvin if you think that looks good
  patagucci on my necc
  in the case of ops image work out more stop slouching i cant tell but it looks like his mouth is hanging open too the first thing i noticed about his fit was his watch cap dont wear them like that it looks childish and makes his receding hairline even more noticeable 2nd is his glasses worst choice he could have made go with something more conservative and thinner think of your grandfathers glasses gold or silver thin arms circular or rectangular lenses next his face shave or grow a real beard but otherwise shave jacket and shirt sleeves are a little short but not horrible i actually dont mind the cuffed look but i think it looks a little silly when its done by people like this those boots arent even that bad i bet but they look horrible on him      honestly if he just stood up straight was clean shaven ditched those glasses and hat hed look fine but he just looks insufferable
  this    i think the problem with workwear isnt workwear itself its just come to be associated with effeminate men when worn by someone who appears confident and strong many find the style attractive
  dont wear overpriced workwear when in reality youre an office drone
  try to be black soicuck is a white boi thing
  too late
  why are you on the fashion board
  haha yes true true  however
    get a swatiska tattooed on the face
  dont wear your hat so far back you onions lover
  fuck     no one is immune
    lift a weight  eat a meat
  dont be white  dont be balding  dont be a manlet  dont be skinnyfat
  eat a meat    well there is actually more bad hormones in meat than in onions
  im a tall skinny jew with a full head of hair    still get called soiboi
  this makes me very sad
  no soi has a tremendous amount of phytoestrogens that arent in meat red meat has tons of creatine and all sorts of things to mak you big and strong
  please tell me this isnt real
do  shave or trim beard  wear contacts  wear fitting clothes  have an obvious athletic physique  eat healthy  basic hygiene  trim body hair  exercise  get your hormone levels tested    dont  wear söy glasses  grow a beard if its not dense enough  wear raw denim  wear skinny jeans  wear anything in ops pic  drink alcohol  be fat / skinnyfat  act like a söyboy  be vegan    protips  have good body proportions  be attractive  be muscular  be tall
  dont  browse 4chan
  someone please post the shop where theyre not fat and it looks okay
  look confident  of course there are people who make the ςοy look passable but thats mainly because theyre on the round side and theyve choosen to look like dorks instead of insufferable neckbeards
  the estrogen in meat comes from the šoy that is fed to the animals if you live in burgerland its a good idea to avoid meat especially red meat but who the fuck knows hormones and onions are probably in every food now so it doesnt even matter anymore
  best advice
letting 4chan of all places dictate how you dress  letting memes affect your real life  not dressing how you want because some 17 year old incel neet called you a meme on the internet     yall a bunch of faggy sheep i tell you what
  have high testosterone
  be cool
there are people in this thread right now offering advice without posting fits
  trim body hair  what are you a faggot  wear raw denim  nothing wrong with raw denim  drink alcohol  underaged confirmed  wear söy glasses  nothing wrong with glasses    this just proves you lack taste and youre basically a basedboy for that
  trim body hair  what are you a faggot  nope i know what looks good and not taking care of your physical appearance because youre scared is retarded  keeping a dead cat on your chest isnt masculine it looks disgusting there are people who absolutely need to trim their chest hair shorter dont be scared like this  faggot  nothing wrong with raw denim  yeah youre right about that  drink alcohol  dont drink lots of alcohol alcohol increases estrogen and you may get a beer belly  nothing wrong with glasses  i said šoy glasses those glasses make every person uglier
drop the beanie and get clothes you dont drown in
  also dont wear workwear if you dont work with your damn hands
  what frames is he supposed to wear
    gold silver tortoise and clear are all fine navy is not fine
  if youre white there isnt a pair of glasses on the planet that wont make you look like a faggot  its just the truth at this point    op needs to get contacts get buff get tan and then shave his head  in that order
  just so everyone knows that was once a girl
    dont eat shitty factory meat then you dumb cunt its not my responsibility to make you an informed shopper
  fuck off /fit/ incel     you can literally tell which one of you cucks is from that shithole based on a single post
  i look more sophisticated with glasses at the expense of looking older
the only critical errors are the beanie and the bad posture
  ts0yb0i
  thin metal frames
  posture
  wrong thin silver gold tortoise frames are all great
  these
  yeah as long as you get the right shape for your face    look at patrick batemans glasses and white pale girls with tortoise glasses are so fucking hot
  kind of but those are a bit thick / dark
  patrick batemans glasses  those are thicker though
  look at patrick batemans glasses
  all thesr dense motherfuckers in the comments  apart from slight issues with posture and total lack of muscle mass i would say he looks absolutely fine
fuck are beanies onions i can actually pull one off pretty well but fuck looking like one of these things
  beanies are söyböy par excellence to hide their bad fucking hairline
  actually premature male balding happens due to high testosterone
  comments  he looks absolutely fine  onions redditor spotted
  testosterone gets converted into estrogen if you have too much of it
  overly high testosterone you want high test but it gets to a point where it impacts you negatively
  comments  ok replies then let me ask you something if we remove the beanie and add him some muscle a lot maybe he would look really good   then he would look like an fma sheep  well in my opinion if a buff dude had that style he would look at least decent
average weight of posters itt 230
    which colour do i get  i have these in black right now and i have pale skin and didnt think it looked that bad now this thread is making me change my mind wtf
  130
  those look nice
bought a pair of these a couple years ago while working in my dads metal shop because they were the only decent looking work boots a lot of electricians on job sites wore them for some reason if you dont actually do manual labor and arent going to wear out the boots youre a faggot and the definition of basedboy
  pic related looks absolutely fine idk what youre on about

  i cant wait until the eventual autistic post asking /fa/ to help them with this fit
nice chastity hoodie
varusteleka should make something like this from finnish military wool
  its fucking retarded even as a gag costume
  effay as fuck only laggards and redditors will disagree
got an extremely good deal on these but dont know if they are real does anyone here have an idea
  extremely good deal  how much
check the inside tags with the size and the production information on them the tags are usually faulty on counterfeits is there a small 1 pixel dot somewhere around the qr code does the  code match the label on the box     the box should have an adidas logo also on the bottom size label should be on opposite of the end that opens that seems good on your pair it should say 500 on top of the box
  why didnt you just get salt cw i got my on friday without any hassle they were really easy to get on release day
  i didnt even get them yet these are the pics the guy sent me and im still contemplating
  theyre fake
  how do you come to that conclusion
so i got my grandfathers 14 karat gold glasses from 1920 got a new pair of lenses put in and had them polished  are antique glasses /fa/
  looks pretty fucking tight anon im kinda jelly hows the comfort
  very effay
  11/10 very jelly want glasses so bad
  im jealous ive been looking for glasses like these everywhere closest i found did have that bridge but they were oval and 250 fuck that
  i always wondered arent those hings behind your ears annoying  i know you can get flexible ones but those look solid maybe because i have kinda attached lobes detached will probably be fine
  i like the watch  the glasses will are super small  i like them but i feel that nowadays is kinda impossible pulling them off without looking like a try hard
damn those are nice
  looks nice but that kind of hook style earpiece is fucking miserable i have a pair but couldnt stand wearing them
  as someone who has several pairs of similar glasses i say yes
  beautiful
  springy hook style earpieces  no nose pads  youre going to have a bad time op those glasses are going to dig into the bridge of your nose and hurt like a motherfucker if you try to wear them for a prolonged period of time    still theyre /fa/ as fuck
  surprisingly well i was worried they would be uncomfortable but theyre really comfortable to wear     i thought so too but you can kinda bend them to fit your ear     ive been wearing them for 2 days now and so far theyre actually pretty comfortable  heres a cringe pic of me wearing them
    never forget that these are the people giving you advice
  of course any advise is great
    holy shit i mean thanks for responding but why post this lad good god
    ahahahahahahahahahahahaha  the absolute state of /fa/  how can your forehead look more enormous oh i got it wear tiny fucking glasses ahaha
  you do not deserve those glasses you alton brown looking mf
uh oh
is this thread real lmfaooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
    thank you for pointing out my balding 
  yeah lmao who the fuck wears items passed down to them through generations haha who the hell would want to show respect for their ancestors by taking care of their intimate things like glasses and be proud of them lmao am i right guys haha
  theyre pointing it out because youre wearing tiny ass glasses which only makes your forehead look even bigger    your skin is also unclean as fuck and youre obviously out of shape    everything about your outfit is hilarious youre trying so hard at being le supreme gentleman
  its okay bro do you no need to be mad iz only gaem
    post photo of your retarded soeboy balding acne zit ridden looking ass  holding a fucking nufilthy frank book  what the fuck guise why be mean  muh ancesturz  yeah fuck you bitchboi go kill yourself i bet your mom took those pics
    holy shit
okay now this is epic
    nevermind the haters you look like a dork but in a good way the glasses are great and you would look very good if not for goofy balding shave it off your head doesnt seemm that bad desu
  well i have shaved it once like completely bald i just dont know if im ready for that
    stop talking with yourself op
    clothing wise pretty /fa/ but you should go buzzbeard immediately anon
    im not op i actually made a handy piffy graphic for you guys too see what potential he has
  lmao u actually have pretty good paint skills
  op here whats this suppose to be super saiyan
  my interpretaion of the chad haircut
    your head is way too big to wear glasses of that shape op
  i thought its a oblivion reference
  the adoring fan is pretty chad
  hes a little beta bitch like u
  consider getting a weave or a wig seriously your hairline for anyone is atrocious let alone someone in there teen or twentys the glasses are cool are they plate or full 18k gold also what is the story about the watch
dont listen to them op you look perfectly fine and it is your birthright to wear these glasses just maybe get better reading material
  solid 14k gold worn by my grandfather his whole life since 1920 polished them myself and got my local optician to make some lenses to my measures
  weird i have the opposite problem glasses with nosepads are uncomfortable but i can wear my pair without all day and feel fine
  bond villian core very nice you pull it off
  
    dope as fuck anon
  i say yes i love this style of glasses and i dont know about anyone who still makes them anymore
    pictures of you reading in a field are a little odd but i like what you have going
  yes oh great and mighty grand champion is there something you need can i carry your weapon shine your boots backrub perhaps
  consider wearing hats the forehead is the only think really wrong here
that hairline  that complexion    something doesnt add up
  you look like youre so proud of that poverty omega
        wonderful frames op love the style and youre lucky that they fit you well off the bat   sure as hell beats that generic rectangular plastic frame thats fucking everywhere these days what are they called numale glasses those things    how do you feel about the gold colouring though i have a similar modern and not solid gold in a silver and have been eyeing the gold but and thinking they might be just a bit too noticeable they pop seemingly just a little too much for my own liking  have you always worn goldmetal frames
  i love curved cable temples unfortunately unless youre lucky like op and can score a vintage pair theres only a handful of frames makers that offer them and none are widely available mainstream brands shuron us savile row/algha uk and a few jap makers that produce in batches and are never seemingly in stock ffs  basically old factories thatve been making glasses frames for over a century still produce this shit well a japmade pair modern i had had kinda weak curves that didnt like to be bent too much before something snapped off that was just one make mind you and i know that theyre a couple of them out there so ymmv    when bought they did hurt the where they rested on the tops of my ears and i needed a lot of adjusting before they were comfortable shits bendy metal so theres a lot of leeway for adjustment after a few hours of wear i thought id made major mistake as it really hurt had to go back to the opticians to get the guy that helped make the fucking frames suit my face better ive adjusted subsequent pairs myself  for years and years i wanted curved cable riding temples because shit would always always slide down my nose in this heat i live in no frames fixed this and all would eventually loosen in the end anyway and start sliding off my nose  eventually just started putting rubber bands around the legs so that the added friction would help keep the fuckers on my face they sell rubber extensions you can add to your uncurved temples now fuck i wish they had been readily available about 17 fucking years ago wouldve saved me a hell of a lot of hassle and embarrassment as i have always refused contacts  now i can do sporty shit without the risk of anything flying off they were originally called riding temples after all you can order these silicon things cheap off ebay to give the them a go to see if theyd be useful for you not exactly the same feel as the full curved cable temple but its a start
   nose pads  youre going to have a bad time op those glasses are going to dig into the bridge of your nose and hurt like a motherfucker if you try to wear them for a prolonged period of time  i got a pair of cable temples with the saddle bridge and i honestly prefer that pair to the two others with the nosepads all have the riding temples  that bridge is far more comfortable than any nose pad ive had  its kinda disconcerting since in all the years ive had to wear spectacles ive always been aware of them being on my face so that at the end of the day i have never failed to take the fuckers off before i sleep  unfortunately  with this pair i habitually fall asleep with them on i really dont want to break them  i recall they did dig a little at first but after some adjustment theyre incredibly comfortable or maybe im just used to them now  i bought the saddle bridge option on a whim based on the salesmans insistence that many of his customers that opted for a saddle bridge never returned to the nose pads and found them more comfy overall im more inclined to put myself in that camp its nice that the frames are a contained metal unit without any shitty plastic nose pads to discolour and fall off eventually or by accident one of the other pairs has the standard clear pad and the jap pair has titanium which are obviously more long lasting    drawback for saddle bridges is that you really have to get the measurements done right i searched throughout my shitty city for an antique device that was used to measure ones nosebridge for precisely this purpose of course that was like trying to find a needle in a haystack since the native population of this country doesnt nose bridges if youre in europe or the us then theres probably an old optician that can do that measurement for you

  just do give in but only eat one meal a day
this came up on /sci/ it should be of interest for people here
  also just found out that it is from /fit/ 22 feb 2018
asked this last thread but what womens pants size is equivalent to waist 27/28 for mens thanks in advance
  no music  dropped    jokes aside im sure there is less tramatic ways of defucking your life if you have the willpower to do that shit for 7 days you have enough to do anything  its like the rich saying they make 200k a yr so how is anyone poor
  this
  i would say like a 4 ish i have a 25/26 waist and wear a size 3 so 45 would be a good starting point keep in mind womens sizes dont account for length and youll have to shop specifically for longer pants if youre above 58
  it is stated that 7 days is arbitrary anyway it applies to me feeling lazy spending the day on internet indulging in any little pleasure smoking and such it seems the situation described by few other anons in here having a short period of abstinence from dopamine traps might helps to get priorities straight so i wanted to post it here before leaving for a while since it might be of help stay well and hydrated
  hope it works  if you have the capacity to do it tho ur already in good standing
thin boys are so cute o
  being this drastic is actually overall less demanding willpower wise because you are already deprived of the source of your addiction/distraction
  makes sense iirc changing many habits at once is easier than a few at a time which also turns out to be more convenient im going to try the guide posted thanks to that anon
  10/10 post  i knew deep down selfdeprivation for all of my vices and bad habits was the way to go
m / 61 / 136lbs    how much do you people eat usually im trying to stay below 1200 calories when im not exercising but today i ate 1530 and did not even leave the house    ive been sick for almost a week cant exercise must eat the right amount of food to get healthy as fast as possible but not too much to stagnate/gain any tips its just frustrating
  im a 56 manlet desu
how do i lose weight from my face im basically all i want from the rest of my body i think my arms and posture need a bit work though but i have puffier cheeks than id like to have are there any methods or is it just genes at least i have a fairly prominent jawline though
  im unlucky enough to be tall kind of hard to shop for clothes but my legs are really long which is pretty good desu
imagine starving yourself as a male  pathetic
  this image is mostly just bs but should do more good than harm thinking 7 days of exercise is enough to form a habit of weight training is pretty optimistic
  starving is one of the manliest things you can do full control over your body and mind not needing anything from anybody you compete with yourself and others  being a fatty with no self control is pathetic cope more
going to start keto for december and need to make a shopping list of foods i need should i bother with metamucil for fiber any under the radar foods i should look into that are no or very low carb    so far im getting tuna eggs various meat cuts older cheeses olives pickles what nutrients/vitamins am i missing im gonna take vitamin c and d supplements daily
  i am an estrogenized male thank you very much
  def get fiber unless you want hemorioids and every time you get hemorioids you are much more likely to get another  try some red meat for iron if you keep eating canned tuna you will have some heavy metal poisoning if its fresh tuna thats great  salmon too  get a multivitimin unless you miss something
  at what bmi are you considered /thin/  177 cm 63 kg reporting in
  maybe if you have an actual physical lifestyle doing nothing all day while starving yourself is peak onions

  thank you
  youre welcome anon      depends a lot on your frame id say 1618 for sure       i eat 1000 calories and burn 200 walking or doing some other stuff   drink lots of water take some meds sleep if youre hungry and feeling like youre going to overeat      im sure ive seen this before and seen it called total bs although its quite interesting desu
  how much is too much tuna    23 cans a week too much i buy skipjack only
  most other drugs reduce appetite too besides weed
  how is tuna another fish  23 cans is ok    oo maybe try smoked salman    idk keto is expensive    try making roasts too  like chuck and carnitas and stuff cheap fat
  that nose ring looks drawn on  ssris and snris do not reduce appatite  they made me gain 40 lbs which have been hell to remove  i used to be thinspoish 6 135  went to 180 in 2 mo
got skinny just to realize im short as fuck with a big ass ribcage and a bobblehead  why am i so foolish
  i mean recreational drugs psychedelics opiates benzos stuff like that

  how tf is he so skinny with such a fat fucking face
  genetics
  ftm
  this is how people itt actually look
  what are some good books to read while i do this
eating too little puts your body into starvation mode consuming muscle instead of fat  is this real or mom science i feel like if this was true people fasting would turn into literal skeletons
  i thought he was failed mtf    freakonomics 12  i think nonfiction is best    mom science  your body is not going to not use all the energy food can provide you  there is no way to go into starvation mode and squeeze all the enegry out of food  starving can effect muscle tho but thats above my brain fold count
ive never been on a diet or done any serious exercise
2nd week of eating an average of 115k calories  have lost maybe a pound  what am i doing wrong im counting properly
going through this weight loss journey ive started to think about how this is going to be a strong condemnation to the media and society when i reach my ultimate weight goal ive heard tons of missing leading comments gym teachers telling me to eat immediately after every exercise adults in the gym advising how bodybuilders would eat 2 hours a day and even wake up in the middle of the night to eat women bragging to me about how bulky and protective their husband is    anorexia is not an illness its a lifestyle choice i saved amount 30 of my income my devotion to my family and spirituality has gone up significantly overall the positive effects far out weigh the negative were going to fucking make it
  fasting is actually better for muscles than eating little because it releases growth hormone that keeps them from depleting
  nice pot belly you skinnyfat freak
  seething  feels bad to not have god tier metabolism doesnt it
  im 60 160lbs and feel extremely skinny  you must be a fucking twig
  eat all meals in the span of five hours  light work out and running  drink water and cut all candy and sugary drins  meals are healthy  learn to cook for yourself  learn to make chicken and vegetables interesting
  i am 3 lbs heavyier then you and fat as fuck
    i cant imagine 61 163 being fat although i know a lot of people who are similar height 120     you must have 0 muscle mass to be fat at 163
  if you are 6 feet tall and think you are fat at 160 you have a mental disorder
  i will do this starting monday next week  i think this is exactly what i need thank you  over the past 4 months ive been trying to improve and its slow but i need something drastic like this thanks for motivating me to get better friend i already picked up a book to read i never read anything and i hope itll help a little bit
  i can see outlines of some of my ribs already at 160 if i was 30 pounds less id look like a holocaust survivor
  you said 6 not 61    i think i have no muscle    im not gonna bodypost but i def look fat  thunderthigs belly 2chin chicken wings
  youve lost weight havent you stop moaning if you want to lose faster eat less or start exercising
this is me at 6 160 lbs for reference
  other then slight love handle u look good  a lot more muscle then me tho i cant open some doors
    lol im 62 160 and still skinnyfat as fuck you guys are just fatties in denial
  yes asceticism is good for discipline its not exactly a new discovery
    ya im fat right
  saggy tits  lovehandles that jut out  yeah you are lmfao
20 hours into fast going for 48 at least ive gained like five pounds from thnksgiving indirectly i didnt eat much on thanksgiving but that piece of pie set me off on a sugar binge reached 131 lbs a few days ago when im usually 125
  glorious triple doubles
  triple double doubles even
  if you ever wonder why normies always talk about how travel is soooo amazing and great this is why
  good metabolism is codeword for im skinny fat post a topless pic its not hard to get skinny arms like that
   tits  funny   that jut out  aka small amount of muscle above your pelvic bone    prolly a bait but if not you have a mental disorder
  sure all is fine for me except i need to do something about my flared ribs   censored because i dont want anyone to recognize me
  same but being short and skinny is always better than being short and chubby
male  18  62/165 pounds    ride is my ideal body super lean and cut with not a ton of muscle my muscle mass as it is is low and my bf is around 15 should i focus more on bodyweight exercises and such over cardio
  i would do both at least some cardio
  hes my ultimate thinspo too t bh senpai     im getting quite close to his body but i just need to trim some muscle around my chest/shoulder area   id say bodyweight exercises or very light weight lifting with high reps 3x1520 to keep toned without gaining too much mass   definitely do not neglect cardio though     and of course eat at a deficit like 10001200 or less
  you cant eat at a deficit foreverwhen you reach your ideal weight you need to stabilize your diet
    same i feel like ill never be truly thinspo with short manlet legs and if i do ill just look like a fucking middle schooler
fast day  eat tamales and chocolate chip cookies after 8 hours  300 cals over  rest in peace my hopes and dreams    at least i have 500 extra for the week gonna try again tomarrow
  thanks i was thinking of hiit cardio with light weight high rep lifting three times a week at a 1000cal deficit
  no wooden horse for you you stupid idiot
im glad these threads are still around ive been trying to get back down to 120 lbs and i just keep failing
  lol weak faggot on 29 hours rn
starting another water fast tomorrow hopefully acid reflux doesnt kill me like it usually does
  dont forget the salts
when did this place become so rude put the comfy disclaimer in the next op
  why the fuck would you ever water fast that does literally nothing except is terrible or your body      stop doing stupid gimmicks and change your lifestyle
  imagine not water fasting why would i eat when i dont need to
  fasting for 12 to 16 hours is good for you tho
  pretty sure hes just a shitposter water fasting is fine you just need willpower and free time so you dont overexert your body
  ever since the insecure /fit/fags started to show up and troll occasionally to make themselves feel better because they think their workouts and getting bigger is going to make them more attractive despite the fact low bf and attractive facial features are the most important thing in attracting people    bbbut i lift for myself    my absolute sides
  these threads do seem more active than when i used to visit so obviously more people are coming from somewhere it just seems overall more hostile than i remember

  i never thought of that as fasting i eat 1 meal a day 90 of days and almost exclusively drink water for over a year and would never say im fasting    by water fast do you mean only drinking water or not drinking water my initial impression is only drinking water but saying water fast is retarder backwards way of saying that    i just misinterpreted water fast as not drinking or eating    if you guys refer to eating only 1 time a day as fasting it is very easy after 1 week of doing it your body adjusts pretty quick i would add protein shake so you lose less muscle mass if you are aiming to lose fat
  everyone on the internet just calls it a water fast you are only drinking water and nothing else refraining from water for some reason would actually be retarded
  just google water fast and youll see what it means i can understand how you could get confused though i wouldnt call only eating one meal a day fasting either
  lifting and thinspo is pretty gay normie girls only really care about face and social/economic standing being buff probly gets more then being rail thin but most people here dont want to be thin they want to be lean like the mcride thing   its more leanspo then thinspo    but if you fast for 30 days with no water under a tree you get a religion named after you
  it is real but only happens in extreme cases of starvation and usually leads to death or irreversible damage
red line represents my bmr according to      i actually cobbled together a python script to read my custom food diary file format fuck my life
  6 160 is not thin at all and no where near thinspo    sorry pal
  thats only if youre already at a very low bf     the human body isnt stupid the exact reason it stores fat is for use in times where it cant get calories it needs it isnt gonna go into starvation mode when it has like 30 pounds of fat stored for literally exactly that situation
im 6ft and like 135140 is that thinspo  i never really post on /fa/ but i know im skinny af but not skeleton levels so it is pretty nice  im probably low key anorexic im scared about getting chubby so i run a ton and dont really eat that much and force my self to eat healthy
  hey youre being productive and semi learning a decently paid skill winwin honestly
18 171 lbs  goals at 145150  lows at 160  this is my highest i wanna reverse it  most of the fat on my body is on my stomach and i usually suck it in but im done with that  lads im doing like 10 minutes of core about an hour on the bike doing intervals and eating at a 800 calorie deficit every day through the calculator its gonna take me around 3 months to get there what else can i do to do this more efficiently/improve my ability to get there  i dont care about eating or anything like that and im not obsessed with food but eating more than about a 1200 calorie deficit means i cant focus on shit other than my hunger
im a 51 guy and id look retarded if i tried to bulk up on muscle so im going for the skinny cuteboi look instead whats the ideal weight for someone my size im at 110 rn
  shit i almost forgot im 63
male 23 174cm weight might be anywhere from 6762kg  tdee should be approximately 1800 cal  highest weight 78kg lowest 55kg  ive let myself for the past year and gained a lot of weight back ive been scared to step on a scale for a while now so i dont know my exact weight  started watching my calories again almost three weeks ago pic related  left column is calorie intake second is total calories that day so minus tdee and the right one is total calories since the beginning  fucked up few times mostly the second weekend because i drank a lot
  let myself go
i can only see how fat i really am by looking at pictures of myself when i look in the mirror i can obviously tell i have a fat stomach but my face etc look exactly the same as before i got fat on the rare occasion i let someone take a picture of me i can see everything my face is fat my arms everything what mental illness is this called
  also how do i fix this i definitely feel its setting me back when it comes to trying to lose weight because ill look in the mirror and think alright thats good enough but its not reality smh
  watch your weight not how you look  set a weight goal and weigh yourself every day after waking up and pissing
  fat
  who
r8 my breakfast chai tea with two packs of honey and raw walnuts not gonna eat the whole bag    im somewhere between 61 and 511 i weigh maybe 135 and my goal is 110 im biologically male but a tranny
  boipussy or gtfo
down 12lbs this first month boys sipping my morning breakfast of miso broth as we speak lunch will be a slice of whole grain seed bread with peanut butter dinner will be a half cup of steamed veggies doused in olive oil going to hit the gym later it was only super difficult the first week i think a lot of the weight loss is because i stopped drinking daily it will probably slow down in subsequent months
    those are pecans
  51  yikes sorry man
  disagree id only weigh yourself 1 time a week same day in the morning weighing yourself every day will be discouraging as you wont see progress
  dunno i lost 20kg by weighing myself every day and writing in excel table
    ndri is where its at bby contraindicated for anorexia but i guess my doc felt there was no other way after trying ssri/snri which only left me with stomach pain and 30lbs of added fat respectively
standing up my legs look fine but sitting down my thighs look fucking massive  pic related
nothing but water  already 75 hours in  wow lmao how the time flies how are you maintaining yourself thin faggots
  massive
what do you buy for a water fast i know you need potassium and sodium but how much do you buy the oral rehydration powders does drinking soup broth count
  i mean ya it doesnt actually effect how much weight you are losing i just dont think it is a good thing to obsess over
  nothing lol just put down the food and drink water instead  snake juice might be helpful and all but im doing 4 out of 7 days a week fast and i never bothered with sodium and potassium and any of those meme powders  i do drink a lot of water and as much mineral water as i can afford easily 3 liters a day
  same problem i wondered if is that way because im into long distance running but i dont even have that massive leg muscles its mostly fat im afraid and i dont like fat
  7 days def isnt enough to solidify a consistent workout regime but like other posters have already stated this should do more good than harm and could lead to a great life program down the road i think im going to try this
  based and buddhapilled
where do i place on the auschwitz to ottermode scale 6 130140lbs
  its because regardless of how thin your leg genetics are from the front you still have thigh fat just lose some more
  meh standard
  you seem really insecure yea the fat at the sides are fat not muscle your the one who looks like they have a mental disorder since apparently your the only one here not realizing it
  the guy at auschwitz that threw all the ash in the ditch for extra food
is he thinspo
  no man tiddies tummy over shorts
  your legs still thicc af bro
  stats please
  17 bmi atleast
54 113 female thats a rib not a breast at the top im so sick of being chubby and wish i was just skinny so someone would like me how much more should i lose
  people do like you just not the 62 rich tall dude with a full head of hair
  your not showing much but as a thinspo guy ya look qt dont change
  no i just dont think being 130lbs with 0 muscle is a good look nor is it healthy
  no i dont even want chads since id never feeling secure going for a guy with too many girls after him the only tall guy ive liked was absurdly tall and also fat so no girls seemed to really want him besides that the guys ive like have usually been my height or shorter i have no physical standards      thanks anon
  judging by your rib sticking out you should already be pretty thin if you want to lose more fat you should build some lean muscle first or at the same time
  absolute state of this gymcoper
  first of all we cant see your body properly and youre probably sucking in so whatever
  how am i looking twinks
  never went to the gym 1 time in my life
  no to be honest you look like shit lmao lose some weight before posting here again
    yeah up to 17 bmi now feelsbad  511 1204lbs
bruh yea no im 16 bmi at 6ft1 fuck off fatty
  didnt mean to quote but you fat
  alright lets see what you look like  if i want to lose more weight id maybe go to 155150 but not sure if that is even a good idea
  this is what a real man looks like unironically
  was doing good in the start of the week now im flopping hard did horrendously bad on wednesday and so bad yesterday and only okay today      purging is pointless right you still gain the weight bc of the intestines absorbing the calories or whatever i thought i saw someone say thatcan anyone confirm this    also if its pointless why do people even bother doing it i think thats why im confused since its obviously a method people use to get thinner or do they just like the feeling of not having food in their belly
  ive lost 30lbs 180 to 140 through fasting and restricting then 140 to 110 through purging through purging theyre lying
  purging is terrible for your body dont do that  dont look for easy/gimmick to lose weight  just drink water and 500700 cal/day deficit
  dont post pictures if you cant handle the truth fatty
  do you purge right after a meal how long is too long after a meal to purge     thanks ill try lol ive only done it about 3 times and felt incredibly guilty and pathetic afterwards
  you dont gain weight overnight you cant lose it overnight
does chew and spit work for late night cravings
  just go to sleep dude
  honestly this
    i cant go to sleep at 9pm  but late night cravings  im fucking starving from 6pm to when i go to sleep every fucking day even if i eat a large balanced meal
any diet advice for looking like this  
  sorry to hear that just deal with it i find that for me things are easier when i set clear and rigid goals for myself ie fasting from say 6pm until whenever i go to sleep it seems like that could benefit you as well overall the best and only solution to not eating at night is not eating at night not really any tricks to get around that sorry /
  if you want to do intermittent fasting your body will get used to it after like a week and it isnt too hard after that  to get by the hard period my best advice would be to keep yourself occupied and engaged in something
not sure if i would actually go back to wearing it but i want to fit into brand melville xs pants again thats the goal most of their models are such good thinspo
naturally thin 18 bmi and very low body fat percentage  i eat like shit with my diet comprising of a whole lot of carbs and dont really go out of my way to get regular cardio    to what age can i expect to neglect my health until i have to actually start putting in work  pic unrelated
  if u are hungry u should be eating i naturally spit out food if its too much thats how i know i am full because it just feels like eating for the sake of eating i wont swallow it i spit it out because its over indulging  i havent eaten much of anything all week and i made 4 poached eggs pic related
  the black stuff is pepper and those are swedish flatbreads this is a good meal
i have a 225 bmi 511 and 161 lbs and i want to get down to like 20 whats the best way to do that
  the best way is literally fasting and of course with taking electrolytes daily and maybe vitamins if youre willing to go more than 2 weeks  some here will say caloric restriction but if you restrict too low youre likely to binge eat or fuck your metabolism and youll be constantly craving sugar but its up to you to decide senpai
  ive been doing intermittent fasting for a few weeks and dropped 5 pounds but youre saying it could fuck up my metabolism and stagnate if i eat too little
  probably thats why a lot of people who eat like 200 calories a day get stuck on a plateau and dont know what to do i recommend you to get into omad if youre not willing to do prolonged fasting it is really effective
  looks pretty tasty anon
how much weight have you guys lost since the last time you weighed yourself and how often do you weigh yourself  lost 4 lbs weigh myself every day
  this happens to anyone regardless how skinny you arei wouldnt worry about it
  i lost 5 pounds of water weight in 3 days     not sure when the fat loss will begin

  does anyone have any experience with aes chinos ive lost like 20 pounds since new years and im at the horrible borderline between mens and boys size now around 28 waist and ae is one of the few mallbrands that actually has size 26 which is really 28 ive tried abercrombie for something a bit nicer and even their size 26 chinos are wider than 28 some stuff on the way from hollister hope those works out dunno what other mallbrands i can try at this point besides the boys section which have fits that are too baggy
  was also going to add that pic related looked disgustingly wrinkly but its cheap off clearance right now so ehh
  went to sleep for lunch today
  seek help
  someone please talk me out of eating i really want to buy a pizza

58 and have been 180 pounds for a month after losing 5 pounds water weight when will it start going down
bout god damn time these threads came back
  restrict more just make food your enemy
  ssris dont reduce appetite    uwot m8
  alot
  they never left
ive had a five day binge a serious one like twice my tdeemaybemore   ill be back up tomorrow i know know know that i dont want the life that comes with eating like this
  depriving yourself of your vices is a good way to stop relying on them  wow no shit sherlock
  if youre not losing anything after a month then youre not restricting enough if it persists despite that you should probably consult a doctor for advice
  stop eating fatty fat fat
  had a late night snack of steamed brocoli and i can not stop farting
skinny  flat 
  likely to fuck your metabolism    this is incorrect mom science with no scientific basis    if you eat less than you burn you lose weight any metabolism fuckery is only applicable when literally starving aka your body is starting to eat your organs
  do you swim
checking and see how long it would take me to reach a normal bmi  tfw it takes about 7 months straight fasting to reach normal bmi  tfw ill reach normal bmi in 2 years if i do a 1500 calorie deficit  tfw never gping to make it      how in the fuck will i accomplish this i am referencing to the fasting help me out
    its a marathon not a sprint any progress is good progess
  you are 288 lbs overweight or do you mean 500 cal deficit im confused
  what is a good weight 163cm im 44kg my body is about like this i worry that the sticc look is just weird on big hips
  288 lbs  god damn man i am not a fucking tub of lard im 160 overweight not good but it aint 288 and i mean a 1500 cal deficit    thank you for the vote of confidence but it is a long path that i must take
    noncomprehensive list   prepare every meal you eat yourself   lentils plus steamed veggies are your new staple food   dont eat shitty processed food no soda nothing with added sugar stuff like raw tofu or unsweetened onions sauce is okay though    go ovovegetarian ie eat plants and eggs   get a kitchen scale and count calories yes vegetables count  exercise to improve mental health and willpower      if you want to fast do a omad eat a smaller or equal bmr amount of calories every day at say 2pm within a one hour timeframe the next day again and so forth which means youll have 24 hours between meals otherwise make sure that you dont snack at all even if its something healthy fasting only works if youre not eating anything at all between meals which means you have to stay hydrated also add enough sodium to your meals incorporate 1 litres of veggie broth into you meals for example filling and high in sodium
  they dont i gained 10 pounds in the month i was on escitalopram fuck that shit
at swimming pool  every time i do a lap i count the number of calories i think i burnt on that lap  get to the end of my swim  panting and start repeating 763 to myself as i think i burnt that  some fat guy in the next lane who is stretching overhears me  763 lad thats a bit specific  try to be funny and joke with him  haha i was counting your heartbeats per minute when someone offers you a salad instead of burgers  he gets mad at me for joking with him and says lad im like the fockin moasaurops in jurassic park i will fockin drown you  tries to grab me  have to run away    why are fatties so fucking bitter
  yeah okay but still why eat like 200 calories or less a day just fast theres no reason to spike your insulin and stop your fat burning for such a small amount of food with 200 calories you cant even replenish all your electrolytes
  you made that up
  ok i did i admit it im sorry ive been struggling with eating recently and i wanted to make a funny story i apologise for that
  based usage of exclamation point     based cordial admitting of guilt
  you could cut that time in half if you add intense exercise
  1500 calorie deficit means cutting 1500 cal from your daily intake do you mean youd eat 1500 less calories daily or that youd eat 1500 calories daily he calculated the weight youd be to have to wait 2 years at a 1500 deficit to get to normal weight because he was unsure what you meant due to your newfaggotry
im 169cm and recently hit finally 59 9 kg to go 3
ate a lot yesterday  had abdominal pain at night  lost weight  hmmm questioning if i have any problems with wheat and/or dairy
  to think of it it was like an hour after eating the yoghurt my tummy started hurting just had some more yoghurt to test
  what are some good low cal soups whats your favorite soups
  not really a soup but fry no oil some onions mushrooms and hot peppers and you get a savory dish only about 100 cal

  read the post you daft cunt i specifically said 1500 cal deficit so i am going to eat 1500 less than my daily in take i fucking read op and the sticky over at /fit/ i am sure that what i said is correct    thank you anon for this post ill look have to look into it more though becauee there nothing about protein unless i have to live the veggie life    true will see what /fit/ has to offer probably would be just ss or ppl tho
  id really suggest cutting dairy products and wait for changes to your skin i accidentally did not eat any dairy products for a few days and my skin got better so i just cut everything milk out of my diet to see what happens not only have i lost a bit of weight but the worst of my acne is gone after  a month confounding factor might be that i dont eat any added sugars milk contains a noninsignificant amount of sugar which means it could just be because i consume less sugar in general now     but this episode has shown me that watching the shit i eat is incredibly important so its pretty good to try things out its free
  i think your goal is very attainable in 2 months so dont feel discourage it doesnt sound unrealistic to me at all if you really stay on track but everyone has their bad days you just have to be ready to make up for them when they occur extra exercise or fasting     something that worked for me was finding safe foods low cal things i enjoyed staying hydrated is the second i try to drink 64oz min and 1 gallon on a good day i tried exercising over the summer and saw results but eventually it became futile bc i always ate it back i grew up thin and being able to eat what i want bc i didnt eat all that much and was very active then when i got to college similarly to you my mental health went to shit i didnt get out much and i ate more so now im stagnant around 55 125127lbs trying to reach the same gw as you what has been stopping me is pure laziness lack of motivation and lying to myself underestimating what ive ate you could try logging you calories i always do it for about 2 weeks and stop but maybe that could work for you     i used the app myplate but myfitnesspal is popular too its all about having that mindset to want to look good if that is more important to you than the instant gratification as serotonin is released to your brain when you eat then you should have no problem staying on track im weak so im stuck dont be like me    im also obsessed with my legs what help me stay motivated is thinking about how good they will look in my old pants again i cant fit most of my old pants these days and it makes me sad but also motivated i cant act like its all for me or whatever i like to think about people noticing how much weight i lost and saying something about it happened to me over the summer and felt really good to hear
  doesnt myfitnesspal shut you down if you eat less than 1200 calories
  it doesnt stop you from logging but it doesnt let you see your diary summary of the day it will tell you to eat more lol it would be dumb to shut down an acc eating under 1200 since so many people forget to log everything all the time they would have to delete accs left and right
  lol fuck crickets mealworms are where its at you think im going to tend to a colony of gross bugs to feed my fatass leo when i could just put a little tub in my fridge and call it a day
  what youre trying to do sounds pretty irrational and not realistic unrealistic in the sense that what youre trying to do can be done but the amount of self disciple you need is crazy high     adjust your goal to be realistically attainable you plan to stick to your diet only during the two months afterwards you will think you can reward yourself and regain mass   set your goals differently and change your lifestyle one step at a time to accomplish the weight loss and most importantly keep the weight off long term
  squashcurry white bean and kale ramen but with miracle noodles kimchi  tofu chicken soup
  hey mate your goal seems pretty reasonable its just going to take a lot of discipline honestly just stick with it and when you fuck up remember that its not the end of the world when i fuck up ill just not eat anything the next day to both punish myself and also to make up for said fuck up overall try try not to fuck up but if you do theres always tomorrow good luck youve got this
  progresso has a bunch of super low cal ones and you dont have to add water watch out cause a serving is a half can
  especially these days when non dairy options are everywhere do you eat cheese  t white ppl like cheese   its tru
  holy shit thats awful   holy shit  lose it a based  you can even make your daily goal like 400 if u want
want to tap  know ill get hungry after  aaaaaaaaaa    why would i want to eat s0i cheese when i can eat actual cheese
  fap jej
  i asked if u eat real cheese lol  i guess you do   5oy cheese is gross  doesnt it count as dairy tho   also fap right before bed then go to slep
  yeah it is dairy but im gonna cut dairy as much as i can
  idk it doesnt make me hungry at all actually it makes me want to go to bed
  benzos can either make you incredibly hungry or help you ignore the feeling of hunger but youll probably eat on them bc you dont give a shit about anything

  bought some 40 cal bread today taste like ass not sure what i expected
  i got a lifetime of loose it account  i like that alot more then getting jewed for subscription  its cheaper then like 2 years of membership anyway    i hope to one day stop tracking its annoying and imo a crutch
want to go to the gym and just ride the bike for hours reading/watching netflix on phone/listening to music in relative peace    constantly think about how gross my scarred body is and will always be and the effort im putting in wont pay off in any way because even if i reach goal weight i still wont be happy or satisfied
  why the fuck you need an app to track calories it isnt hard to get an idea of what you are eating if you look shit up and know measurements remotely
511  121lbs  how much should i lose id like to reach male model physique  sorry for kind of dirty mirror

  weed reduces my appetite if i eat anything after smoking i get really bad cramps but it might be damage to my stomach or an eating disorder or anxiety or something i get dumb thirsty though
  tfw same height and 165 pounds  realize i have another 30 pounds to probably lose  welp gonna kms
how do i become super mega lean i hate being skinny fat
  lose fat gain muscle not rocket science
anyone here on a psuedofed cycle please help
  true but thats effort when youre an unmotivated fat fuck /
  routine is everything the first 12 weeks are the hardest  but your body will adapt and it becomes second nature  you will also feel better mentally  but ya nothing can replace motivation if you are motivated or can find motivation it is easy
  yeah just gotta push through usually eat less like shit when im gyming vs not i always lose motivation because im so weak but thats no excuse
      different anon here im a total pleb when it comes to books where can i download all this stuff is there like a soulseek for books im a poorfag so i cant afford all this shit currently started reading wuthering heights but i guess ill finish it in less than a week
  dont get down man im a different anon but i was in your position and im almost there now just remember the goal currently 136 on the way to skinny from skinnyfat
  same here all i can manage is a two day fast before i fail    i went from 140 to 130 first week though

    jesus everyone figured that out like a month and a half ago where have you been
i have deduced the reason behind why and how this video is cursed for one this girl is highly attractive and her cosplay is actually good appealing the eyes of watchers her cosplay also reveals her stomach which is very nicely shaped not to skinny not fat not ripped but a really natural look its intriguing to look at her makeup is good as well it really brings out her eyes and makes her smile a lot more appealing secondly i myself find myself fascinating at the way she moves its very smooth and fun to watch for example the spin at the start that she stops suddenly and kind of leans foreword then quickly straightens out it is very well executed and goes along with the beat making it satisfying to watch im most obsessed with the part however when the song says you got a boyfriend and she is kind of bobbing her way gracefully towards the camera the way she moves most of her entire body when walking is really satisfying she even does it to the beat of the song and if also like to point out her shoulder movements throughout most of the video they add a lot more energy to her movements on that note that leads us to my third point the song and how she utilizes the song to compliment her movement this song and lyrics itself are not that great but the woman singing the song sings it well that however is not the reason why this matters though the voice of the actual singer really fits the girl in the video it not only compliments her cosplay making it cuter but also compliments her dancing as i mentioned earlier the way she moves is simply satisfying to watch and part of that is because of how seamlessly and smoothly she move to the song the spinning at the beginning goes very well with the chorus ending in the background
  that little booping of her chest after the spin i mentioned earlier is timed when the rapper makes a rapper sound that transitions into the girls part what does he even say is it like bite or bye or something idek makes it mesmerizing and satisfying to watch her head boops are very well timed too when the song says hit or miss as well as the huh after she moves her head slightly too the beat that makes it better than had she not of moved her head and then the little bopping/walking thing she does that i mentioned earlier is so perfectly timed to the beat and the words of the song and then my last point is her facial expressions obviously she has a beautiful face but there are smaller things she does that bring out some of her key features the way her eyebrows move is one she raises them a bit to help her eyes look bigger at some points her smile is simply a work of art its just very very pretty and natural not much i can say on it it just makes people happy well actually that wasnt my last point i found myself watching the video and getting sad that it ended because its mesmerizing to watch than i realized that each time it repeated i was hoping that it wouldnt cut off at the end thus rewatching it thinking maybe there is more this is probably because the song cuts at the end leaving a feeling of incompleteness to the video making me want to rewatch it to find the completeness if that makes sense because it stops in the middle of a song and her dance move you feel as if there is more making you want to rewatch it under the illusion that there is more i guess omg perfect timing i literally started typing this at around 30 minutes and it finished when i finished my last sentence well than yeah i guess im done i might of repeated myself a bit but i was trying to get the point across i hope i helped people understand why they kept watching the video
  
/fa/ops will defend this
  you sneaker nigger
  yeah ive heard about the creasing thing is particularly bad with these shoes
  brogue  tan chunky wedge sole  jesus christ where did you find this abomination
  not chunky at all sneaker nig
  probably made from some shit leather my club c are holding very well in my experience between reebok adidas and nike reebok make the most solid shoes and nike makes things that fall apart
  this is why i stopped wearing sneakers quality is so shit nowadays
  some sneakers are made like shit  some leather shoes are made like shit as well
  /fa/ never liked reecuck    we nike gang here
  cant tell if troll or newfag
  hes right before stans became popular it was all about flyknits   oldheads hate the new adidas abominations and their old stuff is super low quality
  went off topic kinda but reeboks is owned by adidas   the only pair of reeboks i have is uncomfortable af despite looking so chunky and cushioned
  flyknit and roshes were in with the beginnings of techwear but people were also into the qasa reebok pumps were also looked at as an alternative to dbss sneakers as they were also high tops and dbss uses reebok soles
  when they crease you get ruggedcore
i have c85s and theyre holding up extremely well and are my comfiest sneak
  roshes  those shoes were teenage normietier when i went to school
  that looks terrible at least post a good example
  is that why you posted this angle that hides it lol insecure cunt
we all know that generalisations are bad and not all people in a sub culture are the same but has anyone actually encountered or befriended a rich asian hypebeast how do they act i see them around but they literally always are looking at there phones so its hard to gauge how they act
  insecure obnoxious superficial hypocritical
  im just curious about it how did the encounter play out
  i had an extremely handsome trendy asian in one of my college courses once we were going around the room doing introductions and i got shy and started sperging out so him and his friend put their heads down and started to silently guffaw into their arms ever so often theyd look back at me to watch me bumble over my words and laugh harder one of my most painful social experiences desu
  he likes how i dress and i sell him weed so hes chill with me
  what are you a male or female
  theres a youtuber named leafy watch some of his videos
  why
  because they might have been laughing not at your awkwardness but because they friend isnt gay
yes i do actually we both kinda use each other because that exactly what the mainland chinese concept of friendship is what you can get from another person and to what extent are they worth keeping around    go to uni in toronto   rich asians fobs everywhere  always helped this one dude chang out in tutorials because i dont mind teaching people english and its a good way to pick up some basic mandarin  hes one of the nicer fobs as the money hasnt fully taken over his mind  occasionally would buy me shit when we hang out  got a free stoney sweater once  i help him with fob girls believe it or not basically his hype man  its not even hard these girls just want someone with more wealth than them  literally have to sit next to chang every time he starts talking to one of them so he doesnt fuck up  if he does fuck one he always asks me what i should buy her as if its customary    every time we go out to eat he pays  every time we go shopping hell buy something for me  dude has other friends as do i but when we chill its like he feels the need to flaunt his wealth even more so long as he doesnt brag about it
  w2c chang
  i love your optimism never let the world ruin you
some rich kid from thailand came to my school last year as a transfer student he was actually really chill and nice massive hypebeast tho wore supreme yeezy and fear of god to school on a daily basis
  maybe he secretly wants to be your sugar daddy
  give chang my number
  getting laughed at by chinks  sad
i befriended one from macau for a semester before he graduated he was chill and easy to talk to but his tastes were straight hypebeast we were both lazy and underachievers so that played a role in bringing us together
  fpbt
  we both kinda use each other because that exactly what the mainland chinese concept of friendship is  this is literally how they do things its bizarre
i know a bunch of fobs but i dont think any of them are rich and if they are they dont really show it    im from europe though going to a top 20 engineering uni

  i dont know where you live but there are laws that regulate proper hygiene in a work environment basically this dude would need to make some serious changes or leave
  im sure of that too but he doesnt work on the same floor as me so i couldnt really care if the people it impacts dont have the balls to complain then thats their problem smells pretty nice in my office desu
  based let em suffer
  black and brown  1 clash rule
  yeah whatever
  brogues  black pants and brown boots  embarrassing
  he cant pull off black and brown  i feel sad for you
   pants and brown boots  nothing wrong with it   i aint wearing gay blue chinos
i hate blue jeans/trousers so im only allowed to wear black shoes or what
  brogues  brown boots  black pants  fuck huge ronald mcdonald toebox    how could everything go so wrong
  another time i got told i shouldnt ever wear black boots so couldnt care less about that     and the toebox isnt huge those are wingtips underneath

    my legs look too thick cause of the angle
  peepee

    blue and brown     what did you mean by this
  these are very comfy shoes      based beat up cons
so where did this dont do brown boots with black pants meme come from
 hedi runways for slp had tobacco boots with black jeans the meme is mainly for lighter tan boots with dark pantaloons
  i think its mostly for formal wear but some anons think the rule always apply
brown boots look better than black ones with black pants     black boots just blend with the pants and become unnoticeable
  if i were any more yuppie id puke harvard/ yale enrollment applications
  zip up boots  oh youre a woman

  nice cankles manlet

i live in a logging town with 20k population  filson and red wing are seen as grails  wearing any kind of buttondown shirt is seen as being dressed up or fancy  mah boi this coat is what all true laborers strive for
can confirm in the real world where nobody has heard of mfa muh heritage raw denim or other internet fashion circlejerkery filson coats and such get endless compliments also that collar looks comfy as fuark
  wearing any kind if button down shirt is seen as being dressed up or fancy    ever heard of pendleton
  well youre good that shit looks god tier compared to the calvin klein diesel and levis shit i see on the street every day nostalgia bump for the shitty ytp reference
30 shipped    the model is a shapeless sack of shit so i imagine id look better no its the real blue camo and i wouldnt wear them both together larp style you wear pants separately and the wind breaker separately opinions
30 isnt any amount really and theres a chance its sick pattern is beautiful pants are too baggy to work but jacket is nice if its a nice material its a nice purchase
the material looks paper thin and weirdly silky but maybe the jacket would look cool with something if youve got money to spare go ahead

  what do you think bros
where do you guys buy your sweatpants/joggers ive bought uniqlo previously and they are really crap outside of some items like their supima cotton and uniqlo u stuff uniqlo in general really looks cheap really crappy seams and texture on their joggers    pic related will eventually go down to 20 and im wondering if i have any other decent options without obnoxious branding/logo even a small icon on the front is a dealbreaker for me
where to get quality winter scarf that isnt really wide but i can wrap around my face if needed prefer something that isnt wool because i dont want to deal with the moisture issue and drying

  reddit is your containment go back there so i can delete your diary entries
is camo a good color for a parka i kinda like pic related but im not sure if camo is the smartest choice of color when it comes to parkas   yes i know canada goose is a meme brand but im not necessarily gonna buy a cg i just wanna know if the color is okay on this type of coat
  i dont think its a good choice unless you have multiple parkas and can switch out between them for different styles
  the issue is that all my coats are neutral colored so this would be something different i do think camo can be pulled off and i think its more fun looking but im concerned that itll be harder to find good fits with it
  thats shit tier camo anon if youre going to wear a camo parka might as well just go full autism and get flecktarn id recommend skipping out on camo though and going for a nice olive its the most tasteful choice in milsurp/military inspired parkas basically either dress like dylan or get a proper parka most camo is tasteless anyways especially that meme shit
  what makes it shit and what is good camo not agreeing or disagreeing with you i just wanna know why is camo just always shit on expensive stuff
  well admittedly im not the most knowledgeable person about types of camo but that pattern is a bit of a meme and imo tacky flecktarn is also a meme but for a different reason its overly edgy but what i can comment more on is that buying a non military parka with party city lookin ass camouflage on it is probably not a good idea camouflage on expensive fashion pieces is tryhard and it doesnt help that the camo on that one is cliche like i said before if you really want camo just buy actual military surplus but if i were you id just go with something not patterned i apologize for how shittely im expressing my thoughts its late and im not really all there basically i think what is tacky about a parka like that is the cliche camo and the fact that its expensive shit trying to look like military shit if you want a military type parka why not just get the real deal be it with actual camouflage or not i apologize i did the best i could lol
  i think the reason why i am kinda drawn to the camo is because i think it pops out more compared to more simple or safe colors but i definitely see what you mean
  for longevity and flexibilities sake i would avoid camo unless youre really into it youll probably end up wishing an expensive jacket like that one was a different colour
  thats the thing that makes me not completely sold on camo i might like it as a 22 year old but am i still gonna like it 5 10 years down the road if i still own it
  yeah mate i do agree with you so i guess the question then is do you want to go with a safe parka or something a bit more risky if you think you can pull off camo go for it id just go with actual milsurp and maybe a more unusual pattern like pic rel flecktarn like i said also a meme but most people wouldnt know another benefit of milsurp is that its a lot cheaper so less regret it seems you just want a camo parka to mix things up occasionally id go with something cheap and authentic ie milsurp with a pattern you like dont go above 100
  forgot picture also reading what you just said go cheap and if you like it in 5 years great if you dont then its no big loss
  its god damn woodland camo you zoomer boomers served in military with that pattern uniforms
  yes i am aware and no shit that doesnt make it any less tacky on an 1000 parka
are you starting some kind of faggot militia lol

  yes and well fight the enemies of the united states not with guns and bombs but with how fabulous and gay we are well buttfuck isis to death

  lol ur a fucking nerd dude you need to return to reality
  t doesnt wear leather boots and raws     post your boots then
  are your boots moc toe you might as well just pour soi milk all over your legs and feet
cant return my 1000 miles now looks like im stuck with experiencing the chromexcel meme
asked in the last thread but got no answer because it was near the end i think     anyone heard of or know anything about the clarks macoronic hi could pick a pair up for a bargain price but struggling to find any information on them
i got a pair of churchs black chelseas for my birthday can i wear them with anything  my usual outerwear is pic related but i wonder if chelseas would look out of place with a carhartt jacket  generally speaking what should i wear black chelseas with sorry if thats a retarded question i dont usually wear boots
thoughts on grinders i just ordered these
  i dont know about this specific model but i returned my 1460s in favour of clarks boots they are much more comfortable to me and they arent as bulky as docs if you like that im sure they will work out for you
ive got wide feet already feel somewhat tied up in docs do i risk buying the solovair derbies 
do i cop some wolverine kilometer boots for 52 dollars
  it might not be so bad what color are they if theyre black youre fucked though brown is alright though theyre gonna crease to hell regardless
what are you going to do if i want to post about boots outside of this thread op real talk what the fuck are you going to about it huh fucking bitch you gonna stop me huh pussy whats up
  probably just keep living my life and not care what some random person does on a japanese cartoon image board
do i cop these varvatos  i need a pair of dressier shoes and am not looking to buy anymore wolverines/red wings/daytons
solovair 11 eye hawkins boot
  theyre black 
  depends on your desired aesthetic the top black layer will scratch off extremely easily and once its gone its gone the brown underneath will show through if youre trying to look nice and dressier this wont work but if you want that worn in beat to hell look it works
im looking to pick up some red wing boots but cant decide on what model to get both the iron ranger and beckman ones seem solid but im not a huge fan of the white stitching on either of them what i want is a proper black boot are there any alternatives will the seam go black over time because of bootcare products
  red wing merchants in black spitfire
  i did check those out too but the pattern on the sole isnt really what i need that and they look more grey than black
are boots a type of shoe
  does the merchant come in black i cant remember but that easily their best looking boot   the blacksmith comes in black i think they even have a couple of black options also look at the williston its a new model that i know comes in all black
  whats your size i have some blacksmiths in spitfire black that are too narrow for me i want to sell them
  im getting these tomorrow    thoughts
  dont   if youre white they will look off the interior and the sole suck ass for the price youre better off getting solovairs or even docs
  nope  only cop varvatos mainline those are from the usa diffusion you can tell by the zipper pull and theyre made in china shit thatll fall apart in a few months
what kind of boots are gotos when it comes to business casual work environment    i usually wear chinos for pants if that matters
opinions on aldo
copped both of these boots on black friday did i do good    alfred sargent camrbidge in pebble grain navy and the crockett  jones coniston in roughout
  theyre not as bad as everyone says  ive had mine for eight years heavy wear no problems  the leather definitely gets beat up but if you keep them oiled up theyll last a long ass time
  bottom of the barrel fashion boots  almost anything is better      pebbles are ugly roughouts are nice
  at least get one of the timberland boot company models that have some semblance of good construction and comfort
  thanks famalam
  dont like pebble in general or just those
need boots for winter in ottawa any recs
  
  in general
  fair enough
  anyone
    black chelsea boots are semiformal    dark denim and an overcoat are a good match carhartt hoodie is a little too casual
  if youre white they will look off    but why though
  i have dark denim but i dont own any formal outerwear other than the carhartt jacket i just have a black parka and a black corduroy/shearling collar jacket
  black parka and black jacket work fine    hoodie not so much
  got it thanks  i thought chelseas worked with most things but i guess thats only the case for suede
i search for boots in this kinda style but not rick owens price level
w2c these boots
  theyre just roughout combat boots  you could even have a cobbler add a side zipper if youre looking for that feature      could be any combat boots dude
  could be any combat boots dude  but they have a slim profile and no toe cap which i see on most combat boots    im new to boots so im probably just dont know what to search for
  because theyre basically made for black people you fucking idiot what country are you from
  got it theyre a fashion take on combats try common projects viberg or dayton
  norway
  dear god do not buy these
  common projects  those look perfect but are there any cheaper alternatives
  surplus  corcoran 1697 maybe  not all service boots have cap toes and theyre not all super bulky  just look around surplus sites at the different models produced  make sure to check out boots from various armies around the world
just copped these for winter did i fuck up
this is now leg general
anyone know of any green or olive combat/ combat inspired boots and not the sage af ones
  yeah timbs are a ny nigger thing
  these are saint laurent ranger boots most likely the double zips if i can tell from the zips on the inside
what do you guys think of these
  so because some hoodrat across the atlantic decides to own a certain type of footwear that somehow excludes me from wearing it
  its not fashionable and will look like shit if you wear it why dont you wear normal clothes for someone in norway and not nigger boots
  you can wear a clown suit for all we care  just know that the average person who wears tims looks like this which is fine do whatever you want
  but timbs dont even look good though why would you even want to wear something ugly that is only associated with niggers
  clarks macoronic hi  they look like good boots if you can get a good deal go for it
  those are both great looking boots you did well anon
  get the timbs bro dont let these retards tell you differnet
  who gives a fuck what other people like you like them thats all that matters
  roughout combat boots  can you give me some direction please im new to boots my price point is about 300 but if its high quality im willing to splurge a bit
  this bottom ones look great how much did you cop them for   the top ones look good too pebble isnt my thing though but the boot itself looks really good
own pair of irs  cant really wear them at all since they dont fit my current style  look like shit anyway because i have large feet and am a skelly
  brokeboy here i love the look of these ann demeulemeester boots but its out of my price range so i want to get cheaper alternatives any recs  im also new to boots since ive recently moved out of a tropical country
  i like them
  400 gbp for the bottom ones      cheers
  i absolutely love these kind of boots how to style them just dress preppy make sure not to tuck
  dark jeans and a shirt always works
  cheaper alternatives  palladium baggy black canvas dont fold it youre welcome
  im looking for that particular style too kind of like a charcoal/distressed black    shame these are out of stock in most sizes   com/au/asosdesign/asoslaceupbootsinblackleatherwithribbedsole/prd/8396720
  austrian parameme boots
  seems kind of informal for boots like those
  jeans and a shirt always works  in a garage
looking for boots that i can wear in the office w/ black jeans and polo/shirt/tshirt but also in 20c swedish winter when walking the dog etc    pic related are särmä ankle boots which look pretty nice but any recommendations are appreciated
is it possible to wear the austrian meme boots without looking like a larper
  not meme enough
  either those or the m77s leka has good shit
what does /fa/ think of cowboy boots i used to pull them off really well in high school back in texas but i feel like it may not look as good as i remember
  theyve been replaced by the service boot
  kickass i already have those
thoughts on rm williams any boots of similar quality/build
  rm williams are nice boots but should only be purchased at discount the price hike has been too much they usually can be found 50 off during sales a friend of mine got a pair during a sale a few weeks ago for only 215    at full price you are better off getting crockett  jones or cheaney instead
      only get them if marked down too expensive at full price
  clarkdale bud right yeah i like em
i finally ordered some iron rangers im about to join the meme army at last
  thanks anon i think id rather go for these since the m77s are a bit high for casual office wear
do any of ya recommend buying from here
  not if you are buying that
  aww i think they look nice
    story et fall is a lot better and cheaper
  what makes sef better do they have any nice zip ups
  death to zipper boots
any outfit ideas getting them today
  they have the best slp copies on the market theyve gotten the fit and shape to practically the exact same as fw13 hedi boots even better than current vaccarello boots imo also they have the same leather supplier as hermes if you care about that stuff
urgh i want these so much i wish i wasnt poor
  im not a fan of bulky lace up boots good zip ups fit my frame better 6 145    thanks anon ill look into them just impulse bought some cps so ill have some more time to look into boots
  shia labeef
  toebox is completely different its one of the most round flat toe boxes ive ever seen
  its always good to have goals
anyone here have any recommendations for decent quality new cowboy boots specifically ropers i mostly buy vintage stuff from ebay but would like to break in a pair myself soon
c/n
looking for some tall black nonleather milspo boots for the winter    budget 300
  whats your budget cause for cheap the austrian meme is as close as youre gonna get the toe box is unstructured so itll flatten out with wear like in pic related  theres also the belgian army gp boot but it doesnt go quite as high as the austrian meme    your best bet though is to save up around 500 and watch the secondhand market grailed rak and yjp with some patience not only can you get gently used anns for that price but guidi as well 995 or 991 are the models you want you might also wanna look around for buterro combats they dont produce them regularly but theyve made some really great ones over the years and they often can be had for 300
should i use saddle soap or mink oil to condition smooth black leather on a chukka
          i dont know why you always post those default timberlands that niggers like  i dont even like that color and heritage ones with proper leather and different color like picrelated are way better they are also insulated and good for winter even in russia
  belgian combat boots abl combats are indestructible and very good value for money i wouldnt get them if its ann d youre lookng for sure they look decent once beat to shit but theyre a far cry from a sleak high fashion boot
really want dull brown cowboy boots but i dont want to be an autist is a squared toe chelsea boot the best way to pull off a more casual and acceptable version     what other boots have that narrow sloped back heal
  what is the name of this pair of boots
  bobby
  anon in case youre in germany and they have your size just copped these   they only had 41 and i am between 42 and 43 but they say they fall out bigger
what do you guys think of these are they fine if i cant really afford the next price tier right now
  look like ugly indy boot ripoffs
  theyre ok
  they are haha  jcrew kenton      cool good enough for me thanks
wearing reddit leather in current year
  i dont know but theyre rick owens
do you anons have any experience with wolverine boots im looking to cop pic related but i havent heard much about the producer
  theyre garbage but like decent garbage garbage that you feel bad about buying but not as bad as if you had bought timbs or something   glaring quality control issues their leather is some of the lowest quality chromexcel that you can find almost like its the pieces viberg and whites and alden and others wouldnt buy so they dumped it on wolverine expect terrible creasing and ugly loose grain very quickly also they have a leather sole which is terrible on anything but dress shoes   but again at least its not docs or timbs or something trash like that maybe give chippewa a look first as something in a similar price range and aesthetic bit with a bit higher quality
how do these used fyre chelsea boots look
  like shit
fr though i need functioning winter boots and id like something lunar
  then start a lunarcore thread and go there
  thanks im 42/43 also though
  depends where you are in the us it seems rmw just swap aud for usd with the same numerals not even rmws country store discount but the full catalogue price seems obscene
bump
  just bought a black pair of 1k miles comfortable feeling but shit compared to red wings ridiculously easy to fuck the leather up already getting them resoled so i dont slip and die if i didnt get them for super cheap id be for sure disappointed no way theyre worth 365
im thinking of getting some oxblood iron rangers
    aight thanks anons i did some general research and they seem pretty sketchy definitely not worth the price id have to pay here scandi im not so much after the work boot as i am a pair of black boots that arent too dressy ive looked at berwick for instance but theyre both too narrow and stiff for my tastes
  this is the boot thread for boots
  shut up nigger
dayton service boots are goat i have these from the wh collab theyre the only work boot silhouette i like besides vibergs 2030 last which is basically a replica of daytons
  laces look strange are there any recommendations for the lace length eg on a work/service boot
tfw fell for the thursday meme    its been nearly a week and i think my black captains are starting to finally break in are there ways of removing scuffs or having small ones appear less unsightly     also the rim around the outsole appears to be painted black would polish return its original appearance
  i was gonna get some but went with whites mp service boot instead because i felt more comfortable with their sizing with whites i know i go half size down and it fits perfectly daytons sizing had me worried people say all sorts of things like full size down and up a width to just half size down and everything in between   how did you size yours
  with black youre pretty much stuck just using shoe polish to fill them in black is really bad when it comes to scuffs and stuff
   t guy spamming the board asking about chelsea boots
alright /fa/gs can someone recommend me a good boot for someone living in a snowy region of the us one that will go well with jeans and not look hillbilly
whats a good brand to start into the world of boots with low to medium price range been wearing docs for quite some time but id like to have something a bit more adultish preferably brown    pic unrelated obviously
  s o l o v a i r
  
  i just use 76 inch leather laces and wrap it around the ankle once with leather laces you can cut it to any size you like though      im a size 105 on a us brannock scale and a 95 fits me fine so id size down 1 mine came with ee width as standard i believe i could probably size down to an e wdith since i get a bit of heel slippage
does anyone know where i can get cheap chelsea boots  its for a one time only event so i dont want to spend a lot on them
where do you guys buy your boots im looking for some leather boots for winter but i really dont want to spend 200 for something just yet  t no clue about shoes
are john doe boots worth getting im worried about the overall quality of them
smashed a tinder thot while wearing these     just pulled down my pants and went to town on her
  absolutely based
post memes you will never fall for again  chromexcel   leather soles  structured toe boxes  speed hooks
chippewa seems to be the only brand in my budget does anyone have any experience with em hows their quality
    this review is about as good as it gets so decide for yourself   id place them lower than red wing but way higher than trash like wolverine
  those are cool    i want to saysomething good but the dont look very good pass    whats holding you back    hm should have some    excellent
  should i avoid moc toes completely buddy is offering to sell me a lightly used pair of black red wings for 90
also available in brown40 euroslast stock
  why dont you like speed hooks i think theyre a godsend
  kek
  moc toe is an abomination
  how are speed hooks bad
just bought these look pretty gud
  docs they absolutely fucked me over
i promised to an anon some threads back to let him know if the solovair derbies were any good  they are but only because of their price and looks  the soles are worse than docs the leather kind of feel plasticy though that may change with further wear the laces are just straight up bad and too short  still theyre pretty comfy look great arent that pricy and are resistant to rain mud and shit its not like you have any other choice if you want these kind of boots at that price anyway    subscribe to my blog for more
  i think falling for the docs meme is a right of passage that any boot fan must overcome
  i think that was me thanks for the update they sound a little bit disappointing
  didnt find a lot of bad things to say apart from what i already said so its just the structure of my post theyre definitely good but be sure youre gonna wear them with your outfit otherwise itd be just 230 down the drain
  there is no excuse for falling for docs ever
  why do you think they look great    imo theyre a very plain black boot
  yeah thats why theyre simple but elegant dont really know how to put it
  pics
doc and solovair discussion happening in this thread   please do not make your own thread so i can filter it
    those toes look bad especially on the left
do any of you guys have experience with bunny/mickey boots how warm are they i might just take the autism of wearing them in public for the sake of warm feet should i get the black pair or the white pair
what sort of colors for dark brown boots need a new coat/jacket
  does anyone know of any higher quality alternative to this kind of boot the ones ive found have all had nonblack details that that havent worked for me or the weird bulbous toe of red wings
  thats because its bullshit fake distressed leather its like buying preripped jeans with fake fades in them
  bought a pair last year super super warm and perfect for wet/snowy climates get the black ones they are way easier to style
  cheaney trafalgar     thanks    tbqh im still not impressed but perhaps they look really good irl
  extremely warm i live in alaska and theyre the gold standard for winter /out/ings id go as far as to say theyre too warm to be comfortable indoors
trying to choose between sof corcoran imports or the varusteleka jump boots both in brown ive read that the leka boots have pretty soft soles that wear down quick and want to hear some opinions on both pairs planning on using them as just a milspo boot and not going to be doing any hikes as i already plan on resoling my austrian memes for that purpose     also as an aside hows the leather on the leka boots in comparison to the corcorans do they patina as well as ive seen the corcs and are they as what i assume to be high quality as the corcs cheers in advance
cowboyfag coming through
close id on these
  bruh whats marty mcfly doing with an ak 47

im looking to buy my first pair of boots should i just get a pair of clarks and call it a day or is there a better pair to start out with especially considering that i live in new york and am from chicago and as such spend a lot of time in cold/snowy weather
first time i wear them they are very nice    lets go boys
  id on these
    super expensive but they will literally last a lifetime or two
  id
  i agree generally speaking docs does make some decent looking shoes though the mie picrel i would buy honestly     guidi
  thats because the model is swimming in them mine fit more like these      bullshit fake distressed leather  lolno its thick genuine leather and not that meme chromexcel either it was tied up and distressed in water so the leather is soft as fuck
  seconded im looking for this as well dont care about the hillbilly thing though lol
these look great dont now about the quality for this price tho anyone have these on here

looking to cop artisinal black boots  7 eyelets that would fit a tts 42
      
  talking about secondhand ann d dvn guidi ma etc    thanks tho
    okay go for it idk what kind of response youre looking for    maybe start with a grailed search for carpe diem since they do a 7 eye boot guidi 995 are also a solid choice though theyre 8 eye instead of 7 but the eyelets are discreet enough that it doesnt make much of a difference
  ive been searching depop grailed yjp every day for over a month closest i came to buying anything was some rick gy flexs but they ended up being size 40 one dude has had an amazing pair of ann ds listed on grailed for a month and even bumped them this week but hasnt responded to any messages or offers    was hoping that someone in here is looking to sell a pair
  ah fair enough be patient my dude its better to wait for the thing you really want than to buy something thats almost like it  that said here are a few links for you around the 500 mark id go for any of these over rick desu not knocking his footwear but the difference in construction between his stuff and more artisanal brands is night and day            
  ive looked at all three of those pairs and sadly none of them are what id like the augusta would need to be dyed with saphir or something and i feel like thats blasphemy  the wjk are inbetween grey and black and the carpe diem are suffed
  jessuz christ kid calm down
  if thats the case then id definitely double down on the call for patience  you know exactly what you want out of a boot and i guarantee that close enough wont cut it keep looking and theyll come up eventually
should i buy them guys
does story et fall fit true to size
pic related is 300 dollars which i dont have rn anything similar but for cheaper

  what did you pay for the cambridge ive been watching them in blue for a bit now
  you can still get them at 25 at afinepairofshoescouk    use blackfriday2018 at checkout    you wont get a better deal than that on the blue ones they are discontinued and you probably wont see them at this price again
  where do i cop
can somebody give me a quick rundown on cowboy boot manufacturers
where to buy new austrian paraboots in europe preferably germany or austria i can only find used ones
  the 25 sale on them ends in 12 hours
  justins are undoubtedly the best

  austrian paraboots    search for feldschuhe leicht theyre available used every now and then but usually lower quality than these babies
  danke šén
is there any way to flatten the toe on my khatadins theyre so comfy and gorgeous i love everything except the raised tow looks kind of funky great boots
leather laces why
  tecovas
brown or black im torn
  id say black is for formal only
can a manlet wear taller boots or would it just look weird
  why not   are you referring to rawhide laces fucking thursday boots use kevlar laces who cares laces are laces
  ok for formal use and for edgy cunts
  black literally goes with anything
  half will say all brown boots look like shit  half will say all black boots look like shit    choose wisely
jodhpurs y/n
  no
  i cant really think of a situation they would be better than any other kind of more versatile boot
  more versatile boot  like
  chelsea
  fuck off chelsea boots are trash an numales and actual faggots wear them they look bad 99 of the time
  w2c link
  but chelseas are simply downgraded jodhpurs
  dayton service boots i think the ones in the pic are an old wh collab      sure
everyone insulted my boots now im sad and looking for black nonbrogue boots    these    look great but i dont see how the price is justified
  i likeem wear what you want
  those are the same boots as the op pic but in a collaboration between dayton and some shitty brand to make a fake pre distressed looking boot   why just buy quality boots and wear the hell out them and let the leather speak for itself instead of buying pre worn looking shit     anyway 
  i am even more torn between the two
    yeah i like them too
  he believed the ugly brown boots meme
how bad did i do
  brown seems to be more versatile in my opinion
  but i dont want to have ugly brown boots shouted at me
  both honestly i just brought brown because its a bit more casual and pairs well with more
  look great but i dont see how the price is justified    theyre at the same quality and tier as vibergs at least they used to be heard dayton has been bought out and qc went down       those are the same boots as the op pic but in a collaboration between dayton and some shitty brand to make a fake pre distressed looking boot   why just buy quality boots and wear the hell out them and let the leather speak for itself instead of buying pre worn looking shit     perhaps because they look better than the nondistressed version right off the bat also wh is or used to be a great streetwear brand which makes me think youre just a poor pleb with poor taste
  barbanera
anyone have any experience with frye i bought some brown boots for half off and they look very nice but im concerned with how long theyll last judging from reviews online   i live in socal though so no weather
  frye boots were the toughest boots you could purchase back in the 70s idk about now tho
  ugly as fuck take that unichel shit back to 2ch
  but those aint unichel its just a maymay
  also wh is or used to be a great streetwear brand which makes me think youre just a poor pleb with poor taste  wanna know how i know youre not old enough to be on this website
what are the cheap version of daytons service boot id love to but i cant really justify that cost right now
  what are the cheap version of daytons service boot  doc martens lol
  welp i guess ill just wait
  honestly anything in that tier including dayton whites viberg alden truman and others are that price for a reason you either shell out that much or buy an inferior boot for less   theyre in that investment terrible where your it costs more but will last forever to the point you get your money back in how much youll have saved over the years not rebuying shitty cheaper stuff over and over
  dayton whites viberg alden truman    now look at all these brands i can never buy anything from     t europoor
  tier not terrible yes i am phoneposting at work
how to darken my boots
  you can gradually apply shoe cream thats a tone darker     but i dont recommend it 
  a lot of conditioners will darken them just read reviews and youll find the ones that do
  i dont recommend it   can i ask you why
what am i supposed to wear with black boots other than black denim anything else just feels off
  i wear mine with jeans and chinos all the time and it fine
  these are fresh where can i cop
anyone know what those 40 boots kanye was wearing recently are id post the picture but i cant find it anywhere
  you sound like a pedo and you dont know jack shit
  yeah its in your head you just got to get used to it

thoughts on these badboys
  i would
i ever feel need to own another pair of boots itll be pair of these
should i get these vibrammed before wearing them outdoors
  no just return them
  the laces will fit the boots properly once the leather is worn in and you can actually get the boot laced shut properly also pvc soles feel like pvc what did you expect
  if you dont wanna spend a lot then buy something with a really aggressive tread pattern on the soles
  look more towards surplus as thats where youll find the best deals austrian paratrooper/meme boots are a good shout

  i kinda want these but i dont know how theyd style with non streetwear fits all the photos i see with them are with earth toned joggers and oversized hoodies
  i ordered these from foot locker got the order and payment confirmation but the order disappeared from my account fuck is up with that 
  sounds like something you should take up with footlocker and not a 4chan thread friend
  i like these i want to wear them only on sundays with white socks
  one of the ugliest yeezy silhouettes imo
shit go dummy hard my g
  i got the blush ones theyre really comfy but they make feet look 3 sizes larger also they are surprisingly easy to style
  best yeezy imo i got the black ones then sold them they were extremely comfy and light although im used to jack purcells and derbies so any shoe is comfy af compared to those lol
i fuck with them hard  the blush ones heattt
best yeezy shoe by a long shot every colorway so far has been nice in its own way
  the black ones are hideous

care about fashion  uses android    what are you doing
  filtering plebs normies and pseuds apples proprietary system is the worst the specs are not superior compared to other flagships and the design has not been remarkable since the 5s  hurrr ur just mad because you cant afford one  equally terrible reasoning many people can easily afford one thats why you see so many colored women talking endlessly about theirs if they had better hardware if the softwared wasnt cordoned off and if the design was better id get one cant wait for this notch trend to blow over
i took this
  now explain that to everyone who silently judges you for using android also checked
  not op but
  no need to anyone who is so shallow as to pass judgment for what kind of phone others use i am glad to have them out of my life
  i have to signal status to multiple subcultures and android allows ricing which signals stronger to a lot of groups than the cultural capital deficit of green bubbles
  i think its a symbol from a hugo boss collection
  says that unironically on a fashion board
  i am into fashion but i approach it as a collecting hobby like collecting coins or books i do not judge or look down on anyone for not being into fashion some people just want to dress to look passable and thats okay just like some people are not into cars they just want an appliance to take them from point a to point b enjoying fashion does not automatically mean you have to develop a superiority complex its rather silly really if you are going to develop a superiority complex it could at least be around something productive like fitness or owning your own business

denim jacket recs  tried a levis trucker jacket and honest to god it looked like shit and the fit was all weird
  apc
all i want is a denim jacket that fits slim im too skinny for anything else
you have to break them in
just get the uniqlo one
topman and river island make good ones imo idk if theyre outside the uk tho
  thrift shop for a few years until you find one from the 70s
  have a sherpa lined levis one and it sucks quality is off for the price
  skinny boy reporting   got mine from the little girls rack at my local thrift shop looks like it was tailored for me weird
  why not ebay then
dark blue always looks like shit get faded/light blue    also try sizing up for a loser fit i got an xl and im usually a medium/large in most brands it fits me perfectly except for the length of the arms so i just roll the cuffs up once
im going to try wearing suspenders because belts are just uncomfortable there are casual suspenders that go under clothing and then traditional suspenders that go over clothing of course    do any of you have experience with this personally i anticipate a feeling of great liberation dont touch pic relateds suspenders hes very defensive of them
wear suspenders over an undershirt and under your actual shirt dont have them visible unless your older than 70
  belts are just uncomfortable   t fatty fatty 2x4
  if youre dressed formally your shirt needs to be tucked no      t meme  incel memes arent /fa/
  formally yes but a button up doesnt always need to be tucked
 nb im from the uk we call suspenders braces here suspenders are what hold stockings up    do it i recently switched from belt to braces and its genuinely one of the best decisions ive ever made i have quite a large belly i wear 40 waist and have always found belts uncomfortable to wear around my actual waist so my trousers would always fall down as i walked or if i bent over or when i was sitting for long periods switching to braces stopped all of this i never have to hitch my jeans up when im walking or worry about my asscrack showing if i bend down its also much more comfortable i can tuck my shirts in and they stay tucked in and i look slimmer because my belly isnt hanging over my waistband theyre also great if youre losing weight and have trousers that are a few inches too big because you dont have to cinch them to fit but you do need trousers that come up to your natural waist between the end of your ribcage and the top of your hip and you pretty much have to tuck your shirts in also if youre worried about feeling self conscious know that i work in a bar ie dealing with the public all day and the only comments i ever get about the braces are positive most people dont give a shit how you keep your trousers up
  thanks for the support dude yeah the only people who give me grief about how i dress are lady friends i dress terribly    belts seem like a bad invention to me everyone i know is relieved to take them off
  belts are fine if you have a narrow waist but yeah since most people wear their trousers around their hip bones rather than their waist belts are generally uncomfortable
  most people dont give a shit how you keep your trousers up  whenever i see someone wearing braces i immediately think fatty couldnt keep his trousers up
what is this style called do you know what i mean i see this type of style a lot in american movies depicting people living close to nature usually lower income familys i dont only see it in movies but it tends to be a thing in american culture in general reality tv shows documentarys etc fleece checkered shirts the classic cheap but thick hoodie with a wolf howling at the moon on it men usually wear checkered shirts or hunting gear something about this style really soothes me but its pretty hard to find clothes like this in stockholm as were very focused on high end fashion and sleek design you dont really see cheap and thrifted stuff a lot so what is this called anyways
there really isnt a name for it its just how people in the midwest and the south dress its kind of like the normal working class look for those states you might call some of them rednecks but a lot of it is just casual and workwear type stuff    speaking of thrifting in stockholm i wish it was easier i lived there for a few years and only went to a couple thrift stores and a couple vintage stores and they all sucked
its not a style its what people wear for convenience and comfort    just go to urban outfitters and grab some flannel shirts you prick
  yeah i just tought of that theyre like rednecks but sophisticated where can i buy this stuff online and where to look for inspo
  go to any town in the midwest or southactually almost any relatively rural area in the us and look at what people wear     what you see in movies looks better because the clothes are picked by a stylist and tailored/fitted not picked off the rack at the nearest walmart
  not joking watch old episodes of cops documentaries on the kkk moonshining and meth production look up pictures of people that shop at walmart or people who work in steel mills generally anything that has to do with southern states and the working class in those states id associate it with low income families its so weird too because its such a plain way of dressing but its easily recognizable    buying online is another story you can buy a lot of the workwear stuff from tons of different online retailers but a lot of it is older stuff that you would have to thrift or buy from someone selling vintage online that might be hard though because not everyone that sells vintage online sells garbage
  hey you know my struggles im looking for that vintage working class comfy stuff just like you said new garbageclothes is just not aesthethics enough
  this particular image is very pacific northwest to me not so much south/midwest
      none of this is what op is talking about if they look like they have a high school diploma and not a ged its not right
  all of these dudes look like yuppies this is not what im looking for
  if youre op youre going to have a hard time finding this stuff in person if youre not op and youre in the us you could find everything you need in an hour at a few thrifts    it reminds me of the ozarks or the appalachians
teamsesh bones seems to be taking a lot of inspiration from that btw no
  so what youre saying is that they need a few more missing teeth
  its not even that those guys look like theyre ready to be taken on a guided hiking trip so the poor people dont touch their outfits that they worked so hard on its about dressing in a way that requires no more effort than psychically putting the clothes on your body
real inspo hours
  op here exactly
    i moved back a few years ago so i dont remember exactly but there are a few decent shops in jakobserg also the few vintage shops in gamla stan might have a few pieces but youd have to really look
  getting there think more cold
  midwest core    deep south core    cop is 90s core  guy in car is bum core    90s sitcom core    cousin fucker core
  does this count i dont even think any real people dress like that its mostly just hollywoods depiction of poorer clothing while still having it look clean fit well
where can i find this velvet longcoat thing its not on their store its part of their barocco line but i cant find it anywhere aristocratic as fuck
pls respon
    contact versace why the fuck are you asking us
be honest is it completely pointless to dress well if you arent attractive
    actually the other way around
everyone can be more attractive by dressing well relative to themselves
    not at all there are plenty of attractive people that are not conventionally beautiful
  yeah totally there are a lot of girls that like specific nieches of guys because of the way they look or general traits even if they wouldnt fall under the label of conventionally attractive i honestly think its more important to hit a nieche than to have the perfect genetics if youre the most attractive guy in the room youll know it if not then you really cant tell who will find you attractive
  this  if you want to fuck 6 girls you either you have to have great genetics or you work on style/personality to fuck altgirls
its called having a personality and experimenting with the impression you want to create
    monied  attractive  talented  personality    at minimum one is required but more is always better
  this is a 12/10
  fpbp
any chance someone can id this jacket
  nope thousands of different kinds of jackets are made every year nobody here is keeping track of all of it

waywt last one dying and full of awful fits
  talk shit post fit
last one hasnt even reached 300 yet fuck off
repost from other thread will come to rate later    man i hate this argument most of the posters who post fits and critique arent effay anyways
just me today before school ____
my room is a piece of shit
  generic all black fit    anyways not everyday is meant to be dressed up
  cool hair 
  back    yeah fair point the tneck if a midnight blue but it does blend in with the rest without making a significant contrast    always like your look but always wished you would lose maybe 5 lbs so your lengs were thinner the thighs always looked so tight    pants fit horribly make you look like you have wide hips    cant tell what youre wearing or how any of it fits
  pants fit horribly  cause of low angle and shitty lighting i think
  angles and lighting are def a big part of making fits/pics look great but i would reconsider those pants on you its easy to get swept up into older trends and high waist pants are pretty classic but the fit on those look like grandpa core rather than the more current fit people like to emulate
  thx
  would prefer a bit of a taper on those pants but good otherwise      lovely texture on those pants      this needs some structured element right now it kinda looks like pajamas
  gaylord
  most of the posters who post fits and critique arent effay anyways    like yourself anon  that looks retarded maybe whatever the hell your wearing looks cool to koreans or wherever your from but it looks ridiculous here in burgerland what size shoe are you lmfao you look like a 3rd grader with those floods too nothing about your fit looks cool man    your look is all over the place also clean up your room woman     different shoes maybe     everything fits good but the look itself is lame especially with your head area     put some od damn shoes on
  like yourself anon  absolutely yes lol im not going to pretend like ive been a longtime poster here or am effay but reading about/seeing how the board is in such a decline just makes me think most dont know what were talking about im absolutely okay with people shitting on me because that helps me reconsider things so if i could ask you for any advice to change things or if everythings irredeemable i would unironically appreciate it waywt threads have an awful rep for a reason and i dont think im above it i just feel more open to people telling me things than the average /fa/ poster
  taste is subjective  develop an actual identity and quit asking what other people think thats the reason this board is on a decline because people think this actually looks cool
first time poster also no mirror so using some window on the street roast my normie cuck core      cool and cringe at the same time    8 good as usual id on turtle neck sweater    4 what is this what are you doing    4 could be a 7 dont like shoes or jacket either pick a different jacket or go with less loud shoes    6 if your audience is leddit    7 not a fan of the sweater pants    78 not a fan of the shoes
  ididnt mean i would shape my whole identity and look from what people tell me on this board i take most advice from here with a grain of salt i think for me personally i post in waywt because i got rid of social media and just enjoy yous that being said i want to hope people dont think your pic is a good fit but fuck me who knows
  this fit  these rates    please tell me its a joke famalam
normie reposts from last thread
  fair enough sorry for coming off like a tool you seem more concious than most people here
  no problem anon take care fwiw you didnt come off as a tool and thanks for your words i agreed with everything you said
  nnnow kiss
  got an issue with my rates buddy boy
do i still look like rick astley      i like this a lot     try to think about coordination more maybe    i like this but the shoes     i like it    its okay    its not offensively bad    i dont think the colours fit
  i hate this meme
  looks better than most ppl simple and clean    seems like cool guy but personally not my taste    i like this clean semipreppiness jacket seems big on u tho    r8 my lil boi fit
  if by  because people think this actually looks cool  you mean the guy you posted wearing hba and givenchy he is cool its not as well thought out and adventurous as other types of avant garde fashion but its interesting and challenging enough to wear to blow the majority of outfits posted here or elsewhere online out of the water he obviously has enough money  to the best of my knowledge fakes werent produced of the shirt or necklace he is wearing  to buy this stuff and dress in a fairly loud way so i would say he is comfortable and happy with how he is dressed
glad it rained today
  can you please become a rick astley trip
  this is really good the colour coordination is really nice only point where the flow kinda breaks is where the skirt sits on the shirt dont know how to fix though
  good
  unit jacket and n64 shirt boy if u dont take that back to uo  no it cute tho  is right tho skirts a bit too high get it hemmed or something
              best in this thread    pic related repost
    thank you both yeah the skirt looks a little weird i think maybe its also because the shirt was a mens small so itd probably look cuter if it was tighter
da shuz r fresh
  ok tell me how i need to proceed
  whats ur ig king
  i love you
i wish the jeans were baggier desu        my loves looking good
  i like this one
  w2c jacket good outfit personal opinion though loud shoes shouldnt be paired with a loudish jacket go for different shoes overall really cool anon
  i was originally going to go with a coat rather than the jacket so i thought the pants would be better but ill try it next time silhouette looks great as usual but i dont like the shirt very much    its from eddie bauer hard to say much about your fit since it looks very plain and the angle you took the pic isnt very flattering but i would add some more color    mmwah    idk but the angle is doing you no favors reallly cant say much since i cant tell how anything fits    thanks the taper on your pants seem way too much makes you look really stocky and the sweater is pretty ugly    no ig sorry    like the top a lot but yeah baggy jeans would have been sick here idk if the ozweegos are right but i would have liked to see how they interact with looser bottoms
am i thicc enough
saint
talk fit post shit
is my jacket /fa/
  forgot pic
  expecting anything from waywt thread  thats where you went wrong
  an absolutely beautiful outfit ruined by the boots
  he doesnt know about the brown boot meme    learn to meme fren
its been so long why am i still here just to suffer  yeah thats a walmart realtree hat    aight as always    normie but i still think youre cute so whatever    there are people that like this my fits not better knees up you look fine cuffed up with those shoes tho    same menswear shit but its fine    i stopped giving a shit so id wear and have worn similar    i dont like shit like that but it fits how its supposed to    average young adult    see previous    a notch above average    things fit no other comment    neato    i dont even know colors match thats cool but an n64 shirt    more contemporary inoffensive    oh shit he got the payless champions    not everyones thing but i dig the early 00s thing you do    top notch twink vibes    laurent    its alright
  m8 i was in the same boat as you a few years ago  cant put on muscle or else the expensive leather wont fit anymore  it was worth it anyways that look is better on a stronger looking guy anyways you look like a bobblehead
  also dont listen to that guy telling you to drop 5 lbs lol no conception of how people look in motion in relation to one another
  nice hat    nice    90s preteen core     your pants are too short    no thanks    lose scarf    what is the purpose of this outfit the transition from the gym lockeroom to the car    good boots    best fit
  hmm were married now
  hat doesnt seem to match with rest of it would like to see more details of top cant tell if cool or yesstyle    dope rhodesia core but would like to see it on you    if you buy me a ring sure
this thread is already far better than the last waywt          best so far also on id on sandals 
going out to eat some panera
  do you even have calf muscles
  i wear the same two hats with everything since i just havent been cutting my hair the jackets this piece of shit harrington    nice scar and rhodie bikini    teva alp premier are similar 60 bucks    where the fuck are your calves actually ive got chink farmer stock monster calves
  nah they stole my shit
  my calves are gone as shown in the picture
be rough
  very basic
terrorcore huh
  im not going to not try not sound upset but you do realize theres no need to dress up every day
  then why post lol
    but you dress like a frumpy slav whats interesting about what youre wearing what are you trying to show off what ideas or information do you want to project about yourself with your clothing
  wear the shoes on the bottom right the pink slippers your fit would be one bracket higher than college freshman tier itll show trying to ascend
  how pretentious
  its literally a waywt thread not post your most deep and thoughtout fit possible
  bump
  cringe
    regardless of whether you think its pretentious or 2deep4u or whatever the fact of the matter is those are subconscious questions everyone is asking when theyre looking at you its how visual communication works original anon told us to be rough he posted his fit in a thread to be rated im offering feedback that might be helpful but i guess be rough has a different definition to people whose ego is their most precious asset
  honestly id like it better if the jeans were slimmer im digging the top though
  ive always wondered to myself if you have an ugly face or not
  in this world is the destiny of mankind controlled by some transcendental entity or law is it like the hand of god hovering above at least it is true that man has no control even over his own will
  this is pretty good is everything slp w2c belt and shirt
  i kinda get what your coming from anon but realistically if you word out your sentences like someones fucking therapist then youre gonna look like a massive meme you couldve done anything like  pointing out a subjective flaw  comparing him to something else  giving advice to improve the outfit based on a standard  give a shitty/numerical rating  lol dont question someone into a corner over a fit even if he does look like a street fuccboitrash version of cole sprouse
  how is this nsfw
    awwww i really like the sweater its yves saint laurent vintage

how do all these people who arent holding their phones have pictures of them
  i choose to believe its all self timers and not that they have friends who share their interest and are willing to take pics of them to cope with my loneliness

  once again thirsty /fa/ ass kisses the grill ok youre cute but your fit from what i can see is nothing impressive     besides which all femanons on here dress in the same way with a schoolgirl skirt and pose the same way with the foot lifted up on the counter is there a correlation to having hole and not owning a full length mirror or knowing how to use a timer     generic /fa/ girl/10 but i hope at least school was aight
      two threads at the same time  oh boy 
havent posted in a while      dont smoke it causes cancer my mom died of lung cancer thats not cool my dude    your face looks horrible and clashes with the rest of your fit take that as you will    pants should be way way baggier those are practically skinny jeans    laurent paris    lose weight your looking a little puffy    your fits are honestly awful please get off this board its kind of sad you get praise here kinda shows how gone to shit this board is and why i stopped posting here lurk more    fashion is meant for skinny people none of this looks good on you lurk more    this is actually a really cool fit i like the colors your pretty cute as well do you have an insta mine is pimpdaddysadness    stop wearing flowers you look like a girl and bombers have been out of fashion since 2014    hot pippy longstockings/10
  super cute bf material bb
  im not feeling this one desu something about the camo and mid wash denim pushes it past irony into something approaching redneckcore      solid      the coat is fine but it looks silly with the rolled up jeans and sneakers       love it       different shoes and thisd be alright      ty my dude mirin those drips something fierce      nice      not modeltier by any stretch but i look alright being skinny helps with the facial aesthetics desu      guidi 788z      idk if this is you or not but i really like the colour palette
    dont wear your pyjama pants as clothes
daily reminder to not rate fits that dont rate others    matrixcore but seriously it looks cool bit iffy on the boots though    digging the hair and nice fit    not much to say since i cant see the shoes the sweater fits nice so theres that nice buzz cut  cant see too much from the silhouette but id say change the shoes    stop smoking and not a fan of the pants and shoes
  oh yeahhhhhh
  awful as always
this party sucks
bump
  
  oh sick dude you look just like every single male on college campuses across the us you must be so into fashion
  wonderful pants complete memecore shoes and even bigger meme jacket     can we please please stop with the rose embroidered clothing now like how are you people wearing this seriously

  wonder which of the reddit malefashion faggots u are shep must have really triggered the shit out of you that you started impersonating him
  ew
hey guys its not really helpful to comment without pointing out how something can be improved or something specific that was done well/not well i know i know i like to call people ugly fat faggots as much as the next anon but so many people in this thread are just like you look awful well do you want them to continue looking awful or do you want to make the world a nicerlooking place in general and give them some fucking advice thanks for your pointless lack of contribution to the world as usual you useless loser same goes for the thirsty fucks who are just like owo cute pls be in london or whatever whats the point in having a thread for this sort of thing anyway if not for critique and discussion this is why /fa/ as a collective has failed at fashion since its inception and will continue to do so into eternity you narcissistic faggots are more interested in parading your unfounded nescient opinions than actual fashion
  congrats on your first day here

what can i do with this leather jacket   also leather thread general
tfw you still want alden indy boots but they are veblen as fuck and raise their prices well above inflation every year
  iktf anon  i bought a pair  i could no longer take that feel
  i want some indys so bad but hate chromexcel leather
i dont understand them its a boot with a single piece toe thats got decorative stitching to make it look like a mocc toe odd
  worn in all the indiana jones movies
  theyre called the indy boot because its the boot indiana jones wore in every single movie   harrison ford specifically chose to wear them despite the costume department wanting him to wear red wings because the aldens are what he wore as a carpenter before he made it as an actor     for a boy that grew up watching indiana jones literally every single day theyre a pretty cool thing to own not to mention alden is known for making good stuff
  just bite the bullet its not like they wont last years or go out of style      they come in other leathers
    indiana jones  i know that doesnt change the fact that its a mock mocc toe
  thats always been its thing its not pretending to be anything different
  mfw people in almost 2019 are still ready to pay top dollar for ugly brown boots
  yeah dont spend 667 on alden indy boots jesus they raised their prices so much
  where are you seeing them for 600 are you from canada theyve been like 500 for the past few years
  why so get them in shell cordovan instead
  t doc martens wearing basedboy cuck
  most overrated boots out there imo way overpriced and they crease quickly and look like shit
what /fa/ thinks of wearing shoes without socks
  what are those pants called are they formal worn casually or casual pants
teenagers do this in winter which is gringe as fuck     only summer and with shorts
looks fucking stupid plus it sweats up your shoes    no show socks are okay when its really hot and youre wearing shorts the rest of the year just wear socks you absolute pillock
  looks like mid rise suit trousers
  i still think its weird and a little disgusting  the point of socks is to soak up the feet sweat so that the shoes insole doesnt if the insoles of your shoes has too much moisture youll end up with problems ex shoes making that skwetchy noise when you walk or foul odor
  its cringe looks tryhard and uncomfortable because it is
only for boat shoes in the summer
people who wear shoes without socks are just retards who arent aware no show socks exist
  only acceptable in 1960s italian summer
just use actual no show socks not ankle ones that still show a little also if your shoes are good quality leather specifically inserted into certain brands your feet wont sweat unless theres something wrong with you the only odor that you will get is the used leather patiné smell which is as /fa/ as style gets
  during teenage years in the hardcore music scene all of us did this idk why desu i think some faggot singer did it so we just all started doing it and it took off but now i wear socks
  no show socks are retardedwear socks or dont if your feet get snelling like ass just kill yourself
people who dont wear socks in any season other than summer are just as retarded as the teenagers wearing beanies in the summer
where 2 cop octagon glasses  i saw a girl wearing them the other night and decided i want some even fagtano wearing them now
      10 bones what a steal
  can you really just walk into a store with any frame and tell them to put in your prescription
  no

  found it scavenging around on google in japanese good call anon seems to be from japanese brand beautybeast or ビューティビースト
looks like some shit youd see that toopoor thot wearing
could i get an honest 1 to 10 rating on my fit thanks
  slim fit
the fact reddit reposts and saint laurent paris make up the bulk of new threads proves that fashion is kinda dead at the moment
  its way too saturated and everyone wants to participate went mainstream the same time hiphop/rap hit the mainstream a few years ago and they face the same problems
slim fit  watch the bling  saint laurent paris
  the background is nice i wish i had photoset in similar place but unable to do something like this    anywhere in my country
  it actually proves that one guy needs to find a new hobby
solid 3
  nothing wrong with that larger talent pool means better fits new shit
i like it 75
  looks good 8/10
  8/10   not my style but it looks good on you and fits very well together   i like your hair btw what is your routine
    slim fit no longer fa or what
  better than average but nothing mind blowing  just above average like a 6  above that i start comparing to professional styled fits and this fails in comparison
ugly   brown  boots
imagine actually wearing cowboy boots and living in a city
  cowboy boots are utterly based and we hate them because we hate the fact we cant wear them freely without worrying about other people judging us so we mock them to make ourselves feel better and convince ourselves they arent fucking amazing if it was socially acceptable everyone would be wearing them whenever they could and being cowboy as shit
  yikes
  as long as you dont wear them on the outside of your pants whos even gonna know or care lmao you just sound really insecure
my roommate unironically listens to this guy as if hes a god at least twice a day i will hear this fuckers voice blasting from his iphone in my kitchen right before he walks out the door in his black jeans tan chelsea boots and ill fitting green bomber    what can i do to save him or is it too late
does he get pussy
    he has a gf but its long distance    so no
fake black pr    the cringy little faggot is shitting on himself just to get the attention
introduce him to brands you like to give his inspo beyond minimalism
      im not alpha m my dude    this is something that literally happens to me everyday and i just want to help someone out
  easy lie and say something like aw yeah man ive been watching him a bit more and now i love him too then proceed to match his outfit every single day
    comedic gold thanks for the hearty laugh also tell him to watch jeremy fragrance
i have a question why does this board hate him so much he has a pretty large and loyal positive fan base and actually seems to change many young mens lives granted after a while the stuff he says becomes repetitive but he doesnt seem like a bad guy so whats with the hate im genuinely curious
  inb4 thanks to my sponsor dollar shave club
  hes a manlet
    because has an overgroomed beta bitch never worked in his life never go into a fight puts women on pedestals a real urban fag    people like him giving advice on being a man is like having a prostitute teach selfdefense to rape victims
  i just dont watch him desu
  just the name of his channel makes me sick and his content is in the same vain and basically all just advertising its literally just all advertising in disguise instead of advertising interspersed like other creators    heres 10 reasons why being a manlet is the best  now that ive allowed you to admit that youre a little guy you should check out this company that makes clothes for little people  next episode 10 reasons why size doesnt matter sponsored by puny peckers
  tfw were the same height  this is how i look next to people  just why
  tbh at least your friend isnt a hypebeast
    do you even know where you are    hur dur hasnt got in a fight
antonio is better
  guaranteed your roommate looks better than you and 99 of /fa/utists
he sold his soul to the mvmt overlords    
  hes just as bad honestly
  unironically toxic masculinity he is a literal himbo
  any type of clothing he shills is based upon classically masculine styles of dress which aim to be as inoffensive and bland as possible there is no creativity or challenge and the entirety of what he is selling can be summarized in one sentence buy plain flexible clothes with conservative time true silhouettes and fabrics that fit well
  theyre jealous of how swole he is
  dont compensate by lifting    become a trap and preferably start hrt
  i want to be a man
  51 here just give up sister real men are atleast 180 cm
  just give up sister  i refuse id kill myself before i became trans
  his style advice is useless for 99 of young men its great if you want to fit in with college republican or pua incel weirdos imo     if you are in a college town or a trendy urban area everyone worth talking to dresses like a hypebeast or an artfag if youre in a fraternity you copy your style based on your brothers     if you work in a highpowered law or finance job youre wearing a suit anyway theres far better menswear writers to check out     if you live in the burbs or trump country youre going to look out of place dressed like him 99 of the time including at work since everyone else is a schlub in various states of looking like shit badly fitting polyester dress shirts or performance polos with bad khakis and steve madden dress sneakers in business casual office settings walmart jeans and ratty tshirts everywhere else
  you act as if killing yourself is not a part of being trans
  checkmate
  why is that kid so obsessed with rolex watches fucking geek
  the patrician choice is raphael
  he just looks that way because hes a manlet hes a slave to the supplement jew never eats enough and prefers machines to free weights
  why do you care if he listens to this guy hes not exactly damaging people with giving them advice some guys need help like that so what
who is this guy and why does it he look like an elf
    get the fuck out of here with that r9k reiko trap harem shit degenerate faggots
short men are pathetic
  based     because his channel is pure basically sponsored buzzfeed articles designed to mass influence young and desperate guys in a type of cookie cutter male not encouraging them to get their own style or experiment with different concepts
  tfw im an inch taller than him    hhaha what a fuckin manlet lmao
  jeremy is based though
    he doesnt hes asian
does anyone watch ashley weston i think she gives good fashion advice

    zero suit is the fucking laziest cosplay  embarrassing
  you have to know who grimes is and what her aesthetics are before criticizing her retard  also why are you replying to that post with the braphogs too
  grimes is a generic alt art hoe retard and her music is bland and uninspired for teenage girls in public highschool only waifufags defend her
mai waifu
  looks like you only listened to art angels  or youre just being influenced by the edgy contrarian mass that hate her because of her popularity
              my heart 
  based

  her self harm scars are pretty aesthetic
  wed be perfect together _
  idk what im talking about but ill call you pleb to feel like one of the cool /mu/tants

  seems as though i may have hit a nerve
  not that anon but /mu/ fucking loves grimes what are you talking about
    shes alright anon  good times
  i hit a nerve by calling you pleb  guess its a waste of time answering to a kid that has no arguments to back up his statements      shes both loved and hated there
  not wanting to dominate a small gf

  hapahalfpure whitepure asian mix  stupid nigger
  thats literally what central asians are a mix between euros and east asians as would make sense
  come on why is this here
  hundreds of years of muttery is not the same as mixing a 100 asian with a 100 non asian to make a child thats a perfect 50/50 the definition of hapa
  squidward nose but otherwise good taste i like the natural look
what are some clothing brands for skinny tall guys im 64 and lanky as fuck so whenever i buy shirts/coats medium fits nice but the length comes up to my waist and large is the right length but looks baggy and stupid
bumping because i sympathize with this poor fucker
medium tall
  same but 63
  how the fuck are you wearing medium shirts at 64    those are for guys that are like 57 max    get a large or xl you fucking fruitcake faggot
  ahahaha fat cunt
  try /fit/
  im 61 and wear small
6ft5 here shopping is a nightmare asos has a tall section but its mostly garbage
  trying to act like a masculine alpha male on a fashion board  go back to /pol/ you fucking weirdo
  this  also  dress formal casual suits button down tops long pants nice dress boots if in doubt dress up not down
saint laurent paris
dress only in slp
  im 64 and used to be skinny and lanky as fuck    i started eating like a fucking t rex and lifting weights now im pretty fit and suddenly all those large clothes fit me nicely and actually need to go xl with some of them    my advice is to do the same having been in your exact situation but if you are comfortable with your image and its just a fashion problem then go for the long baggy stuff it definitely looks less stupid than wearing something that fits better but is short also slim/skinny fit is your ally
last thread was old here you go /fa/ggots
  can i see it from the back
w i g g a
    its been ages since ive last gone on /fa/ but is 220 now qualified as a dead thread      also first time wearing chelseas in about 1 yr still not sure if a meme or not  orange jacket was yesterdays fit hehe    warning not to bright irl warning

  s l i m f i t jeans  first fit is otherwise decent tho orange coat looks feminine      youve ruined yourself with tattoos so everything beyond that is a footnote with that said nice fit  nice grooming only flaw is necklace      just wear normal clothing ffs jesus also superheroes are for reddit manchildren      you look like a trap i like it shoes are a bit much but good fit      piercing looks terrible hair looks kind of gay pants a little too tight but not embarrassing or anything decent      you look like a character in a gambling anime great fit your hair looks like a splitend clusterfuck tho consider nopoo or conditioner only      it takes taste to pull of this many unusual pieces well done       your accessories are gayer than a dick in the ass but you look good otherwise      sweater is maybe a touch feminine but its not embarrassing or anything it would help if you had a muscley chadtier chest
  get the fuck out of this board
  id on boots
  stop posting different rs streamers u fag
    i love seeing what you guys post every day nice to have some consistently good people in these threads
i forgot to take a standing pic       the boots are really cool    your stuff is always good    wb
dont say anything about the hip jut    i am ugly unfortunately    these boots are pretty big also pretty long      thenk
im disgusted by the egotistical fags that repost trash in waywt for attention wtf is wrong with this board where 200 replies is old
  3      eytys nikita      if ur a good boy
    bro you work for likelihood
  make sense they gave you those eytys boots

what is the most i should reply to in one post    fuckin a    ehh its ok    left is wayyy better    id probably dislike you if i saw you irl i think its the glasses  the beard  the tats sorry frend very good fit on the tshirt tho    no nigga take a better pic    very nice i like the way the shirt falls on your skinny ass frame the pants are perfect and the boots really complete the look    this one isnt bad i actually like it    full pic nigga but holy shit that jacket is perfect who made it    exploring new horizons i see very nice    goddamn your fits are always amazing    me    based skelly    based kraut    ohmangahdamn good job not dyingyet    looks damn good    look at that fucking hip jut    good    shitty pic but one of my favs of the thread that zipper in particular is a very nice detail    the red doesnt fit here imo also is that coat yellow also bad pic    its ok
other thread didnt get replies    i know the sleeves are too long
  outfit is whatever doesnt look awful or anything and i like the waistline    but what i am concerned about is the bleached parts of your hair look totally fried please chop it and start fresh  dont fall for the stacey dualtoned hair again anon 
  i fucking know right i wish i didnt bleach my hair fucking dumb
  wear a belt fit looks better without jacket
  thats actually damn good advice
  this is clairo right 
  this looks frumpy because youve got the business casual shirt  skirt but the hair and striped jacket are def casual    scrap this outfit and deep condition those blonde roots until your hair grows enough to cut them
  thanks anon for the good advice     unfortunately none of the deep conditioners worked i leave them on for 30min and its still like this sigh    will just wait it out
  you need to use a protein conditioner something with keratin in it not keratin treatment just regular protein conditioner dont leave it in longer than 510 minutes and use it once a week

  i think you just saved my life

  what i get for phoneposting
  nigger/10
my girlfriend took this picture of me 3      i dont like the cuff to much    i dont like the watch decent though     very good     pretty nice loove the top of your outfit    really really good    fine    your hips look strange    very good    seems well executed    pretty good    cant really see the silhouette at all     i think its cute one hair colour is enough though    fine
  fucking hell i hate utility vests so much without it though it looks like youre going to church
  you look like a 100 thot
  most of the time same    thanks mr racism    basedbraphog/10
  thats the point fucking idiot why are you on this board
  how what the fuck   why would a thot even wear this can you just rate the outfit like a normal person something isnt right in your head
  its a member of the robot hive mind its definition of thot is very broad
  what does it even mean though   it just doesnt make sense to go out of your way to say something like that what does it gain
  najs
  the outfit looks like some trashy shit girls would wear in a shitty music video    1/10
  3/10  low effort outfit boring and uninspired ill give you points for managing to put something on  i garnered many dirty looks from females mainly  because your outfit is shit it makes them disgusted to see an outfit so uncoordinated in their field of vision
goal im a transgirl who still doesnt normally pass very well i think so i really wanted to look as femme as possible and live that dressed to the nines princess fantasy ive always wanted    the dress was picked up in a bridal salon and altered to bit me better and have the sleeves attached i love gowns with sleeves the shoes are clarks ballet flats this was my first time drinking and i decided i should not mix that with my first time wearing heels
  hahahahahahaha i saw that atrocity on femalefashionadvice lmao
  pants are too baggy its really bringing you down homey
  lol that orangesuited fedora warrior in the back
  shirt is too short my friend
  lol shit advice
  dude thats a fucking mounty standard canadian military dress
  is it really hmmm truth hurts sometimes
  first time ive heard that lol i might get them tailored but they have to be a little baggier to fit the cowboy boots shafts so itll be just in the thigh where are they too baggy exactly
  yea he should have had a red jacket and black trousers to complete that look
  why are you wearing cowboy boots
losers
  adorable dress but it doesnt work the best with your posture legs and hair if you want to wear elegance you need to be elegant
  because i have no calves and i want to even out my leg proportions and they look better than chelseas or sidezips imo
  why are you responding to this unironically
  how do these people go out and not feel ashamed
  hes a thirsty brainlet but that is somewhat redundant its incredible the bait i see people fall for
  shit shoes faggot muh designer laces and square toes but the rest looks awesome
cant beat this
s l i m fit today    very cool but having a belt would have been nice     actually like the vest but not with rest of fit clashes with the white button up and everything really    blazer is ugly and doesnt work with rest of fit also need to see shoes to judge fully    theres nothing wrong with it but its pretty boring and basic
  not feeling the jacket but who nose maybe im the only one
slim fit
  so do people buy straight leg jeans because they have wide hips that looks weird in slim fit
  regularstraightslim  but everyone looks weird in slim fit even if you have chopstick legs slim fit makes you look like a mfa soiboi
  no slimfit looks good on tall guys with normal hips i thought it was fatties that shunned the slim fit but the wide hip normies also look bad in them aesthetically theres no argument like the best slim fit model looks better the best straight or regular fit
how do i achieve maximum b l o a t
no fewer than 12 scoops

what are some fashionable names first middle last
  chad thunder cock

  seth frederick john holland
  op that largely depends on what cultures youre talking about  western something like tyrone freeman gonzalez would be very fashionable in america for example something like mohammad allah achbar would be quite fashionable in europe it all depends on what cultures youre talking about op
  if i put that off will it die
whats a good mens style thats timeless without looking like a hipster one that you can wear when youre older than like 20 unlike techcore lunarcore or shit like that
  if you are a soiboiwormwear americana  if you are alpha prep british country riviera etc
  lunarcore is p good
  kek i ment workwear of course
  i dont have a name for this style something like creative adult core
how about you look at what contenporary men are wearing today identify pieces and styles that you like and blend them together in a way that pleases you instead of asking others to do all of that for you
  why cant people wear these boots like normal human beings everything about this pisses me off from the ridiculous cuffs to the absurd fashion lacing he literally had to go out and buy a separate pair of extra long laces just to do that even though it serves no purpose and looks retarded
  1 these superior high quality authentic raw selvedge jeans are made to one length  2 they wrap the laces around the back instead of lacing up the top two rows of eyelets which makes them easer to take on and off  3 nothing wrong with me
i have developed my own style i call it well fitting basics core   what you do is simple you get rid of weird streetwear stuff and graphic junk and start wearing normal basic pieces that fit well and whos colors match top it off with something like adidas sambas and you have a look you can rock from age 20 all the way to 60
  imagine being mad over this
core  can wear  how is this the fashion board again
  there is nothing wrong with asking people to share images of contemporary 25 year old men wearing fashionable clothes on a fashion and clothing imageboard
the thing is there is no definitive timeless style not anymore    fashion was either defined by strong traditions or strong trends and both are gone
  youre retarded most boots have laces like that there is nothing wrong with wrapping them around like that
  hack core
  im mad that other people have their own taste and style  i cant believe people actually take extra steps to look good  everything should be basic and utilitarian    imagine being this childish and dead inside
  you can fuck your tendons if you tie it too tight or if you trip and your ankle has to flex but there is now a tight solid band restricing its expansion     wear your boots like that if you want theyre your ankles but there is a reason not to
  based  art museum curator core
  literally all military boots have super extras long laces like that meant to be wrapped around the ankle   when i was a soldier i wore my boots like that for 4 years
  fashion lacing  are you actually on the spectrum
  personally i think a good option is hiker core  like get some danner hiking boots and maybe a patagonoa fleece or arcteryx jacket
  timeless
  tracksuits
    lol just dress like ryan gosling
  what are some examples of these for reference
  check your closet for an example of the soi
  funny because the place i was told not to wear them like that was the in military we always tucked
  sleazecore only looks better the older you get
  full veilance only bicthes
  visibly autistic
  i get you man
  tnf  epitome of no effort british normiecore
  full rick
  the epitome of no effort entirety of westeurope normie core    middle aged need coat dont really understand fashion or care   the north face
  kind of this       is ok starting point    but basically buy shit from oi polloi and kafkacouk not too loose fold pant legs comfy knits looser fitting shirts patagonia big parkas etc
  i mean relatively timeless something that wont go out of style in like a couple years or less
  literally just minimalist menswear
  rick suits would definitely work cropped tailored astaires could be thrown in but definitely dont wear dunks/geos/ramones/any sneakers stick to boots and derbies

  as a former medic in the army i can tell you i didnt treat one single patient for any ankle related problems from tying laces like that
  pretty good
  milsurp  also looks good on women
  nobody except a retard would pay full retail for any of that when it constantly goes on sale for 50 off or even more
  id on turtleneck ive been trying to find one that buttons
  classic /mosleycore/
  that guy on the left looks pretty gud
  unironicly i think mosely is /fa/ as fuck i think black turtlenecks look fucking nice
just do a don draper without the tie
  tfw you buy moc toes to be like steve and everyone calls you onions
  no moc toes there friend 
  he wore them when he raced motorcycles
  the truth is what you wear has little to do with how chad you look  facial aesthetics and body type are far far more important
  good pic m8 i unironically think that past the age of 25 the easiest way to look good is to basically cosplay as steve mcqueen snuff chukkas sport watches fitted khakis and nice sweaters/sweatshirts
    ill politely disagreei think blue jeans and a black or white shirt is pretty timelessit will never go out of fashion as casual mens wearjust make sure it fits properly
  100 this 
  no chad will ever wear techwear or any autismcore fit
  but you see fine sir without slavery who will pick the cotton    just because you cant imagine a world without your shitty fashion taste doesnt mean that that world isnt coming
  except denim has been a thing for a good century and a half  i dont know what kind of gay ass pants you think will completely substitute denim but i dont see that happening any time soon
  except denim has been a thing for a good century and a half  and the african slave trade existed in the western world for over 400 years  but i dont see that happening any time soon  thats because youre a small minded individual

i wear workwear/americana/milspo/partisancore shit but im 64 weigh 215 and workout every other day have i differentiated myself enough from the subhuman basedboy to be able to pull this off i have an unnatural hate for these degenerates and i wanna keep wearing this type of stuff bc i think i look good in it but i do not want to be associated with these people
  soyb0y was changed to basedboy for some reason
just wear apc like an adult
  funny how everyone is shitting on you when you are right  wearing boots like that just makes you look like a fucking hipster
  maybe varies by region but this is standard npc microsoft core in the pacific northwest absolute cringe but great if you want to blend in
if you have the body to pull it off
  looking like a soiboy has more to do with being skinnyfat and having a gay undercut than workwear
  w2c highwaisted trousers like these
  i went full hitler youth with my undercut would that put me in the onions region im also lowkey skinnyfat honestly its barely noticeable  its bc of deadlifts  i dont look like a onions thou facially
  i wrote onions not onions fuck u censors
  if you have an undercut dress more modern/urban full heritage workwear will look soi
wearing casual normal clothes that fit you well and are color coordinated in understated ways
  i lean more toward the partisancore side desu but i do wear some workwear stuff eh oh well if any calls me a onions im gonna end them
  fucking onions dd
  the pants are that much usually vsvm denim is around 400 so like 550600

i am workig to define an aesthetic for myself that i dubbed rugged casual it takes smart casual as a foundation collared shirts jumpers leather boots but replaces overly dressy elements with rugged ones leather jacket instead of blazers black faded jeans instead of chinos/trousers     worked very well in summer and spring but now that its to cold for leather jackets and i need warmer boots im having trouble to adjust

previous thread     bbc perfume documentary part 1 of 3      w2c bottles  usacanada          use google to obtain the maximum discount code at fragrancenet 37    europe    see directory at bottom for your country    general info        various fragrance communities/review sites/blogs                w2c samples              on diy fragrances  
im getting my fragrance collection started i have already picked up narciso rodrigues bleu noir as a daily driver that is inoffensive and can be used in a professional setting    now i want something that is appropriate for going out in the wintertime romantic dates visiting christmas market with friends going to concerts classical music that kind of stuff    im looking at dior homme intense and chanel antaeus i can get both for almost exactly the same price i have tried and liked both which one should i get in your opinion
  if you want to smell like burt reynolds go with antaeus
to the anon who just bought tdh vi how much did you pay for it on ebay
  overused but still
  75 delivered  well see how it be like soon enough
  popular doesnt mean bad youre right though 2 out of every 3 times that i notice some other dudes fragrance its dior sauvage
  of those two definitely dhi more modern and imo more likeable even if it is a bit of an acquired taste in and of itself
dont use deoderant  nigga i cant wear cologne on my armpits    if people hate axe or whatever so much what should i put on my armpits then
  unscented deodorant such as schmidts or crystal plus the fragrance of your choice please be sure you wash thoroughly and have zero trace of stink before applying either deo and fragrance to your pits also axe spray isnt usually deodorant anyway its usually just cheap fragrance though there are a few varieties that include antiperspirant axe dry
  nonscented or lightlyscented deodorant is a thing my nigga for nonscented options those crystal deodorant sticks mentioned by  are quite popular dove also makes a nonscented 48hr dry spray antiperspirant that i like its marketed to women but its nonscented so it doenst make a difference for a lightly scented option and my personal favourite jack black makes a high quality deodorant/antiperspirant that smells great but the smell doesnt project and wont clash with your cologne
should i toss my armani acqua di gio in the trash    what should i wear for a beach/seaside/nautical vibe
  in my city guys barely wear frags at all and if they do it is one million or boss bottled so sauvage is still unknown and gets you a lot of compliments eventhough it is a meme here lol
so im not crazy month blanc legend night is completely superior to the regular right
  its amazing
paid retail price for a frag at ulta because the lady helping me was cute asf and she told me itsmells good on me  knowingly i could get the same frag for literally half the price online  i fell for their jewish tricks bros hold me
i have no clue when it comes to fragrances is adg profumo a scent to wear everyday
  if you smoke quit    fuck you buddy i started smoking cloves and got a couple of compliments on the smell
  spray onto cards  fucking dumb the medium its applied makes a huge difference for fragrance cards will never give you a wholly accurate picture investigate a few this way maybe sure but each time you come in spray a different frag on each wrist so you can figure out how it smells on your skin which is unique from others so 2 each visit
its possible to wear this in the current times and dont smell like a boomer    i have half a bottle every time i try to wear it feels like a punch in the face from your dad
  voyage
  its the best mont blanc frag better than the overrated individuel supremely underrated
  worked
  kys
  guys anyone
god tier fragrance and also cheap
  you can wear any fragrance you want every day
    hows the performance of night though mont blanc is notorious for having poor performance frags
  not really some fragrances are way too heavy for everyday use
  supporting local economy instead of buying from big corporate warehouse in desert  feels bad and tricked  lmao      yes be an alpha male somehow with fit body and have a job require wearing suit everyday      should be fine
  if ypu dress even remotely similar to any of those 4 faggots you should wear dylan blue not those
  i live in a rural town 2 hours away from the big city and the only frags i smell on guys are typical clubbing scents like eros 1 million and the like but whenever i head to the big city i always smell sauvage
whats the most cost efficient way of getting frags i want to save up to get a couple for boxing day do they do any real discounts like 10 off online or in stores anywhere online whens the best time to buy it and where do you check for price updates on certain frags
is there anything else quite like baccarat rouge 540
  read the op
  ive only tested in store but it doesnt seem to project much or last very long i only did 1 spray on my wrist and its very subtle after the first hour although i did still detect it 45 hours later    honestly still seems worth it it smells so good
  is fragrencenet really the cheapest option available how do they manage such steep discounts
  i know they have some damn cheap creeds but im worried im gonna get some stale old shit or something
  i agree its extremely pleasant but the preformance seems to be lacking if this shit lasted itd easily bet top 5 in terms of scent alone its so fucking good
what stores do australian posters use chemist warehouse feelingsexy fragrancenet and the other internationals
what fragrance does pic related wear
  mybeautyspot if youre in victoria
  yes unless you want to bid on a no reserve auction on ebay or lowball somebody on the basenotes for sale subforum they manage the discounts because they buy off retailers who want to clear their shelves to make room for new stock    no such thing fragrances from the 1930s still hold up were talking about oils suspended in alcohol inside a more or less airtight glass and from the 1990s on most of these ingredients are synthetic    roja enigma
  fuck me i was just in melbourne wont be there again until feb
  they do deliver as far as i know theyre priced the same as chemist warehouse but have more frags in their selection such as guerlains stuff which cw doesnt have
  i dont always wear perfume but when i do i prefer dylan blue
  i first smelled it two days ago along with other hyped frags like silver mountain water black afgano patchouli imperial cedrat boise etc etc and br540 is the most memorable scent of them all    i love the burnt sugary smell dancing with the super salty musky ambergris     come to think of it the ambergris in br540 reminds me of the same potent ambergris used in aventus once upon a time     im def copping a full bottle i cant imagine what the rest of the mfk line smells like will have to order samples
  priceritemart has large discounts all the time
  paco rabanne pour homme
  ulta is not local
the top of the atomizer the part you press just randomly came off my bottle of mip i dont even use it i just take the cap off once in a while to sniff it and i noticed one day the top was loose and it just fell off is there a way to reattach it
guys    
  guys i tell you with this fragrance will be so powerful and will get the most intense ladies reactions fragrance army has made my journey what is is and you all have so much strength and power just 5 minutes ago i see my brothers new child and it is happening so much for my family and my friends and all of fragrance army we have master perfumer on this and this fragrance is the best fresh mens fragrance on the market i test every small variation so i make sure this is perfect guys the strength is just so much you guys and when this fragrance sell so much i buy new ferrari because it is the best of the best just like this fragrance and just like fragrance army guys when you smell this you are just gonna be like wow trust me guys i just want to make this video because it is happening so intensely and we will keep making videos like we always do peace guys
  he got alberto morillas as his perfumer holy shit dudes made some of my favorite scents
  push it back on
    jeremy is unironically based even in his negative opinions hes likeable and would be a fun person to hang out with
      will you blind buy fragrance army
  couldnt have happened to a better guy i hope him all the success fuck the youtube fragcomm for trying to shit on him every step of the way heart power worldwide
            anyone have links on the youtube drama involving jeremy ive heard stuff about plagiarism and harassment stuff but havent really looked into it
why are there so few genuine fragrance enthusiasts here    it seems like the most genuine posters are retarded teenagers trying to figure out what cologne is gonna make their crush like them
  niche interest on a relatively niche board never gonna attract loads of people is it
  we keep quiet because theres not much to say in the end i have amouage serge lutens parfums mdci and tauer in my collection but 75 of my participation in /frag/ is recommending wonderwood to the nth noob looking for a wood perfume
  any experience with lyric by amouage
  lyric man or just lyric no experience but the note list looks good and from what i have tried over the years amouage is reliable not every frag is a knock out of the park but even their more generic ones are well composed
just how much does a cigarette habit ruin your sense of smell
  theres this old lady im friends with who smokes a lot and she knows im into fragrances so we talk about that a lot and when she tries to sniff dior sauvage off me she had to lean very close and almost touch my skin to smell it might be due to age though but i sure as hell cant smell her fragrance when she just finished smoking
  shit im only 22 and in the same boat as her feels bad man
  sense of smell fades a lot with age its why old womens perfume is so strong they dont have any idea how strong it is and whos going to tell an old lady she smells
  everyone here personally sampled most obsessive 1960s women perfumes through 2010s obscure paris exclusive niche firm scents     but they tell you sauvage is the best all just to troll you
  thats because sauvage is redpilled
  i unironically love sauvage
  10/10 will preorder    we will need an objecgive reviewer to review this scent though we cant take jeremys word on this one since its his scent also half of the fragcom hates his ass
  hes going to have a video with women sniffing it anyways
  hes doing himself a disservice not selling samples of it though people would be tempted to get samples just because its jeremy
  thats a decanting opportunity for us
  actually speaking of does anyone know how expensive it is going to be
  i believe he said it was going to be a niche fragrance so expect 200 dollars
  ive done alot for this    what do you think he meant by that
  donkeybrain
  your posting a picture of a boot pushing a jew in an oven that offensive man not cool at all
  the jews is ready in thick german accent    what did he mean by this
  yeah never understood the hate
  the jews is not good enough
  you know what he meant anon you know exactly what he meant    he got to sample morillas secretions magnifiques
        age
  i tried pressing it back on but it doesnt stay on 
  26 i own roughly 30 frags i dont go to it as much as when i first got it but its not bad by any means
what would be a step up from davidoffs cool water  preferably something similar but for winter  im looking at frantica and it has versace as something similar and i know i like it    looking for some recs so i can get some samples later today
  in my opinion fresh fragrances dont really fit in fall/winter you might live in a subhuman country without seasons though
should i blind buy havana by aramis im looking for a very affordable winter fragrance and based on the notes this seems right up my alley
  i think you should blind buy everything   i think you should have to use the whole bottle and really study the notes even if you hate it
im looking for a bergamot or orange based frag i can use when it gets cold also  im not sure i like the sound of tdh since it seems a bit earthy to me  is there anything else worth trying out
  i was afraid you would say that it looks like the atomizer is supposed to screw down into the sprayer try screwing it in if it still wont stay try a very small dab of glue on what looks like the threads on the atomizer hope this helps
  fragrancearmy united youre the man jeremy cant wait to experience your journey with you
  how present is the tobacco note its one of my favorite scents
does anybody here have a clue when mdci is releasing their new collection      thanks
  i expect it to be sauvage with an aventus dry down     i dont know if ill want to wear it but there is no chance he puts out something thats not liked by 90 of the female population all the autistic reviewers will hate it regardless
    i have a feeling its gonna be a really good fragrance jeremy doesnt have bad taste and he even said that hes attempting to hit the whole demographic designer/niche with this one so i expect it to be bold but pleasing plus he got fucking alberto morillas to make his juice the guy has made some incredible scents theres a small clip in the video of him getting female reactions of his fragrance and they instantly give it a 10/10 that kinda worries me because it could also be some super generic masspleaser still hard to tell but im leaning towards it being something ill like tremendously
  do we know what its called yet
  nothing yet he had it in a small tester bottle and he was covering up the name with his thumb
  its not very present any review will tell you that but its there i own the fragrance so id know
just blind bought guerlain heritage  vetiver both as edt after reading reviews of edp vs edt i know what im expecting but what does /frag/ think of these dont see them mentioned very often
  imma guess chadtistic pour homme
  heritage is really nice and under appreciated dont be alarmed after the first spray youll want to wait a solid 30 minutes for it to settle
is eau des baux good for someone in their mid 20s or is it more mature just want to avoid any old man cologne hints
  it doesnt come off as an old man scent at all it opens with some spice incense and cypress and dries down to a slightly sweet vanilla perfect for the cooler weather
just blind bought bentley for men intense because of jerememe is it good
would it be a good idea to wear armani code year round is it cloying in the summer
  bleu de chanel edt/edp reminds me of a more classy sophisticated tdh
  smells disgusting in my opinion   at least its cheap
  i like it though it is a touch sweet also it doesnt last very long on me
what are your favourite fragrance youtubers personally i cant stand this jeremy guy but im subscribed to    brooklyn fragrance lover  redolessence  tiff benson  smelling great fragrance reviews
  the australian girl i like how she talks
taking the hook to ask where does brazilian posters get their fragrances shits expensive as fuck in sephora and i dont trust americanas sellers
  green irish tweed
  your iq is showing    get the fuck out of here
  based nikhil and peter dont watch anyone else anymore its the same shit every video
  typical basenoter in that pic they can fuck right off
  based jeremyposter never leave us if ever a month goes without a post from you i will presume /frag/ is compromised
whats the difference between creed royal oud and royal oud millesime concentration nothing no sellers specify and even have pictures of both for the same product how do i know what im getting
  no difference its the same thing theyve just stopped putting millesime on the bottle
  thanks ive watched and read reviews and some said it was hardly there while others said thats all there was
  heritage smell dated according to various reviews though luca turin tells it is one of the 1990s trend he basically says it is ryan gosling on 62 nfl quarterback body imagery    guerlain vetiver is good smell like mosquito spray very non sexy and cold
  lmao peter is the most pretentious faggot in the community if theres anybody i cant watch its him harping on and on about synthetics and yet still has the vag to cry and put out an almost hour long video about how much mean comments affect him its funny he shits on anything popular because he knows he cant pull it off by grabbing pussy peter is a symptom of nichesnobbery has everything and yet nothing has a cool job plays guitar and still you can sense that sadness in the tone of his voice because he cant get women real chads tearing clam are out there wearing axe and catching digits the whole reason for his fragrance kick was literally cause he was done dirty by a broad thats as pathetic as it gets lmao
are there any vintage perfumes that would hold up to modern fragrance tastes    what are your favorite vintage scents favorite vintage bottles
  damn dude this freudian analysis of a guy who talks about fragrances on youtube is just as pathetic
  i will try that thanks for the suggestion
  muh fragrance is only for getting pussy  muh sex is the only important thing in life    could not possibly get more npc
  freudian   no jewery involved here just the facts jack       u brainless npc hurr durr think fer urself loser lololzzzz     jesus christ you fucking virgins never know when lay off a beaten meme its done junior you autists killed it off already you nopussygettin motherfucker i prolly get more pussy than you get air nigga stay sniffing your byredo wrists in the corner while i rail your hamplanet mother doused in drugstore joop homme honkey lmao

  das rite ytboi
wow guys i just smelled baccarat rouge 540 and this is the best thing ive smelled ever
what fragrance should i get if i want something purely for myself to pick up on throughout the day but isnt noticeable by people unless they are really close to me also where and how should i spray it to achieve this prefer something cheap since i dont expect or want people to notice it
  tam dao to the neck and chest
  this looks good but a lot more expensive than what im looking for and sold out on fragrancenet are the other diptyque scents as good is comfort cologne a thing
blind buy roja enigma  y/n
  is comfort cologne a thing  yeah if youre a virgin
  i havent tried other diptyques but its definitely my comfort cologne sample it the scent is very well blended and of a high quality but stays very close to the skin you can get a bottle of the edt for 90 or so which is pretty cheap for a niche scent
  yolo nigga
  i cant wait till i can afford to blind buy roja
  yes
      parfum or edp
imagine fucking the accent right out of her    
  i havent tried them side by side but basenotes generally says the parfum is better
any frags for this aesthetic  inb4 cool water
  something cdg
  zara cedar or any cedar
  versace the dreamer
  invasion barbare is actually a good fragrance
  fahrenheit layered with cool water peak 80s fragrances
    this is a good comparison not only for the bust but vaporwave is a reinterpretation of 1980s rb drakkar noir a fougere is the quintessential 1980s cologne invasion barbare is a modern fougere par excellence
  theyre basically identical edp already gets 10 hours longevity on me personally i see no reason to go parfum
  baccarat rouge 540
  shut up anon
  anyone
  literally everyone wears this
  because its good
how to manscape so i shaved my cock hairs for the first time in ten years and i noticed razor bumps after and now we have a few ingrown hair pimples and shit i fucked up how do you get rid of cock hairs safely i have hairs about 90 of the way up my cock shaft a really hairy dick should i nair it wax it
  i wanna lick aocs feet
  you guys dont shave your cock
  weird way to say i wanna eat aocs ass but ok
  why would i im not planning on ever getting laid again
  post pic so we can see how awful your dick looks now
    yeah i feel that i had to though because i was going to a swingers club with my gf and i wanted to get laid
  i would trim and any outliers i would pluck off  just squeeze the skin and pluck    i dont see why you have to be 100 shaved  youre not a pornstar and they let someone else do it
  the only thing you should do down there is trim to a 05mm cut
  i have a lot of hairs on my cock shaft that would take a while any women here care to chime in when you hook up with a guy do you care about cock hairs my gf always says she notices them while blowing me soi shaved them so other chicks wouldnt notice does it matter
its probably better to have the bumps then have gross hairs all over personally i just take it as a side effect worth for the smoothness i get told i have 
  yeah those are ingrown hairs and are pretty natural esp the first time i usually just trim it these days and shave the hairs on my shaft make it look clean    plz send aocs ass on a platter so a nibba can eat
try shaving in the other direction next time use aftershave as well
        you fucking mungs news flash  youre a fucking mammal and have hairy fucking ding dongs however we are civil beings and thus use the dedicated ball clipers to trim our body hair  any woman that wouldnt prefer this isnt worth your time
shave in the direction your hair goes the one and only time ive ever gotten ingrown pube hairs was when i accidentally shaved upwards against the grain next few days i had ingrown hairs in that spot
  working on using an epilator on mine working bit by bit
  just trim it short with scissors you can still get them very short but it will look natural rather than the uniform length you get with a trimmer    shaved is just gay and feels gross
  trimming  shaving for both men and women imo it looks good theres never bumps or rashes and its easier
  i do i dont get why people are so scared of shaving their cock or balls if youre gentle then at worst youll get a microscopic cut and a drop of blood but nothing more
  agree but what about the balls
  use guard or scissors never use clipper without guard
set trimmer on 912mm  shave entire regio including top of thighs asstocrotch everything    set trimmer on 36mm shave pubes balls and shaft    grab a razor shave your shaft from base to top shave balls    grab trimmer and fade the shave lines     i was going to a swingers club with my gf   lol how fucking degenerate
    veet your balls and round your dick shave your bush with clippers
  i was blowing a guy once who had a hairy willy it was fucking disgusting and made me gag also it was quite uncomfortable/painful when we got to fucking  / i have no idea why some dicks are hairy when its just going to hurt the girl so yes shave it
  im pretty hairy too but it takes about 30 minutes or so just watch something on netflix  i know you have downtime
have hair on the shaft  not a lot certainly not enough to notice when getting blown  but just enough to get pulled by a condom  so has anyone tried plucking it seems time consuming and needlessly uncomfortable but using a razor on my dick makes me feel uneasy
t r i m  r  i  m
  id rather the girl stopped and told me desu i could go and take care of it quickly or have her join me in the shower and make a game of the shaving or something
  omg this dick im sucking is so disgusting i cant believe im doing this  well time to let him fuck me    the thot mindset everyone
  this is what i do shaving causes massive itchiness for me im probably never gonna try to trim my butthole hair should i how do i even go about that
  i ate out a hairy girl once and hated it but i still fucked her whats the difference
  im scared to put a scissor near my dick vein
  i cant grow a lot of facial hair so i often pluck my chin hairs with tweezers one day i decided i would see if plucking pubic hair hurts it doesnt so i plucked a few then it looked weird and i couldnt just stop half way so i kept going took 3 hours to finish but definitely looked and felt a lot smoother than shaving
  i lov her
just shave it with a normal 5 blade razor and then use salicylic acid after to exfoliate to keep razor bumps and ingrown hairs from appearing
  i wasnt intending to pluck the entirety of my pubic area itd look goofy given how my body hair is setup but ill definitely remember your post when im plucking my cock later thank you
  virginity manifest
looking at the nomos club neomatik as a gift she would like something simple with a textile band im up to spend around 5k    any recommendations for me can i do better
  took me 35 years but finally found a woman i would have kids with all she wants is a simple gold band for an engagement ring but i want to get her something else too always likes nomos but know /fa/ knows best
  there is a watch thread with watch autists just to help you but i would take something classic and gracile which doesnt work with such a watch band something with an older name maybe glashütte or something like that
  it would be a nice forum and can work if some of those virgin fags want to give a nice present to a female
  im probably going to get killed for saying this but unless your girl has explicitly expressed an interest in mechanical time pieces i wouldnt bother even my wife who like mechanical things never wears her watch because its too heavy and she hates having to keep resetting the time i would get her a quartz cartier or something like that
    this get her a classic quartz tank
  this buy a tank or a date just besides those brands like cartier or rolex she wont care about it
  any good recommendations
womens watches are usually junk because women dont actually give a fuck about them or find them interesting get her a cheap gaudy thing from macys or a bracelet if she actually cares about watches then get here a mens watch that is sized 38mm or smaller
  oh definitely im looking at mens watches shed hate anything gaudy she works on a farm just looking at 36mm mens watches simple white face textile band
    if she works on a farm get her a toolwatch that means something rugged like a rolex explorer ii reference number 16570 at 40mm its a bit large but can take a beating and isnt flashy at all especially with a black dial women seem to like the white dial more though  if all else fails you can get her a seiko skx013 and spend the rest the watch will be around 200 on some nice jewelry for her ir a nice vacation for the two of you
  thanks man you opened up a whole new avenue of research with tool watches thats her style for sure ive been wearing an oris big crown propilot for years and she always says how much she likes it really appreciate it
    no problem man if you are going to drop serious cash in a watch its worth it to look at the grey market look that term up and/or second hand the watch i recommended is discontinued and not incredibly popular yet so you can probably get a nice price its better to pay a premium at a trusted seller than buying what seems like a good deal for a little less but ends up being a rotten deal because of hidden flaws a bad seller etc etc try to avoid ebay you really need to know what youre doing buying there or on chrono24 or similar sites buying a nice watch can be overwhelming so feel free to ask questions
  which watch do you recommend that isnt incredibly popular
    the explorer ii the reference number is 16570 there is a new model but by thats 42mm so very big
what is more fa  being healthy or unhealthy
healthy lol
  sauce
  healthy skin and hair unless youre going scumwave etc and unhealthily gaunt body
unhealthily skinny with a polysubstance drug addiction  but clear skin and hair  this is the objective answer
  this
  dead
being healthy despite not acting healthy
  unhealthily skinny unironically looks like shit no matter what the retarded npcs in this thread say youd honestly be better off being slightly chubby than being grossly underweight and looking like youre in a concentration camp healthily slender like the models in the 80s before the fashion industry decided everyone needed to weigh ten pounds is probably the best look
  the anorexic look was decided to be good looking after the 80s  lmao fashionlets need to stop revealing their powerlevel
  people did it then but most models were normal thin and not scarythin like you see now at any rate it doesnt look good no matter what you say
  fat looks bad on the eyes admit it youre just coping with your bad lifestyle choices by tricking yourself into thinking your body is ideal youre delusional
  health is always /fa/ because were biologically programmed to like it being unhealthy is just for hipster edgelords who think theyre cool
  being healthy but looking unhealthy
  having a healthy diet and moderate lifestyle to offset the effects of drinking/smoking/drugs is the most /fa/
  this
  unhealthy can be effey for the few years you can pull it when youre young before it takes its toll and your body/face turns to shit thing is you can be just as effey by being healthy instead and you can actually maintain it for much much longer
  being unhealthy but in a drug addiction way
bulimic is the only way op
          this pale starving heroin autists out here looking like they bout to be naturally selected
  looking healthy but having unhealthy habits particularly smoking
  what is more fa  big danks
being healthy but having mental disorders/addiction problems
opinion on girls w colored hair
  i instantly assume they take it up the ass and have a very loose throat
theyre trouble
most likely theyre going to be weird and not in the good way the hair colour is how they tell you to stay away
i wanna cum in billie ellishs throat
would you dye your hair
  to be unique
  i bleached some streaks in my hair and i regret it i miss my natural hair so much
thots most likely have daddy issues self proclaimed feminists brag about hating men 80 chance of being insane
  why do you change haircuts
  pics blease i was thinking about doing that but im not sure now that you say it
  mostly because i get bored
i wanted to have hair like pic rel when i was like 14
      any color in specific girls w pink hair are always ugly or feminists but blue kinda black hair is more normal i think
  i think its kinda pretty when its not the whole hair and the color kinda fades with the original its nice
  no i was joking i dont give a shit about dyed or natural hair it has literally zero indication of personality    girls w pink hair are always ugly or feminists  yikes
colored hair usually means a need for attention but thats easily overlooked if i can get a blue hair gf
  for me it always gives you the feeling of an anime lover kind of girl mens are stupid because they cant handle me im also lesbian because i havent kissed a boy since middle school and have cut myself because im fat i have an underboob tattoo an ear gauge a nose piercing even tho my nose is shaped like a pig and i love cats omg  im not generalizing colored hair girls but pink hair is uh yikes
  yeah but you are generalizing  dyed hair can look either really good or completely atrocious just depends on the person    like when i see people generalize for me it always gives you the feeling of an anime lover kind of weeb faggot girls are stupid because they wont fuck me im also gay because i havent kissed a girl ever and should cut my wrists i have a stick and poke tattoo because ninth grade sucks a body pillow bad acne even though my nose isnt greasy and i love hentai omg    im not generalizing underage weeb faggots but being underage is uh yikes
  it can look really well done but unfortunately most girls who want to dye their hair unnatural colors have no taste
  but that doesnt even look good this does
  embarrassing    based she a cutie
  thank god im changing it soon
  looks fine
cute with natural/minimal makeup traditional haircuts and more subdued colors  ruined by overcontouring wings chalky skin drawn on freckles undercuts sjw bangs and neon dye
  they are crazy
  if theyre older than 25 theyre probably victims of satanic ritual sex abuse
  two of those girls on the top have obviously dyed hair but its a shade of brown not a very good one albeit i dont see the issue here
every girl ive ever met with colored hair outside of natural shades was a terrible person or in one case autistic
  must die
s tier  realistic hair color swaps  blonde on black  good tier  pink with dark roots   okay tier  blue/purple hair with pale complexion  covering up grays   shit tier  neon colors  extremely shit tier  multiple neon colors

  fuck you stoopid
red flag  basically an indicator that i wont like the person also that they dont like themselves  but i do want to have sex with them
  warning colouration to predators  do you even read
trash
  this     aposematism is a warning signal to potential predators which means if he finds it repulsive that probably says more about him than it does about us
  aposematism signals that the animal has an unsavory characteristic like being overly aggressive poisonous venomous foul smell or taste which says a lot about roasties with rainbow hair
deal breaker
  clown tier  neon red/red orange
  unfortunately this is literally the only kind of girl i think is pretty  kms

  i bet your parents still dress you too  and make sure you clean behind your ears when you shower
  unironic yikes  so this 4channel thing is taking full effect huh
  my parents have impeccable taste you fuck i step out every day looking effay thanks to them
  everyone thinks youre a cuck
  came her to post this  based and redpilled
  irl anime waifu tier superb wonderful    old school american comic book tier very cool actually interesting i bet she makes good conversation but the look itself is not for me    all women pictured here have more red flags than a chinese military parade the colored hair is only a part of that though    very cute    awful    i personally believe that something like getting your hair dyed some wild color should come after sorting out the rest of your life in other words a person should not waste time and money on unusual hair if they are fat or out of shape or poorly dressed or have poor grooming habits or have not developed a decent personality etc you can throw away an unflattering dress but if you dye your hair a color that just doesnt work for you then its a bit more complicated to fix on the other hand if a girl is just a total babe with a cute flattering haircut and not some half head shaved bowl cut gender studies nonsense then she will still look great because beautiful people are beautiful regardless of hair color
  wow you live like absolute shit  hurrr so what loser i bet you only live well cuz mummy and daddy xdd
nevertheless life is short a lot of people especially younger people might want to get their hair dyed because its exciting or different or something even if they havent sorted out the other bigger priorities in their appearance and if thats the case then at the very least they shouldnt purposefully uglify themselves as some sort of statement
dyed to other natural colour that matches ethnicity  ok sure  dyed to natural colour of other ethnicity eg asian blonde  why  dyed to radioactive colours  caveman instinct and brain thinks its a bad idea
  satan has spoken
  pls b in london
theres a great aesop rock track called racing stripes about just doing whatever with your hair youre young itll grow back    if it doesnt grow back just get over it your hair is a part of your defining characteristics but it shouldnt be your entire personality hopefully youve got some stuff about you to make you feel better about clean cuts or a shaved head because honestly no one else should give a fuck if they do theyve got bigger problems than your hairstyle
  opinion on girls w colored hair
it is painfully obvious how many insecure teenage men are on this board by now let me tell you something very simple about women with dyed hair they do not care about you or your opinion    they dont care about attention they dont care about making a statement these are thoughts which enter the mind of an insecure person a person which will never have the confidence to set themselves an aesthetic ideal and strive towards it people who need guides to dress    women who dye their hair do it for one reason only because they think its pretty insecure losers and neckbeards being repulsed or scared by them as a result is something they welcome women get a crazy amount of attention by men especially creepy ones being lusted after is the default state of young attractive women    why would they care about cutting out a large portion of men that they would feel uncomfortable around in the first place why do you think your evaluation of a womans hair factors into her decisions at all it is of absolutely no importance
  call him an incel next
  pastel hair with dark/minimalist clothes looks amazing
  coloured hair or tatoos  trash 
  i do thats why i made this thread

  most of them are nudists

  this is bait right  youre larping as a reddit user right
nothing screams iam a stupid tryhard louder than colored hair unless its blonde/brunette in which case its just boring you should not color you hair

  whatever color you were born with
this reminds me of a childhood story  early 00s  older sister tells mom shes gonna die her hair  mom youre gonna look super dumb  sister no itll look cool reeeeeee  the next day mom shows her just how stupid hair dying looks  gets an obnoxious pink hair dye kit  dyes her hair  she looked godammned stupid and was embarrassing to be seen with  mom you see this is how stupid youll look like when you dye your hair  sister never brought this up again
  how does one gets a based wife such as your mom
  shes right tho
  massive bundles of insecurities low self esteem and daddy issues

    they do not care about you or your opinion    of course they care about peoples opinions if they didnt their wouldnt be a market for clickbait articles about why you shouldnt judge x for y in 2018 or lets unpack why we look at x because of y or 10 things women with x are tired of hearing hair color weight lifestyle choices they care you care the only reason why you made such a passive aggressive post was because you care at least to some degree and thats fine lets have a conversation on the internet about it     women who dye their hair do it for one reason only because they think its pretty    women dye their hair for many reasons they may think its pretty like you said or they may indeed be trying to make some sort of punk rock statement about free expression or diversity or whatever then there are women like pic related who simply go through many different hair color changes and haircuts in quick succession to get as much attention as possible after all like you said women get crazy amount of attention from men and for women who are hungry for attention uglifying yourself is one way to do it especially if you cant compete with higher status women any attention is good attention and believe me even this stinking borderline hobo of a woman still gets plenty of flattering attention along with the bad from desperate lonely and indiscriminate men    why would they care about cutting out a large portion of men that they would feel uncomfortable around in the first place why do you think your evaluation of a womans hair factors into her decisions at all    because they arent cutting out neckbeards and neets how many high status men do you see walking around with pic related hmmmmmm im a 35 year old guy who has worked his ass off to make six figures a year while taking care of my body i sure with i could get locked down with some girl with a neon green bowl cut thats not reality
  i agree its cute and reminds me of something out of some magical girl anime or something
  yikes    get the fuck off my board
  le my board
  amazing i dont hate this woman
  can look pretty fucking great desu maybe some coorelation with being crazy but not as much as the incels in this thread think it is if your a young girl go for it hell even if your older or a dude go for it though for men the cut off is probably 30
i know im a small minority among men but i dont like dyed hair in general not just loud colors any dyed hair even naturalistic looking its fucking bad and shows insecurity about your natural attributes actually now that i think about it i find an obviously unnatural color like blue or white sometimes looks better than a hairdye thats trying to look natural      great mom
  oh damn son
  im a small minority among men but i dont like dyed hair  i think that most male 4chan users dislike dyed hair they say that fake blond is shit etc
  i think it looks cool
  my ex dyed her hair green about 4 inches from the ends and i really liked it
  thots and/or underage
looks like lil xans retarded little sister
does anyone else find it weird how her promotional pictures make her look way different than how she really does left is a promotional pic right is just a pic some media source took im almost convinced they use a lookalike
  depends what kind really   on guys generally speaking unless youre already popular as fuck its gonna like like the biggest cope for attention psychobilly dressers can do it but its so rare and you become that guy  for girls its usually aposematism to ward against mentally sane men if its some poorly applied dye which 99 usually are it can work it has to be a full dye though not that streaky shit unless your black    obnoxiously bright oranges greens and pinks work if you contrarily wear smartcasual clothing if you have please give me the attention my parents never gave me dyed hair you need to make your outfit counter that by dressing smarter you just look like some chick from futurama or a comic convention     please dont dye your hair to look more magical ie blues purples pastel colours   dyed hair isnt supposed to make you look more beautiful its to make you look more interesting its punk after all     apart from the acceptable fullcircleobnoxious neons the only realistically acceptable hair dyes are blonde white natural red black strawberry blonde
  bottom right blue hair  did she fucking draw a new cleavage with eyeliner fucking hell
  repelling sane men with money is productive to her future wellbeing  not repelling equally fucked in the head men is productive to her wellbeing    fucking say it to my face that a girl with dyed hair is not more easily manipulated than a girl with natural hair
  photoshop
  damaged goods
  only looks good on her because shes pretty shed look better with normal hair
  thats a guy
  id agree to a degree it would look awful on a ugly or mediocre girl but for this girl it makes her more exotic
  the type of girl who can swallow a banana whole
  runny mascara and that semiafraid look in the eyes as she chokes on it
  based
  god she was so hot in that movie i want her to poop all over me
  i love molly but shes an uggo
    i really dislike how incels and semiincels are so prevalent on the internet these days even cool ibs like 420 chan has some of them lately        the 4 on the bottom on the right are really cute    so much this 
  of course they care about peoples opinions  yep but they do not care about yours i am telling you and everybody else here that your opinion does not matter the girl you posted surely cares about the opinions of her friends and whatever subculture she identifies with  youre not part of it thus irrelevant    im not going to go ahead and pick out statements of the rest of your post because it all evolves around this one idea of people making decision on their life based on higher status women or higher status men this is an idea that exists in the minds of incels it literally does not even enter the thought process of well adjusted people the woman you posted doesnt care one bit that some conservative investment banker would show no interest in her  to her this man is not part of some social status scale he simply is incompatible with her based on her interests and lifestyle    the actual map of social value is not hierarchical it is decentralized governed by a seemingly endless multitude of factors that gather around each other
  shes a 7 who would become an 8 if she went back to her old hair and removed that cyst from her chin
  thats a paintbrush
  i was sitting on a couch not laying on a mattress lol
    where have all these redditors come from
  dont ever post this roach again
  this holy shit the amount of nasty green booger hair ive seen

  brother me
  no lid on the bottle
  like yikesposters are a new phenomenon
  post feet
  huh i never would have expected that color to look good but it do   tfw no warhol gf
  all that proves is that aposematism is the incorrect term for how men feel however it is the closest term available to describe the phenomenon dyed hair is literally a giant red flag
  a lookalike dude what professionals retouch pictures in photoshop all the time most of the time very dramatically its not body double conspiracy shit its just computers the left pic is so digital it barely looks like a photo the right looks like a cutie id love to hold hands with
    she looks amazing she knows exactly how she wants to look and her look probably correlates with her personality really well most people look boring and ugly girls like this are like a breath of fresh air      none of them look cute you desperate estrogen ridden simp if you dont wise up youre going to fall into a relationship with some borderline or something
  are you telling me that if one of these green haired bog witches encountered a normal man outside of her subculture that she was strongly attracted to she would care what he thought of her of course she would forget about money it could simply be a physically fit clean good looking selfsufficient man who paints houses or something i agree that there are a lot of factors that determines a persons value but it is hierarchical my friend works at the local welfare office she deals with a strata of people so low you will mostly likely never even encounter them in any social situation they have less value than zero they are a net loss on society their existence is entirely parasitical they provide nothing they do nothing they have no skills they are not good looking they are not even polite hierarchy is the way of the world and can be seen everywhere if you are just honest with yourself and use the power of observation
  shes an angel and i wish her a happy fulfilling life      nice but i would be embarassed to go out with a woman wearing a shirt that tight
  so much this  please go back to tumblr where you belong
  this is it  i have bleached ny hair to almost white and dye it whenever im bored also with this type of semipermanent dyes is very easy to switch because you give your hair two to five washes with head n shoulders and baking soda and it goes away
      half of /fa brought to its knees in 3 posts
  female undercuts and sideshaves are so fucking /fa/
  are you saying they smoke angel dust
  id fuck the shit out of her and treat her like trash
yall need to stop giving a fuck a about bitches who aint sucking ur dick     t black kid jerome
problem hair  no thanks
  this has gotta be bait   4chan was the first playground of the incels you dumb cunt
gf has pail blue hair and its sexy as fuck
  proofs
  shut up
  theyre often attractive despite their colored hair
  what the fuck how is this from one year ago i remember it like it was just 3 months ago or something
    holy shit it really has been that longi dont believe it
  they often have horible left wing political opinions that i hate yet still is colored hair dye my biggest weakness i love it to death   i think this is basically the male version of those girls that only like bad boys
  pail pale blue
  wouldnt call that pale but i like it
  they pretend to have depression or anxiety for attention 90 of the time
  based fernanda poster
      not really if youre to follow this premise it indicates they perceive themselves as prey    it also suggests that they believe that there are a swath of individuals out to get them which indicates a selfabsorbed personality
  christ what a unique individual
  make up different lighting slightly different expression hair covering face plus pic related    im almost convinced they use a lookalike  /pol/ tier retardation  they dont even look that different
  let me complain about incels on 4chan
    alright slow down there fellas shes 16
  i dated a girl who liked to color her hair and was legit paranoid schizophrenic it was hell so brightly colored hair tends to throw some alarms because of association with negative personal experience and then theres the sjw connection   but appart from those things i think it can be aesthetically appealing if done well by attractive people
      based
guys look cuter with it
reminder
  lol zach smith knows his shit
  lmao at the 8mm picture that makes him look like he belongs under a bridge in a dd campaign
      i be she thinks hes so funny
    oh fuck me too i thought this happened over the summer or something i remember being in that thread
  this is more interesting than the boring bleached light blond look about half of american women go for
  thats legal everywhere in the world except us of gay
  wish i could masturbate to her but i have to wait two years
  a tired apporpriation of something that was only semicool at best in the 80s and is plain dumb now    its funny how some think somethngs new just because its new to them no wonder why millenials and postmillenials have yet to come up with their own anything beyond the selfiestick
  they will almost always cheat/lie to you to keep up some facade they desperately cling too   not just women  you know who you are faggot
  broken mirrors ay sip now there was a thread
  most us states it is legal
  r u in cali
  didnt we have a poll a year or two ago where most of our userbase admitted to being under 18
  i think that your natural color matches the best your genes  on edgy people might look good but nothing can beat your own color
  it is 16 in most states anyway
  i unironically love it
  colored hair looks awesome it just has to be done properly one has to bleach their hair with minimal damage that can be quite expensive thats why a lot of girls with colored hair have short hair because their ends ended up looking shitty and raggedy and they had to chop it off not that i have a problem with short hair on girls either
  stay away there the worst
my first breakup was with a coloured hair girl when we were both 18  coincidentially she has fucked up any platonic or not relationship she ever had in her life and keeps acting victimized and full of complain and dysphoria regarding her surroundings till now 5 years later    it is mostly an attention thing they sure do think that a vibrant hair colour sure makes them stand out    secondarily its like the goth gf meme they fetishize their appearance to get the required attention and vanity through possibly fucking with people     its sure problematic as shit but we are in /fa where everyone is a slave to their own insecurites desu
  i hope you die
  yeah either way moralfagging should be an instant ban
  abby brown isnt the best example of such shit she is horribly retarded and mentally handicapped
    women doesnt know what they want and always make stupid decisions this is consequence of being raised like princess by their families they build no responsibility and when they got into all internet shit things only get worse all that social media is full of teenagers being together to support each other mistakes and bad personality thats their way to interact and make friends they solve problems being hysterical using other people feelings to prove theyre right in my experience the best girls are the ones that study have a hobby and arent that much into internet culture
  useful for making lampshades
if they have colored hair they probably like colored dick p
  she thinks its le epic burn but do you know what happens  all the attractive men avoid the girl with coloured hair so who is left that approaches her  ugly desperate dudes  not all ugly desperate dudes are sex predators but most sex predators are ugly desperate dudes
  which means if he finds it repulsive that probably says more about him than it does about us    get real bitch we have pattern recognition we see that all of you girls that just like colouring our hair for ourselves and no other reason are all fucked in the head and probably making yourselves ugly because your uncle rubbed your cunt when you were six years old    9999 of people arent that special and you can make all kinds of safe assumptions judging them by their cover
  a horrible decision is like thinking that an aggressive man is masculine and it will be a good partner thats the way to choose a man that will beat you up
  maybe i can agree with that depends on what you mean by aggression which i see as a positive trait in itself    ill give you an example i observed irl  a girl i knew had a bf and he was a mommys boy his mother did everything for him  but because he demanded those things in a spoiled and entitled way even though he was technically an adult this girl took his behaviour as actually being attractive in that he bossed a woman around to get what he wanted
  all women are queens
  this fucking response
  probably terrific in the sack malefemale or has the potential to be if dike but you get a few shots of liquor in her      burn it at the cross
rate my oneitis
  all the attractive men avoid the girl with coloured hair  that just doesnt happen kek believe it or not but most young men do not care at all about dyed hair
  looks like lots of trouble
  used to think it was hot when i was a teenager this was when that whole emo scene thing was going on now i think its gross because its usually some sjw retard thats a complete nutjob
  
  its a warning to stay far away
  is there any content of this fine young lady
  how does it feel knowing youve been crushed
not a fan i know one girl who dyed her hair blue not that saturated she usually makes it almost white she has fair skin and blue eyes and her ears are cute makes her look like an elf    i only like platinum really blonde almost white not a fan of the rest
  unironically this some people manage to look good by dying their hair but youll probably look your best with your natural hair
  gfl billie is ugly as sin
  local_gal
  i follow her on ig just wondering about more advanced content if you catch my drift
  seattle  e  a  t  t  l  e    pls respond
  opinion on girls w colored hair  meaning loud colors always a warning sign to be careful around them    from my experience 10 of them are really cool and laid back people definitely not the type to have a relationship with but good/funny conversation partners tolerant open minded funny although a bit weird    the other 90 are batshit insane in a rather discomforting way to be around a lot of swallowed up bitterness and suppressed complexes no sense of humor and very easily offended so youre better off not talking to them at all
theyll only hurt you if you get attached
  it just means they like variety in their lives  a variety of cock
  i hate it so goddamn much
  dude shes like a kindergarten teacher i doubt it
  in my experience the best girls are the ones that study have a hobby and arent that much into internet culture    big yes
  some girl with no selfrespect that i dont know or care about at one point was used as a cumsock by some brainlet body builder i dont feel anything but mild annoyance
usually its kind of trashy imo but it can be done right    pic related i think dahyuns purplish gradient look is pretty good
  its a warning becuse theyre poisonous you dumbass
  at one point
  i fell for two  it is not a meme   just like everything in nature  the thngs you should avoid colour themselves brightly  so you d o n t f u c k i n g t o u c h t h e m  those mentally ill creatures are not worth it   easy pussy thoe if youre desperate  wich you are  faggot
dyed hair was cool in the 90s when only punks and goths did it  now its a red flag
  massive jewess tier nose would probably have rough dehumanizing sex with tho like 67/10  not worth having oneitis over especially with the trash personality im assuming she has by body language style and the dirty state of her mirror get over her and get better faggot
  thats a fuckin guy
  jesus christ she looks like garbage
  god i hate this fucking roastie and her ugly ass eyebrows
  lmfao poisonous to predators not potential mates fuckboy
  kek
  just like everything in nature  the thngs you should avoid colour themselves brightly  you heard him guys dont eat any fruit
  i did and will always stinky fucking roasties
  i hate her eyebrows too but dont pretend you wouldnt fuck her the instant you got a chance
  hot
only if youre ramona flowers
  even cool ibs like 420 chan  so much this  holy shit kys      this is epic sexual predators btfod
  shefat
blonde/black/brown/ginger is fine weird colours make those cunts look like hideous fat lesbians
  yeah but youre an incel a nonfactor
  lol no im not
kinda sad that hair dyeing is now a sign of sjws or sensitive lefties who will shout at you when i was growing up it was a sign that the girl was edgy probably into serial killers and metal or industrial music maybe kinky my first gf had blue hair shes the one who introduced me to racism and nazi shit years before /pol/ existed she was a good girl    pic somewhat related not her but what i recall fondly
  yes hello great and mighty grand champion is there anything you need
  theyre either really nice and funny or theyre mean but theyre all going through something
are juuls /fa/ now
  maybe rdditcom/r/mfa is more youre stylr
  ive seen them used many times by multiple people and i have never once thought that person is fashionable so nope imo
  nigga every template you see has a pack of smokes the fuck do you think
  no
  just smoke real cigarettes you faggot
  based
they just released a crimson juul for the holidays    they are abg magnets which means if you smoke a juul youll pull more pussy
vapes  nah but now that theyre being restricted theyre hip with the normalfags
  implying they werent always
  theyre even more hip with the normalfags  you happy now faggot
  what do you want to hear because i could go either way on this
  key word smokes not a pocket size monolith
vaping is straight up dumb and doesnt have an aesthetic cigarettes are much more /fa/
  cigarettes have an aesthetic  ive been a very heavy smoker for years and years and there isnt a single thing cool about smoking its fucking disgusting and shouldnt be viewed as anything but
    the only cool thing about ciggies are the boxes
  ive quit smoking cigs and im going to get a vape lots of people find smoking really unattractive plus it makes you age badly look sallow and sickly and you start smelling bad   some people do pull off the smoker look but only if theyre attractive and very thin
theyre not /fa/ but they dont look bad either the only reason people shit on them is because of highschool fags
  kids and their pearlclutching moms ruin everything last i heard the fda ordered juul to stop restocking suppliers with pods due to all the negative press they got from underage usage i liked being able to continue my nicotine habit without smelling like an ashtray but i suppose i should see this as a sign to finally quit altogether
theyre pretty fucking gay so yes
  i think how it works is that resellers can only sell mint and tabacco flavor you just cant buy mango fruit medley and creme brulee
  you can still buy all flavours from their online store
  the only thing worth vaping is weed and even then i only do it for health benefits over smoking
  its flavored tobacco  but it literally isnt
  people who say retarded shit like smoking is an aesthetic should kill themselves nothing is cool about smoking you fucking tool
  theres nothing effay about slowly killing yourself same goes for the glorification of drug use its disgusting unclean and leads you down a rabbithole of problems taking care of your body treating it well and ensuring your skin isnt damaged is truly effay
  cigs are cool      i hope youre underage
thoughts on adidas busenitz
the depressed and drug addicted offspring of the campus and gazelle
  great shoes for skating in imo
  theyre kinda cool heres kanye wearing them
one of the most popular skate shoes of all time im talking about skating not lifestyle or fashion they are the best selling adidas skate shoes and have been in continuous production since their release i myself have 3 pairs that i rotate for skating also busenitz is a legend
  copped a pair for half off fit is a bit narrow so size up work well for biking solid sole for good downforce can see why skaters like em
  this is the best description of a shoe ive ever seen
ive been searching for a tank top like the one in pic related for like a week at least now can someone please tell me wtc its almost like a grail of mine at this point lol
  people who wear tank tops smell bad
how do i dress for women  i dont give a single fuck about the latest fashion or expressing myself or any of that limpwrist shit i just want to look good by female standards
  type malefashion into instagram and do what all those skinny jeans wearing fucks do unuronically
  get /fit/ and wear clothes that show off your physique    bam you get girls
what kind of pants are those
i recommend slim fit
why isnt he wearing his perfectly tailored denim jacket from drive is tailoring a meme
  because he probably couldnt move his arms in it
  this however if you gravitate towards a certain type or types take into account what styles the type of guys they like would wear like attracts like is one example if one can also be true themselves in their sartorial choices theyll wear those clothes better dont dress like a dad if youre 20 is an easy one
    take a look at the what are you wearing todaythreads here on /fa/  and do the opposites    women dont like rick owens tech ninjas
  dressing for women  you need to get fucked by real men along with the hoes youre trying to pursue with your faggotery mentality nigga
  probably levi 511
  go to reddit and ask them
  step 1 be conventionally attractive  step 2 wear literally anything
dressing up for women is beta per definitionem
  this youve already lost if youre approaching women with this kind of cucked mindset
    these posters are right be fit and handsome and you can wear anything  be holocaust mode  obsess over clothes work on fits buy expensive clothing  females didnt know i existed  fuck it gym becomes my new hobby  put on tons of muscle mass and become fit  now i can just wear boots jeans and a white henley and i look so much better than i ever did when i cared about /fa/  bitches frequently saying i look great and have such good fashion sense  literally just wear jeans/chinos and henley  feels surreal man  in short go 
you need to be attractive women dont care what you wear as long as its not totally fucking gross or ridiculous like a star wars tshirt also overdressing is a thing many women are turned off by guys who dress too well
  okay gymcel
  he is right if you actually are that desperate and that boring personalitywose lifting will get you laid eventually especially if youre in college  however vast majority of guys dont need that to get laid

why do normies have to steal one of the best shoes for skating aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
  not just wearing what you want because you like it  never gonna make it
  giving a shit about literally anything other people do unless it directly affects you  probably skates for the look in the first place  being under 18 and posting    based
  what the fuck are you talking about old skools are shitty skate shoes youll tear through them in a 2 hour skate session these shoes are like converse chuck taylors both shoes suck for their intended sport
  because they were deigned for skating and its fags like you that blew its price up over the past 15 years because you just couldnt find literally any other shoe to obsess over
    trying to be different    youre not gonna make it
  vans are literal shit for skateboarding and have shit build quality in general you giant faggot nike sbs like janoskis or adidas skate shoes last literally two times as long also if youre over 20 and not semi pro stop skating you look like a retard
  black old skool vans without stripe are the patrician choice and arent normie meme core
  
not wearing authentics
they skate transition pretty gud but i recommend the pro av in black doesnt tear because toecap and you dont look like normie poser scum
  skating in authentics    good bye big toe
  fpbp
  thats even worse to skate in its like skating in converse chucks
whats the best skating shoe
i use these ones for skating  not because i love them but because i bought them some good years ago before i was fashionable so i know i can rip them up without worry
best skating shoe  not nike dunk pros
  fags like you that blew its price up over the past 15 years  vans blew up the prices buddy lets not forget that they are a business
  chucks are awesome for skating if you like the toe cap
    its not a good shoe for skating though terrible arch support and thin soles make for fucked up feet maybe if all your flip tricks hover 2  off he ground and you dont skate transitions
    stop having fun     the post
  weee wooooo weee wooooo    someone is insecure
  red pill me on those i usually skate nike blazers since their much slimmer
   normies   skating  pick both please
another who isnt me is a normie
  im not that anon but dunks are super comfortable and the cushioning helps protect my foot if i land wrong the fat tongue versions also feel much more secure around my ankle which is very nice for skating also their size makes them great for winter as well
  zoom  air
  probably the ankle support
  if you are over the age of 14 and skate you need to kys
if you have a hobby over the age of 14 you need to kys
    my insecurities dont change the fact that vans are terrible shoes for skateboarding
  post clips or else u larping  vans pro are valid to skate in       u cant wear these if ur not kevin rodriguez       coverse ctas      lmfaooo      why arent all u  niggas in the r/skateboarding discord
  send an invite
  r/skateboarding  i wouldnt touch leddit with a 5 foot pole
where can i cop something similar but with jew friendly pricing
  suede blazer allsaints on sale    i bought something similar and while it looks cool theres barely any ocassion you can wear it to
  this thing is waxed cotton and 250 cheaper than that
  looks like a brown paper bag
  i can guarantee that jacket and anything close to it will be garbage youre better off copping this patagonia mens iron forge hemp canvas ranch jacket for 179    i own this jacket and it fits me perfectly and keeps me dumb warm here in new england    in this jacket im a size small and 60 160lbs

okay /fa/  redpill me on skincare  whats the bare minimum i should do  whats your daily routine  t skin is generally pretty good aside from blackheads
  i eat liver once every week  thats literally enough to make my skin glow
  my skin isnt model tier but i have no scarring or large pores or regular zits  you dont have to be as strict with diet as that thing says imo but supplementing zinc is good for men in general because your cum has a lot of zinc in it and i know youre jerking it 6 times a week  i get like 23 zits on my forehead if i eat a lot of cookies or anything else thats mainly sugar but otherwise i can eat pizza and cheeseburgers all day  other than that i just take pic related to my face in the shower in the morning and im good  ive found that using any products makes it worse
  honestly i bought the shit bateman used and my skin has been smooth and comfy as fuck    you exfoliate at most twice a week that shits abrasive and can damage raw skin  dont do it too much dont  i use a cucumber derived face mask whereas bateman used mint i prefer cucumber because i have an argan oil styling gel for my hair and i think the cucumber adds a crisp freshness while still maintaining a watery fruity foundation the mask is applied three times a week  i had terrible acne but medicated my face clean now i use a benzol peroxide solution to keep my complexion clear i know what youre going to say alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older true twice a week max never on the same day you exfoliate   lotion on the neck and body neck especially if youre like me and get a dry scaly fucking neck sometimes daily moisturizer face and neck again twice daily you can have the smoothest healthiest skin in the world it wont matter if its so fucking dry it cracks and shit moisturize its not a joke  also important try not to touch your face throughout the day you dont want any more skin oils which could potentially clog pores or glob up on some of the product you use gross
  i tie a plastic ice pack around my face and commence with the mornings stretching exercises afterwards i stand in front of a chrome and acrylic washmobile bathroom sink  with soap dish cup holder and railings that serve as towel bars which i bought at hastings tile to use while the marble sinks i ordered from finland are being sanded  and stare at my reflection with the ice pack still on i pour some plax antiplaque formula into a stainlesssteel tumbler and swish it around my mouth for thirty seconds
  then i squeeze rembrandt onto a faux tortoiseshell toothbrush and start brushing my teeth too hung over to floss properly  but maybe i flossed before bed last night and rinse with listerine then i inspect my hands and use a nailbrush i take the icepack mask off and use a deeppore cleanser lotion then an herbmint facial masque which i leave on for ten minutes while i check my toenails then i use the probright tooth polisher and next the interplak tooth polisher this in addition to the toothbrush which has a speed of 4200 rpm and reverses direction fortysix times per second the larger tufts clean between teeth and massage the gums while the short ones scrub the tooth surfaces i rinse again with cepacol i wash the facial massage off with a spearmint face scrub
  the shower has a universal alldirectional shower head that adjusts within a thirtyinch vertical range its made from australian goldblack brass and covered with a white enamel finish in the shower i use first a wateractivated gel cleanser then a honeyalmond body scrub and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub vidal sassoon shampoo is especially good at getting rid of the coating of dried perspiration salts oils airborne pollutants and dirt that can weigh down hair and flatten it to the scalp which can make you look older the conditioner is also good  silicone technology permits conditioning benefits without weighing down the hair which can also make you look older
  on weekends or before a date i prefer to use the greune natural revitalizing shampoo the conditioner and the nutrient complex these are formulas that contain dpanthenol a vitaminbcomplex factor polysorbate 80 a cleansing agent for the scalp and natural herbs over the weekend i plan to go to bloomingdales or bergdorfs and on evelyns advice pick up a foltene european supplement and shampoo for thinning hair which contains complex carbohydrates that penetrate the hair shafts for improved strength and shine also the vivagen hair enrichment treatment a new redken product that prevents mineral deposits and prolongs the life cycle of hair luis carruthers recommended the aramis nutriplexx system a nutrient complex that helps increase circulation
  did you have acne before
  once out of the shower and toweled dry i put the ralph lauren boxers back on and before applying the mousse a raiser a shaving cream by pour hommes i press a hot towel against my face for two minutes to soften abrasive beard hair then i always slather on a moisturizer to my taste clinique and let it soak in for a minute you can rinse it off or keep it on and apply a shaving cream over it  preferably with a brush which softens the beard as it lifts the whiskers  which ive found makes removing the hair easier it also helps prevent water from evaporating and reduces friction between your skin and the blade always wet the razor with warm water before shaving and shave in the direction the beard grows pressing gently on the skin leave the sideburns and chin for last since these whiskers are tougher and need more time to soften rinse the razor and shake off any excess water before starting afterwards splash cool water on the face to remove any trace of lather you should use an aftershave lotion with little or no alcohol never use cologne on your face since the high alcohol content dries your face out and makes you look older one should use an alcoholfree antibacterial toner with a watermoistened cotton ball to normalize the skin
  applying a moisturizer is the final step splash on water before applying an emollient lotion to soften the skin and seal in the moisture next apply gel appaisant also made by pour hommes which is an excellent soothing skin lotion if the face seems dry and flaky  which makes it look dull and older  use a clarifying lotion that removes flakes and uncovers fine skin it can also make your tan look darker then apply an antiaging eye balm baume des yeux followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion a scalpprogramming lotion is used after i towel my hair dry i also lightly blowdry the hair to give it body and control but without stickiness and then add more of the lotion shaping it with a kent natural bristle brush and finally slick it back with a widetooth comb

guy that went from having slight chest/backne/pimples to being complimented on his skin  heres some things i know now    1 like with lifting letting skin heal is just as critical as the routine youre using  the amount of cleaning/products you use / how good our skin will be in fact a lot of people unknowingly create their own skin problems by being too harsh with their skin your routine should have the goal of allowing the best conditions for healthy skin growth which are most likely at least slightly different than those of strangers learn what works best for you    2 start with washing your face daily  first wash your hands then wash your face with water wash with light cleanser and rub your skin in circular motions with light pressure 2030 seconds for the entire face should be enough going harder on pimples doesnt make them heal any faster    3 get a solid clean nonbullshit moisturizer apply small amount to face very lightly spread and let absorb only use as much as gets absorbed gently pat with clean towel if you have too much on    4 about once a week physically exfoliate  again dont be harsh light to medium pressure circular motions dont do it for too long moisturize afterwards note that for some people physical exfoliation is too harsh in which case you should try a salicylic acid exfoliant and work your way up if its too light    5 for your body you should follow vaguely the same routine  exfoliation is instead done with either a washing cloth like   or exfoliating gloves just use a nice clean moisturizing bodywash throughout the rest of the week if you feel like youre overdrying your skin consider that you might be showering in water thats too hot or too harsh    6 dont sleep with dirty clothes on dont mess with your face without washing your hands switch your pillowcase and sheets once in a while

meat helps to raise tor which leads to acne and has zero antioxidants to stop acne green vegetables are good but berries and nuts are generally the most antioxidant rich foods what a shitty guide          
what exfoliater should i cop today    also go to your dermatologist and ask for minocyclin your skin will be clear within 15 weeks
  this is solid advice   i would add sunscreen in the summer and retinol for people with severe acne or some wrinkles    remember my dudes acne is like a tiny infected wound dont pick at or scrub at wounds keep it clean and moist and your body will heal it on its own
  ive been using green tea leaves to scrub my face after cleansing 1  2 x a week  makes my skin super smooth its cheap teabag gentle yet effective the antioxidants in green tea are really good for the skin everyone should drink green tea everyday to prevent acne
when i wash my face in the shower i only use a wet washcloth with no soap but thats enough to dry my face out if i dont moisturize should i get a moisturizing face wash i use the original nivea creme daily
these are literally the only things you need for skincare less is more

  cut out all the junk  plenty of fat faggots have clear faces this diet is missing plenty of beneficial micronutrients drinking water is good though  zinc  only improves test in test deficient individuals so probably good for the fags here youre also mixing it up with biotin  fish oil  doesnt do anything about acne you just saw it in a recommended supplements post  vitamin a  potentially toxic if you are taking it the same way accutane works massive overdose accutane is also a derivative of vitamin a not the same exact thing you buy at walmart  bp  used to treat acne i would try sulfur instead though  wash face once a day  entirely dependent on how oily your face is  meme diets  no  weed  no      going to experiment with dermarolling tomorrow seen some good results online use a sunscreen that works for you as well
  try cutting back on the scrubbing maybe limit to every other day you need some dead skin on your face to retain water  also you could try adding a hydrating serum or lightweight oil eg rosehip squalane jojoba under your cream

  supplements wont do shit for your face acne ive had really bad acne in the past went through accutane and whittled it down to minor acne and scarring and ive finally started to improve my postaccutane skin    you need  a gentle phbalanced cleanser cerave or cetaphil branded moisturizing cleanser    chemical exfoliants  benzoyl peroxide leaveon gel use this for spot treatment and let dry remove after 30 min  1 hour and salicylic acid ideally stridex alcohol free maximum strength pads    moisturizer something gentle that youve tested on your skin that does not produce further breakouts  i use lubiderm daily moisture lotion with sunscreen spf 15    drink water and eat relatively well diet has not been formally linked to acne in studies but its likely that dairy causes issues for some and garbage fast food/snacks should be eaten occasionally at best if you want to play things safe and be /fa/ in taking care of your health water is definitely important but is not an end all solution to acne as some dumbasses think it helps though
    optional  occlusives/semiocclusives aquaphor or less ideally vaseline can be used to trap moisturizer into your face and lips this makes a big difference for me but might not for everyone    retinoids/retinal  i use differin aka adapalene which is the most powerful variant available over the counter in the us though other countries may not have access you use a pea size amount on your face before bed and spread around entire face takes at the very least 46 weeks to produce effects which arent guaranteed until around 12 weeks for some this will force skin cell growth and will make a significant impact on acne and scarring but be warned that your skin may purge get slightly to significantly worse before the effects can be noticed my purging lasted 2 weeks after 2 weeks without noticeable effect and now i can see my skin improving significantly slow down on use of skincare products other than gentle cleanser twice a day and moisturizer before using this and gradually reintroduce otherwise you might have unnecessary drying/flaking      sunscreen  pretty essential if youre in the sun frequently and wish to avoid sundamage/uneven pigmentation the sunscreen i use is build into my moisturizer but you may need stronger than 15 spf depending on the climate and time of year    hydrating toner  these allow water to be drawn into your skin and can be especially helpful if you suffer from dry skin and dont like the greasy feel/dont react well to tradiitional oilbased moisturizers eg mineral oil coconut oil etc you need to read up on how to use these correctly before you use them i use habo labo gokujyun lotion and it works well though ive taken it out my routine since starting differin    aha  this will improve skin texture and tone but will not act as deeply on acne as bhas such as salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide i use alpha skin care essential renewel lotion 10 glycolic aha
      do nots    dont use physical exfoliation ever shit is terrible for your face and can cause micro tears which make it easier for bacteria/fungi to enter your skin and infect it this includes those asian washclothes fine for body not for face and st ives type scrubs basically bits of shredded walnuts that will create microtears iin your face and damage your skin even more    dont rely on vitamin supplements other than vitamin a they probably dont have much of a noticeable effect on acne and vitamin a is dangerous as a fatsoluble vitamin that your body cant remove in excess this is the purpose of retinoids or isotretinoin/accutane in your routine since these are medically established to improve acne unlike supplements    dont push too many products on yourself or combine products freely without testing with more powerful products you will likely need to patch test other products eg if youre on differin you would only want to test a small patch of benzoyl peroxide on your skin to avoid a harsh reaction/irritation all the products i listed can be useful but which ones you may need depends on your skin type and acne severity
  differin  that shit is great got it prescribed by my derm after doing accutane and it has reduced my scars and inflammation a lot
    shit nvm i use epiduo

post nihilistic looking fashion inspo  anything dark and moody but still clean and smart looking
nihilistic   smart  pick one
  generalising  smart  pick one
  kek i meant smart looking collared shirts including some dressier/more formal pieces i swear some of you faggots will come into a thread just for the purpose of shitting on it
this thread again a nihilist wouldnt put in as much effort probably wears all black covered in cat hair and dried mucus with a cigarette being the only effay accessory theyre too contrarian to wear anything attractive or original
  thus the appeal   i think most can appreciate some tasteful aloofness
  i dislike all the super skinny fits once upon a time there was a thread about postwar japanese nihilism lots of baggy fits in black with a variety of complementing textures when you go monochrome texture is the single most important part of the fit tomorrow i will be wearing all black i have black heavy wool trousers a cable knit turtleneck cashmere scarf black leather jodhpur boots all heavy winter textures all properly fitting not tight not baggy an appealing amount of drape all topped with a tailored wool coat midsized gold watch with black leather strap texture matters and so does fitment dont go too tight or baggy
this is what actual nihilistic hedonistic that have no self respect or goals are wearing in public
  exactly its called throwing on pajama pants and a stained shirt/hoodie while chain smoking cigarettes with your 5 bastard children accessories bonus aesthetic points if you fight with retail cashiers because your coupon is expired true nihilism
  any images from this thread you could share/this fit
imagine being this much of a pseud
  karasuzoku  ill post some pics hol up
  this is wrong im a nihilist and im not contrarian at all i listen to drake and party on weekends wearing blacks and greys with clean silhouettes
  i listen to drake and party on weekends    lmao
  i dont have the photos on my computer but look at commes de garcon 8085 catalogs lots of all black inspo also yohji yamamotos stuff is all black outfits too like i said before all black becomes about texture and drape as any monochrome outfit you need variety and complimentary texture in the same color to be aesthetic the cut needs to fit your body and the nature of the outfit
  whats your favorite wikipedia page on nihilism fag
  why are you so threatened
  threatened  i was just pointing out that the vast majority of self identifying nihilists have done little to no actual reading on the subject and are usually just depressed or trying to make an excuse for being a degenerate by saying it doesnt matter
  ok good i thought you were some lame intimidated by people who arent afraid to be honest with themselves due a lack of your own selfhonesty someone afraid of being called a pseudointellectual or pretentious and the like to clarify i would never push nihilism on other people nor do i take any pride in my position
  cont i dont think im smarter than laymen or that i have the nature of reality figured out or that im better than anyone i also like nice for what and gods plan
true nihilist wear is just wearing fuck all because you dont care what you look like
  nihilist core
if nothing matters why the fuck would dressing a certain way matter
  self proclaimed nihilists are psuedo philosopher hipsters who only know how be a pompous pretentious dick to get laid i hope you dont go telling people irl youre a nihilist zoomer a third of modern nihilists are irredeemable antifa trannies with no personality   you cant be certain the npcs you talk to are real but they stroke your ego which gives you confidence to dress like a basic bitch  true nihilists dont even call themselves nihilists that word gets thrown around a lot youre most likely an egoist max stirner type than a narcissistic big lebowski fuck everything type
  i just told you i take no pride in my position nor do i look down on anyone and no i dont mention it to anyone irl
  how 2 get this look when broke
   im a nihilist   cringe   i listen to drake and party on weekends  oh god make it stop

  black slacks are sold everywhere mainly look at thrift stores make sure they are heavy wool or borderline tweed dont get super thin ones i literally buy most of my clothes from goodwill i drive to every side of town for work so i always run to goodwill to check stuff out got a overcoat for 6 turtleneck you just have to buy desu find a reasonably priced cableknit amazon has some you can make this outfit happen for under 100 including shoes if you try under 200 easy and everything can be tailored and mostly new
  again all black is always about texture make the textures compliment each other
  i listen to drake  nice pink moon is a favorite of mine
            wearing black clothing has absolutely nothing to with nihilism you larping faggot teenagers    based and coenpilled
    what the fuck does wearing black have to do with nihilism    are you unironically underaged to the point where you believe nihilism is some emo edgy 2edgy4u ideology    dude i swear this board is so fucking cringe
  redpilled
a true nihilist which in theory cant really even exist wouldnt be doing any of this shit  caring about appearance  caring about what others think of them  posing for photos to show off  sharing said photos to show off  wearing designer clothes  posting on an image board to garner approval and or inspiration
    only 2 posts worth looking at in the thread  im off to dig through the archive for the postwar jap one
a true nihilist is just a depressed teenager like all you angsty fucks are grow up reminder nietzsche btfod nihilism and thinks youre all retards not advocated for it
  look up karasuzoku aka crow tribe  also look at 1980s yohji and commes de garcon catalogs lots of good all black fits

i dont care about anything except the way my fashion taste defines me

  kierkegaard is not a fucking nihilist
  are you unironically underaged to the point where you believe nihilism is some emo edgy 2edgy4u ideology    you dont have to be underaged to believe that you just have to have a modicum of intelligence
  thats weird because i never implied he was
  yet he influenced nietzsche albeit indirectly and the existentialists
  nietzsche isnt a nihilist
  nihilist core  stupidest shit ive ever heard of
  jesus christ
nihilism means you arent allowed to give a shit about anything and if you ever care or try youre just a larping pseudointellectual
nihilism / just dressing in black    a true patrician
  nietzsche isnt a nihilist existentialists arent nihilists nihilists are extremely rare in the first place because it is an immature position only the immature and confused/depressed hold it is concentrated teenage angst any mature and stable human being is able to recognize value in the world it is not hard

what does /fa/ think of buying reps
depends on fake what some fake shoes are acceptable and the same or even better quality than what you buy at your local aldo or whatever
  only if its streetwear
depends on what youre buying anything leather wool or denim up to a certain point is a no go t shirts and basic shit is fine i dont really wear sneakers often only boots really so someone else can probably speak better on that than me
  no one has seen the real 950s so i say cop
  its based and redpilled
depends on what its a fake of    ill probably buy whatever aliexpress fake bethesda used for that fallout 76 promo backpack after someone finds the exact model they bought    yes i know milsurp is better its gonna be used for cycling not anything actually rugged
as long as you are not walking and acting like its real and bragging about it i think it is fine    i have one of those gucci denim sherpa jackets with the embroidered patches its not 11 but is gorgeous either way i get lots of compliments but i never say oh its gucci
should people with big feet wear highprofile shoes or lowprofile
  im size 12 and i wear boots because they look aesthetic at that size
  are we talking normal big or freakishly big
  normal big like size 12/13
  youre gonna want to wear shoes that scale well a lot of larger shoes add extra rows of laces along the tongue giving the shoe that clown shoe look avoid shoes like converse or any shoes where the laces run the length of the shoe low profile will accentuate the length of your foot what you really want to preserve is proportionality
  im a size 14 work boots and simplistic one color sneakers like stan smiths look best on me i think i have a pair of chucks and they look like submarines because of how big they are
  yes chucks look awful on big feet like clown shoes

  you bought white fila sneakers might as well write i suck 5 cocks a day on your forehead
  solid color low top vans on a girl get me rock hard

  i like this i think the jacket would look better unbuttoned but do whatchu gotta do to stay warm anon
  i was going for   i wasnt going for   fixed
  i think this would look better if you unrolled your pants or wore pants that were a little slimmer and covered your ankle the colors are nice though
  i wasnt trying to be rude but honestly if you cant handle criticism just dont post
  now youve made me selfconscious  why are you putting pictures of yourself online if you get rattled by complete strangers this easily

  way to make the thread worse with this one
  bluecollar core
open to advice
  pretty nice but align your belt properly  also 
  hot garbage
  fucking nice ce fleece is so gd    v nice
fairly basic today       i think they look fine how youre wearing them      better photo than outfit but nice nonetheless      shoes could use some beating up but this is great otherwise      love the top but your legs look like overstuffed sausages      clean
  its a look the misshapen tuck looks weird without the jacket though      whats up with the layering on top its a little too busy i might just hate the color combination though idk
  teach me to dress like you senpai
  lose weight    retard core works better if youre fat    you wear like a afrojap i follow on the internet you dont quite have it right but you should just experiment to get it right desu    time to get some new jeans and also shirt and jacket    i recommend starting from scratch    you look fine although id bully you irl    that jacket looks pretty big desu    larpcore    looks good although i dont quite get what is going on    you look like the lowiq runny fags from my old high school    proportions socks    looking good anon id get jeans of different than black    i recommend starting from scratch    nice look anon    wageslave core but its fine    shave all off loose weight new glasses never make that face again    good work anon i dont love the jacket but its cool anyway    i recommend starting from scratch    those shoes are ugly    bad personality    im laughing but you look good get fitter    i recommend starting from scratch    you look pretty lame would look better without the clothes    get rid of the scalf and get pants and shirt that fit a bit and youd look fine even with the monochrome    also eat yourslef fitter    start from scratcj
right
  dig it    what shirt is that
  i dont know much about gay fashion but looks good
  im glad i made you laugh i guess anything in particular
  nu privet
  w2c arm splint
im on that grind                    good/cute
  why did you do it to em
  i have a gf you fag
  i bet you hanged that honky bitch gayfag
  fair enough in my defense the shirt is too thick for a full tuck to be comfy      take the slim fit pill  wear dark solid colours  add a handful of accessories  stop eating and put your grocery budget towards shoes and outerwear
  w2c gf thats into breatheplay
  w2c pants    whats your height and weight
  ebat bydlo
  are u the cute asian guy that always dresses like a god
  like the boots and jacket also like the jeans good fat buddy
few days ago bc ive been lounging today
  nice dog
  tres effay what shoes are those
  what jeans are those
  ccp prosthetic drips     zam minimalist slim pants that he gave to me lmao
first time posting here tips are very welcomed ty      looks good but i dont like those blue shoes at all      looks good but it seems like the gloves are a bit overkill as it doesnt looks to be that cold outside      this looks pretty good      not a fan of those jeans color other than that it looks fine
  youre always supportive of my fits thx _
  it was 20f and windy so i can assure you it wasnt overkill didnt want to freeze while walking my dog
  ever heard about straight cut trousers bitch boy
i know the shoes are off but i dont have boots yet       wear socks     cringe    alright gayboy    good because its interesting     ok    unflattering for your proportions    hahaahah good    basic    best so far still not very good    good silhouette contrast    its fine you look different than most people so thats a plus    i dont understand this    nice birthing hips    how do you think this is fashion    clean    good i dont like the shoes too much    bad pants dont fit jacket looks dumb on this pic    best itt for now id the fucking pants please    noose    good i actually like the tuck here    too busy and proportions are off    huge meh    okay    so good with the dog i love it    looks normal i wouldnt look at you for more than a second glancing over your outfit
  those pants
  your fit is horrible
  this is the what the guy who rates you looks like
    why are you guys always so mean im just trying my best baka
  alright gayboy  nice birthing hips  how do you think this is fashion  noose  those who live in glass houses should not throw stones
  like a rick astley cosplay but worse
  holy fuck this is bad     theres so much wrong that im not sure anyone can help you out of this
  i know the shoes are off  the entire fit is off what the fuck u talking about
  its bad but it isnt that terrible and no im not the anon in the pic  the allblack base is fine and both the sweater and trousers fit well the jacket is a nice point of contrast even if it is a little sporty  if he ditched the ugly brown belt and got some chunky black derbies or combat boots itd be a solid fit
  its like a mix of fortniteplayerwhoshadenoughoftheschoolbullies school shooter and dicklet flasher lmao
  900 boots  black skinny jeans  sleeps on wooden pallets    hedi would be proud
  fuck off cg go dip those shoes of yours
my shoes are gross but thats just because im wearing them until i cant anymore    also this is like my second time ever posting here so i dont think im qualified to r8 others
  i dont think youre qualified to post too
  nothing fits well what the fuck are you talking about holy shit you people here suck at fashion    just compare  with 
  oof
  i actually think the concept is cool but theres something off about the proportions
gucci  destination  levis 512  acne
  post fit loser
how do i improve this
  top proportions look a bit too big for the pants so id say wear less voluminous layers
  did you take this in bv lmao
  get busy roasting
  does this suck and if so how can i make it not suck
skinny fit anything     the future is now boomers
  everyone is qualified brudda no qualifications for being on 4chan
  not necessarily but it gives a kind of unfashiony vibe some contrast could be nice and some more variation in colour or more interesting layering maybe even a different jacket other than that theres nothing wrong about it but it could be better by far but so could legitimately every fit above
  id on jacket
  its a black denim jacket i bought off depop a while ago brand is rivers island
  just search military belt on ebay havonalabs take months to get to you and alyx is hella spenny
  would not let you anywhere near my children
  passing transgender/10    very cute but not super /fa/ theres just too much contrast imo but still super cute      we have different definitions of skinny fit      i like the jacket pants are eh backpack is gay      evocative of mac demarco      silhouette contrast is too much especially for someone so short not that being short is especially bad or anything      breddy gud but i cant help but feel like you spent too much money for what you got out of it
  and no im not the anon in the pic
  be honest how old are you
  shoes are too blocky for the fit good concepts re skinny jeans  big top half and layering though
  enjoyed looking at this  w2c pants are they just bootcut jeans
  evocative of mac demarco    ive literally never listened to him but it isnt hate so ill take it        agree that the backpack is gay too also too monochrome
  they are actually navy pleated dockers that have been cut off
i wish somebody would simply tell me how i should dress i dont want to express myself i just want to look acceptable
  how to look acceptable  fast fashion plain block t shirts  fast fashion slim/skinny fitting jeans  black and white vans old skool  in the winter add an overhead hoodie or basic fisherman sweater
  go full zucc  many other famous people also just stick to one wardrobe   find good basics good jeans trousers and simple low shoes and a pair of boots a good coat and jacket buy quality with focus on material fit and colours bring some contrast or hues that darken the appearance   stick to this workout and eat simple but good and you wont have anything to complain about    personally id just buy some plain tshirts and shirts in the sales after christmas a pair of common projects converse or vans and some mid range jeans or trousers 100200 keep it simple anon
  based and redpilled

  i fucking hate my height ruins every fit 177 cm

    thank you
  scraggly but not too bad    same as other anon pants color is off    not feelin pants    white on the jacket looks pretty bad turtleneck too loose shoes bad    overcoat doesnt fit without would be alright    very scraggly generally i say ripped pants are a larp but youre okay i guess    nice
    very nice
  get a heavy break on your pants next time and tailor them so they fit or grow into them or something      prince of the trailer park core      does not pass lmfao      wearing floods in the current year  looks good besides that except you are cursed to be 13 forever      meh should definitely get a backpack that isnt fucking blue it doesnt match shit      if you are trying to look like a dirty hippy you nailed it      lose the faggy glasses but besides that looks alright relace the shoes to something not retarded      jacket doesnt fit but alright besides that
    really like it do you have by any chance any pics of fits in hot weather curious as to what you would wear in the summer
  yeah the pants do go a bit low ill definitely bring to tailor
  yeah fuck off with that noise    as the other anon said nothing fits and he has a bunch of contradictory materials/cuts    its really bad
  cut off too fuckin short
  thank you for the critqiue  i definitely want to do more stuff in the future d
  ahus co ty odpierdalasz
  i think its actually the angle of my phone or mirror the pants arent really cut that short irl
im a fucking faggot
  when are we gonna date btw
  dont ever fucking post again unless you want me to break your greasy sausage fingers annoying tripfag
  do it i fucking dare you
  im literally blind if i dont have my glasses and bitches love em
  those are rick fakes right
wish i could find more obvious waffle tees      really neat but could use some more contrast      fleck is always comfy      nice      love the cav empt with the shoes      is the jacket just the flecktarn liner
  thanks  here you go mate
  w2c boots
  yeah its just a flecktarn liner lol

5 dollar dad shirt from sears   pignosegang
  thanks again  you pretty much nailed my style i also go for a bitfascist in the winter months    check the milspo threads i try to post there but in the last year or so ive been really disappointed in the quality of posters on /facebook  been lurking here since 2013 decided to start posting right when the board started declining oh well
changed my jeans and shirt how does this look    looks pretty good    not good at all    saint laurent indiana jones
  is this a joke honestly what made you think you should post this
  eminem is the best rapper core/10      incredibly simple not a big fan of the skirt color black would look better change the inside shirt to something more interesting or generally brighter  6/10      not feeling the inside shirt i think the fit is a little off maybe get a larger one also the zipper pocket is kinda weird to look at great colors tho  6/10    also numerical ratings without reasoning is a fucking meme
  is the band t shirt too much i thought so just wanted to check here
  honestly the outfit isnt horrible its just held together badly button your sleeves or commit to folding them up you seem like a pretty chonky guy so some better fitting pants not skinny would work much better try to minimize the bagginess on the bottm
first time posting here effay am from lit what can i do better 22 yo there                those fits are pretty nice
  heh cant say much im always a newfag on /fa/ since although i have been lurking it since around 2016 its always been casually touristlike never post fits here too and dont really put any effort into being /fa/ but i really enjoy some threads like waywt and milspo its nice to find some outfits like yours
  looks pretty darn good only thing is you kind of have a bowl cut
  bitches love em  thats because you attract girls instead of women
  i really love this hi
  shits too dark can see anything
pants gotta matching red snake painted on the back but hard to include in pic

  this is the only good recurring poster in these threads  hes right none of the posts are interested in fashion only clothes
  this is very good  as well as the only fashion post itt  but seems completely unsuited for the environment in which you are in
  tripfags  sorry but this isnt /fa/ golden years  tripfags are just attention seekers looking to play out their own deluded ego on anon board
  what
  lose weight get better fitting jeans stick to neutral or dark color shirts
  i appreciate you
  thats thats what im saying retard
  i want to date your hands
  you know what i appreciate the dedication here gj anon
  slimmer pants that arent so baggy a black shirt that matches the pants would look alot better here
  best itt  this thread is pretty bad yo
  ids i like
  how was he hard to understand there is a difference between fashion and putting on clothes from walmart
  averagecore no fashion to be seen    i absolutely despise slav bydlocore    too little going on besides basic ass streetwear    good but youre not the one to talk when it comes to recycling ideas    basic ass streetwear     top has potential bottom shoes and pants are just bad    im getting sadboi/softboi vibes and actually like it somewhat    very basic but nothing offensively bad at least  unlike most stuff itt    i dont get this style/10    theres some good idea but its not wellexecuted yet    i like slp unlike most so upvoted    decent military fit but then im not a fan of military    pretty okay college studentcore    no just  doesnt work in this combination    mallcore shirt ruins an otherwise normal fit    layer more on top its too bottomheavy right now    does absolutely nothing npccore    i fukken hate pure streetwear    you have some idea of what youre doing but some punch is missing    normal aside the jacket nothing tells me anything    kinda interesting but not a fan of shiny metal on men    get fitting pants and then come again    lazy/chillcore its aight for what it is
which look is better/less awful /fa/                nice
long down coats arent always effay but its getting cold finally    both pretty bad desu but gun to head left    very fucking cool this is how all black should be done    i hate this term but dressed by the internet seems to apply here    cant see too much but losing a tiny bit of weight would help a lot maybe just 5 lbs also i like the haircut gives you character    lose weight and fit would be better but sitll pretty basic fuccboi look    lose weight and change your haircut either trim the sides for a fade/undercut or grow it out    oh manthose jeans look awful on you and the shirt is middle school    like it but i would get a bigger shirt to balance out the bottom heavy look you have here
  sweet ass shoes man
  i am a victim of clown shoe syndrome a lot of the time since my feet are big while im on the thinner side but i thought it didnt look quite so obvious there also maybe a dig at my hair as im growing it out
  id on boots
  solid fit but please burn these shoes with one of your lasers
  clown shoe syndrome  leather soles are your friend
  thanks anon ill look into them hopefully not too pricey
  lmao dont mean to offend but you look way too tryhard wearing that in that age unless you are going to a specific occasion that requires it the outfit by itself the left one at least doesnt look bad but what are you the ceo of a company at 16 years old  looking like a miniature of a man
  hopefully not too pricey  hopefully your definition of pricey isnt too strict  well made shoes will never be cheap  everything under 100 is trash  2300 is the sweet spot
  im usuallt a thrifter but shoe are something i dont mind spending more money on so your range is perfect any leather sole shoes you can recommend appreciate it bro
  try a better quality shirt
  any leather sole shoes you can recommend  personally im a fan of loake  but if you are a burger allen edmonds is probably the most popular choice
  thought i saw you in mckeldin the other day
  how do i style my hair like knochs
  oh shit maybe i go to umd lol

i saw a japanese guy wearing these leather boots at the airport they look like a onepiece upper at the toe they have a yellow line running through the edge of the sole and a yellow dot at the heel any idea what these are
  some generic department store boot they arent some amazing grail because a japanese person was wearing them you fucking dork
  i think op is interested because wholecut boots arent at all common
  what department store
  op here yes the onepiece upper plus the leather and the overall construction looked high quality
  also im not 100 sure he was japanese

jesus the waywt and cop threads are the most boring shit why do you all come onto a fashion board when you all dress like normies anyway all underage who cant even afford allsaints pathetic at least we have a cape thread up i hope this board wasnt always dogshit
this lemaire shirt pretty basic but it fills a gap i had in my wardrobe comfy af     super nice cop what do you think of the fit i really cant decide if im an m or an l in these things    i kind of like it i think looks like itd be good for shooting    very nice

was this an awful decision
posting a string of recent cops
  basically went on a chav shopping spree
not big on the text but had to
  i always get aphex twin and atlas plug confused lmao fuck me
air max 95 string total orange
              fucking awful stuff and thats coming from a guy who owns 4 ellesse tracksuits    looks great
uniqlo overcoat it has unlined shoulders so it looks p casual and chill closes alternative i found was our legacy so uniqlo had to do feels decent though
  did you wipe your ass with your windbreaker
my gf unboxing it for me  its black sweater
  wow youre so enlightened for impulse buying a shitty cardigan from a brand that only teenagers or 30 year old weebs like
  dogshit uniqlos quality is absolutely trash youd probably find better quality at thrift stores
  i have the same coat and its great
  quality is a meme
    buying a thin bathroom mat coat    were better than this cmon
  not them but i also have one of the coats and i love it it fits really big though so i had to size down 2 sizes
  i agree i bought 34 pieces at uniqlo when i was in france and they did not last long but looked very good for the price
  oh yeah lets see your ellesse pieces and see how great they are    the le coq sportif trackie feels so comfy and actually doesnt fit as slim as yoox said it would its made of fleece instead of poly so its mad comfy in colder weather as well
  w3cop
  whats wrong with metal snap buttons
  i have a girlfriend
  the brand is eponymous to the caption on the piece
              anon why
  suck my dick you stupid faggot not everyone has to have the same tastes as you
i got this for 50 full leather although it was probably made in some sweat shop
    nice
    v nice personally copped the come to daddy promo tee from that merch drop
  sweater
  oof 10/10
i got this just to entertain my 2000s eurotrashcore side which still pops out from time to time with my ripped dg jeans and racing sneakers
  when is 3 coming out gaben
leather waistbag for like 12
  (((
  to 
  this is the fashion board faggot not the clothing board
its pretty basic but i cannot think of anything more beautiful than a black wool/cashmere chesterfield
  you sure thats leather
  the lining is not white though its offwhite yellowish if you look at the fit video its even more noticeable
this but in a super limited navy colour  this whole fucking brand is regurgitated tumblr core shit at a high price i absolutely hate the kid designing it but if ima talk shit i dont want folks saying its cause i cant afford it but the fit is immaculate true oversized  boxy fit
    they look good on foot
    fashion victim
despite /fa/ telling me not to
what colors pair well with this would stonewash jeans and white sneakers work
not super excited but whatev
  why didnt you just buy a blank reverse weave hoodie if you dont like the design that much are you rarted
  w2c
copped for 130 each cant wait to be told how i wanted my money 
  its a plain black topcoat anon go to literally any menswear store
  wasted
  if youre the guy that copped all that i have to sat i rate your style and thats exactly how i want to dress some people can just pull it off
some more boujee cosplay ya diiig     a few champion sweats for lounging
shame theyre a bit long so ill lose some of that bottom detail
  why is diesel so expensive though how are they able to survive i mean i havent seen anyone wearing diesel for only god knows how long who buys diesel nowadays especially for those prices
  they still make good jeans
  isnt it like 666 degress in aus right now
  yeah mate its summer right now gonna wear it later
  well it looks comfy hope you like it
  i like it can you post a pic of how it looks on you
nothing too special but im excited
recent breakup and ive been fucking spending too much
  and on the wrong shit
  ththanks yyou too
  it could be faux but idc
left may be a bit hard to pull off but im feeling extravagant lately
just got them    you cant make fun of them because theyre puma
  im in new york and i see fucking everybody wearing diesel same goes for when i travel to paris i always thought it was just cheaper in europe until i realized eurofags spend more on clothing on average      also i second that their jeans have held up better than even some of my armani jeans plus their fits are pretty great despite having a button fly their jeans dont stretch out around the crotch area and look funny after 1015 wears like other brands
  im a portly surly italian guy so im sure european sportswear looks better on me than some twinky asian or nordic dude
  not surly i mean gruff and brutish nobody would guess im actually a stockbroker since i pretty much talk like sylvester stallone
                    samefag here got this shirt earlier today figured id get a good deal at 75
  you dont have to have the same taste as me that shit is ugly and cheap looking you can go for the chav look without actually going full chav
  yes look like childrens shoes
  what is the point of this the whole shoe looks like shit    who do you feel the need to post your boring jacket    rate my boring shirt    this is actually ok

  fr w2c been looking for that right gits shirt forever
lifelet here who has tried getting into fashion a few months ago and i just learned of what fast fashion is    bruh my wardrobe is 90 brands like hm and uniqlo just fucking end me
  dont worry about it thats a fine place to start you dont want to drop a shit ton of money on stuff youre going to resell at a loss anyway like me if you want to start upgrading your wardrobe do so slowly only buy what is a clear yes to you if there is any doubt or waffling skip it plan out what kind of overall wardrobe or look you want and buy pieces that will fit together for the long term    t wasted more money than i care to say on random hype garbage
thats a decent baseline now just get interesting pieces as you see them no sweat
      thanks guys i appreciate the comments going to try to make my wardrobe more unique as time passes now
  im sorry man but you have yet again exposed yourself as a lifelet but dont worry youre not actually a lifelet as it seems youre willing to learn and change  /fa/ pushes memes and /fa/ is a very small niche percentage of people interested in fashion and theres a 90 chance that you wont meet someone with tastes similar to /fa/ in real life   not to mention that at this time /fa/ is just a bunch of insecure teenage twinks   there is absolutely nothing wrong with wearing basic stuff from hm and uniqlo like jeans flannel shirts plain t shirts etc  sure there are better option out there but for someone that isnt that rich this will do uniqlo desu is pretty high quality material wise hm can be sometimes shitty but its still alright  think of it like drinking some regular beer and a bunch of hipstery faggots telling you youre drinking fast alcohol and that you should only drink the specific craft ipas they like   at the end of the day your beer is still quite alright and the absolute majority of people wont mind it     also if youre going to have fashion as a serious interest of yours try not to follow a fucking hivemind even if it isnt something as autistic as /fa/
    i disagree with /fa/ on quite a lot of things but i think fast fashion is one of the more universally disliked things at least from my exposure to it recently     not saying i will never buy a basic white tshirt from asos again but i think diversifying my wardrobe when it comes to any standout clothing is a good thing youre not incorrect though
  yes but fast fashion is one thing buying stuff from hm and uniqlo and similar brands doesnt equate to that  of course fast fashion can and does sometimes look really awfully but at times its just plain okay which is always a load better than being an insecure 20 year old college student trying to dress sleazecore   i hope youre getting what im pointing out   diversifying your wardrobe is always great but following /fa/ advice on things is never great  theres some nice inspo from time to time and thats pretty much all of the productive side of this board
have you ever had someone unironically just fucking laugh at your face for wearing something     i wore a blue adidas sweater once at work and two softboys literally braced themselves into themselves to contain their laughter    literally just a regular sweatshirt/sweater thing looked fine
  have you ever had someone unironically just fucking laugh at your face for wearing something  no but ive gotten staresif you werent wearing anything outlandish then there is a possibility they werent laugh at your outfit but if you were acting weirdi could see it
i seriously doubt those kids were laughing at you but ive never been laughed at for wearing anything before i would never wear something thats worth laughing at in the first place i have definitely gotten some looks before for wearing some pretty dark shit
  this is the same sweater i was wearing  whats happened are basedbeans not into athletic wear these guys are straight up onions boys like the beanie wearing bad beard genetics ugly vintage clothes type
      no everyone just ignores me
  
  they probably were laughing because omg its just like the slav memes dude lole hehe xddd  but yeah this has only happened to me once and it came from a literal smackhead pale skellytier dude he saw my outfit burst out laughing and was like what are you wearing  i was literally wearing a black leather jacket black shorts with stockings boots and a scarf it was winter im a grill btw  it still confuses me to this day but it really pissed me off at the time
  shit sucks dont feel comfortable wearing shit because of it the slav meme thing actually makes sense though was kind of going for that look with the short distressed hair thing doesnt really look bad its not like i was cosplaying or anything its always the thin nu male femme pale white guys that do shit like this shit is fucking gay
  yes  when i wore my cowboy hat to school as a child
  i got laughed at for trimming my beard into a mustache  i promptly went home and shaved it
yea i wore black sketchers snd got bullied for it snd my mom bullies me for wearing the clothes i wear
  what was he even making fun of that sounds like a normal outfit
i got bullied for wearing ugly brown boots with black pants on 4chan    still recovering
  i went to a black high school and a kid came to school with like a phat farm or baby farm shirt that was wayyy to big for him and after people made fun of him ive never seen someone so upset about their choice of clothes
  is this bait he was laughing at you wearing shorts in winter but then deciding you need a scarf to stay warm
  jokes on them phat farm is based
not actually bullied but someone irl called this shirt tasteless and so i never wore it again
no but if happens i wouldnt care    8k worth of clothes on me   caring what someone who shops at walmart thinks
  lol i saw that thread i apologize anon pretty sure it was just some newfag who did not recognize those god tier brogues youve got there
  no because i dress nonretardedly  well to be completely honest last year of high school is when i started getting a personality which is earlier than most and started getting my own style and i liked ivy and british country style clothing in the beginning people tought it was weird i was tucking in my shirt and i was literally ths only guy in school not wearing sneakers
  i wear a black leather shirt with no undershirt beneath it sometimes once there was a group of guys laughing at me i obviously heard it and turned to see smiling and more giggles
  have you ever had someone unironically just fucking laugh at your face for wearing something  my sister told me my shirt made me look gay she bought me that shirt never had to deal with asshole family trying to buy me clothes as presents ever again
  careful who you call a smackhead pale skellytier dude
  didnt you know thots cant feel cold
  they werent laughing at your clothes
  oh fuck
yes all the time when i was kid i come from very poor family so i used to wear old oversized shit girls bullied mercilessly for it used to put images of me on their social sites and tried to ostracize me from the little friends i had i hope those cunts will hang one day meanwhile now they act like nothing ever happenned
  that sucks man im really sorry have a happy scorpion who loves and cares about u
  black shorts  in winter   kek stop felling for memes and staring caring about your health roast
  yup i wore yellow vans and a 12 year old kid said what are those and laughed at me
  nice boots i need some new shoes mine are worn out what brand are those boots
  holy shit anon i hope youre okay now   i wish some fashionable le chad assholes ruin their lives
  actually yea i dont think they meant to actually hurt my feelings but they did  i wore boys basketball shorts because girls shorts go too high and arent comfortable they said i looked like a little nigga im white nigga meaning male poking at a deep insecurity i dont wear shorts anymore
before high school i used to wear almost exclusively cheap blue trucker jacket that was too big dark tshirts and cheap blue jeans in the winter also fleece jacket i was saying shit like  lol giving a fuck about fashion im too smart to care about such unimportant things etc etc  i was also extremely autistic that time which meant that id get laughed at occasionally but i was so based in my mindset that i literally have zero fucks and continued to wear the same shit every day
  when i got into fashion and tried new styles around the time i started browsing /fa/ my mum would call me gay and it made me v insecure _
  my mum would call me gay  lel
  dont laugh
  lol sorry the thought of unironically being called gay for attempting fashion by your mum cracks me up
not laughed in my face but a lot of guys have expressed their confusion why i dont wear super normie clothes i wear a lot of dresses and like cute stuff but also milsurp and etc not too weird on the internet but irl it disturbs some guys girls usually dont comment much maybe think something is cute or interesting or just are not into my clothes but easily recognize what i like guys more often have no idea what to think    i was bullied a bit for wearing thrift store clothes as a kid one girl used a great one on me in 2nd grade whered you get those pants baggy world yes
i have the comfiest black turtleneck sweater possible and people usually ask if im feeling alright implying that one would only wear such a thing if they had cold  there was this one person who implied nobody would wear something like that srsly  and i have a running joke with a buddy of mine where i try to dress like steve jobs whenever i wear it    otherwise no i dress pretty basic
i went from dressing like absolute shit  baggy dirty mismatched clothes sometimes with holes in them  to going more business casual some years ago so i guess my friends kinda laughed at it at first just because it was out of character    its just how i dress now everyones used to it
  normies get out
  they probably thought you were about to squat down and pull a bottle of vodka out of your ass
  they prolly stil look better in 100  clothes than u in 8k
  based and redpilled
used to get a couple of laughs wearing these but after a while people warmed up to them
no one ever laughed at what i was wearing but i also dont participate in the waywt threads
  if youre not wearing it can i have it
  npt laughing but ive had some comments made by friends not saying it looks bad but that it looks weird but what can you expect from dudes that shop at walmart and girls that think uo is peak fashion
wore some chubbies before short shorts     and a bunch of guys called me a faggot while they were walking behind me 
i get an equal amount of compliments and insults when wearing a full tracksuit
  hey i bet youre really cool and i hope you live a fulfilling life
  not so much for wearing something but im blond and i used to have long wavy hair and the pharmacist i robbed at knife point called me goldilocks in court fucking goldilocks in court on public record i started wearing my hair short after that and im glad no one in jail ever heard about it or else i would have been made fun of for my entire sentence
  lmao i was a bit younger but now that i think about it it was pretty retarded  the tights kept me warm tho i guess i didnt want to just be walking around in leggings with nothing covering my arse u no
  the pharmacist i robbed at knife point called me goldilocks in court  what a chad holy shit
  i hated that nickname and im glad it never caught on i would have never heard the end of it
    how did a prettyboy like you even end up robbing a man anyway
  where was this and where do you work i wear these types of jackets everyday and theyre top gear
  the pharmacy i took at knife point sold things like oxycontinwhich i took a lot of i was planning on oding on it to kill myself after having a few days of fun but the cops caught me before i managed to do so so now im still alive and still in a living hell except now i also have a criminal record
  you stole those from a bowling alley fucking thief
  didnt mean to post a pic pls disregard that it is not me
when i was 16 or 17 i wore an old carhartt duck hat to the mall for some reason and some black guy laughed at me for it    it was a funny looking hat so i didnt sweat it
    this  i at one point was wearing an adidas hoodie and this longhaired faggot goes up to me and goes it makes sence youre russian xd  i wanted to beat the shit out of that faggot so hard but i had to restrain myself because those faggots nearly got me labeled as a school shooter and i was nearly kicked out of school all because of a plastic knife
my friend and i got made fun of for wearing skinny jeans at the mall by a group of black dudes back in like 07 or 08 only a few years later jerking became popular and black dudes were wearing skinny jeans 100x tighter than what we wore when we were wannabe scene kids
  blacks are always the first to jump on hypetrains
  everything i ever got made fun of for doing or wearing by black guys they jumped on years later after a rapper did it
  mum would call me gay  sounds like a piece of shit    mostly roasted about footwear being inappropriate for the setting suede vans or chad neon running shoes for manual labor jobs white superstars with a suit jacket shirt and pants at a wedding    in my defense at the latter the couple requested guests not to be too formal probably looked more ready for a nice party but isnt that what a wedding is a celerbration i was the youngest attendee and desu i dont give a fuck i look great how the hell do you wear a full suit and tie and not be formal id say everyone else disregarded their request or misunderstood not like i showed up in a tshirt and jeans
i forgot i had my heart shades on and i walked into a nongay bar some chads laughed but chicks were digging it so idk
i once wore carpenter pants got laughed at but im over it haha
  i think the world probably sees you a lot differently than you think it does
  haha good thing it wasnt internalized and severely traumatic haha
  its a nice shirt anon 
  if you arent slav or turkish get outta that shit brother thats the kind of clothing i expect in a liveleak vid
  what do you mean
  for anyone thats saying no because im not stupid you probably dress fuckin boring fashion is shit if you arent taking risks its not hard to just copy a look youve seen 14 thousand fuckin times boys sure youll fit in but i dont think fitting in with everyone else counts as fashion
people laughed at my bape in high school
  about three pharmacist has called me miss so far whats with them being unable to distinguish sexes
  the gotten some looks for some pretty dark shit makes you seem pretty edgy senpai i could be wrong but if i had to wager id bet the people giving you looks werent thinking what you thought they were maybe you really are a spooky goth boi out here scaring civilians with your dark shit but the way you described it doesnt seem like it
  it looks good there was a meme some years ago that all floral shirts are tasteless
  two days ago i was in a walmart and a group of nogs walked by and giggled at me for wearing cowboy boots    pic related    i also get constantly teased by my normie friends for dressing like a terrorist/school shooter/etc because i wear a lot of black with boots
  take off your hat your hair looks swell
  my people have very famous live leak videos anon    call center
yes it was a poncho sweater and i got some pretty nasty looks that day never wore it again
you shouldve seen what this kid zakaria aouragh was wearing  pure jokes loool
  still relevant
holy shit im getting too old for this board  90 of you faggots are cringy teenagers
  ive never actually been laughed at but what eventually led to me selling my entire rick owens collection along with some julius boris etc was the amount of random hypebeasts coming up to me in the street and either telling me my stuff was fake or asking to take pictures of me after about 5 years of wearing traditional rick/darkwear i had been debating branching into new territory but the one incident that made me finally snap and liquidate it all was when i was in chinatown with my gf and a group of asians started filming me and talking between themselves about how they were going to expose me for wearing fake rick i dont know if they thought i didnt notice them or if they just didnt care but we just kept walking until they finally got bored and walked away after about 20 minutes that video is probably online somewhere gotta love living in the 21st century
  cropped pants
  similar story i stopped wearing ricks because of these damn chink eyes keep getting stunned and paralyzed when they see me    still wear my rick bomber only because its comfy but thats it
  not really but my mom dad and brother sometimes make fun of me and say i look gay
  you sound exactly like me lmao i was kind of known as wearing t0tally out there clothes when i was younger granted a lot of my fits were pretty edgy and cringe because preteen anyway i remember one day in like 7th grade i wore this dress to school i know a dress like wtf right and got so many dirty looks for it i passed these two girls in the hallway and one must have been talking serious shit and her friend goes but i thought you liked dresses and the first girl said yeah but not like that kek
  vintage  dont lump people who like old shit together with soi fags they are not one and the same
  nope not even when i wore shorts with long johns and flannel shirts i got a few looks though
  maybe because that is what you look like

  got made fun of by some assholes once for wearing a deep v neck lmao shouldnt have wore a deep v neck obviously but fuck them  one time some girl asked me why i was wearing skinny jeans  got made fun of for wearing ugly high tops  fuck i hated high school but my sense of style in early high school was even worse
  if you can make a woman laugh you can make her do anything
  keep it up eventually you could be known as double denim dave
  so you where cosplaying as a slave spinelli
  no but i dyed the tips in my hair before a school trip and girl i was head over heels for at that time laughed in my face felt bad af man    ended up fucking two sluts at disney world in one of the shut down rides came thrice and they both were tight  then i didnt care lol

  only when they look like this with the clips the kind with buttons is the only way to avoid looking like a complete fag

yes a dark brown fleece pullover    they called me the bear man
  oh fuck i forgot i was tripfagging no im a tranny attention whore
  this has only happened when im wearing my short shorts once directly some girl shouted something sarcastic about them i dont remember what it was and once indirectly some couple walked by and i heard the girl jokingly say to the guy we need to get you some shorts like that and the guy just let out a long noooooooo and they both laughed
  knowing i look unironically better than you when all my clothing is from thrift stores    heh
  i wore a ww2 ike jacket to school once in 7th grade

only once back in high school when i wore an oversizer la noire tshirt and got called gay for it by a hipster
  i was more confused by what he meant than anything but he got a terrible haircut later on and i roasted him for it in art class
not really any laughing but just criticisms wore autism velcro shoes in 6th grade and my brother mentioned it so i ditched those then i got some autism laced shoes from costco in 7th grade some guy in class just straight up told me his grandpa wears those not even in a mean waygood lookin out timmy from that point on i just wore nothing but vans for a decade  i was also a poorfag so i had like 5 or less shirts and 2 hoodies and some people would mention if that was my favorite shirt or hoodie     in high school some girl pointed out my plaid cargo shorts which i still cringe thinking about clashed with my striped hoodie i also used to be real big on being matchy matchy in the worst colors and my now best friend pointed this out to me i honestly was hardly a step above autismcore since i didnt wear metal/gaming/anime tees glad i finally started at least dressing like a normie my senior year it also feels good getting compliments on my shirts semifrequently now
  anon hate to break it to you son but i get why they laughed
when i wore suede boat shoes
  tuck it in and roll the sleeves probably wear it with light coloured slim fit trousers
  implying i am asian at at all  the absolute state of mongrel cucki bet you are race obsessed amerimuttpathetic
  literally everyone and their dad wears this type of addidos sweater i know it probably looks pretty shit on me but i dont fucking know anymore
  where do you live that selfrespecting employed men wear anything adidas other than sportswear
  no because people in real life generally arent dickheads and dont really notice/care if you wear something stupid    i wonder how many selfimage complexes /fa/ has given people
i was walking to a barber when i was 13 and had a quite tight topman white shirt on with a white topman jacket over it it rained and the shirt stuck to my skin and to but it pluntly i had a terrible body and it was near see through and 2 guys who werent even chads laughed and pointed and said look at the shirt  i didnt go to the barbers i walked back home and went to bed
  sauce on pic    also whats wrong with desert boots
  also whats wrong with desert boots  nothing theyre the most inoffensive unnoteworthy leather shoe you can wear
  its nice id wear it ironically
where have all the techwear threads gone  also what are the mask/neck thing i am always seeing called
dudes legs look like he lives on a horse
they went to their discord echo chamber  neck gaiter
  thanks  have you a link to the discord by chance
reddit is better for techwear so we dont bother coming here anymore
i think the style kinda died off since its so associated with antifa dressing like that is a liabilityagree or disagree with them looking like one of them is taking a risk
do these fit the techware aesthetic
  not perfectly but theyd do
  just add bursts of color but i guess that kinda defeats the purpose doesnt it
  yep they killed the aesthetic for sure
  just dont wear all black the tacticool fags over on /out/ and /k/ basically dress very similarly without the tryhard neck gaiter as buff but they prefer earthen colors due to camofaggotry which in my opinion looks better they also have superior taste in footwear if youre going to larp as a civilian combatant then might as well wear tactical boots aka overdesigned but turbo comfy hiking boots
you cant rock techwear without spending thousands of dollars and having the right face and body type
  this guy is right and i hate tacticool
  aw thanks anon  t /k/ommando
big beat music playing in the background
  this is the ideal techwear bodytype    you may not like it but this is what peak performance looks like
remember when beards were masculine and people who sported beards were constantly harping on how manly and superior they were i remember
thanks to every bearded masculine homo bragging about how manly and cool beards were everybody grew them way to ruin them fuck heads

hi /fa/    id like your advice to start putting together solutions for the various aspects of our appearance im surprised we dont already have a general for this    please contribute in any way you think is helpful likewise post areas youd like opinions on
  anyway here are my problem areas as best i can see    skin very pale fairly large pores  hair very basic haircut at the moment undercut thats slightly longer on top starting to see receding/thinning widows peak style  jawline i feel like it wasnt always the case but my jaw is looking softer and more pudgy i dont know if this is a fat  thing or if my shitty posture is contributing  teeth not disgusting but theyve never been movie star white and id like to know if this is possible  body total skinnyfat so im going to start with a cardio workout to lose some of the fat and then start lifting no idea what sort of regime i should be doing to look good though lots of conflicting info on /fit/
how important is perfect skin     i used to have really bad acne when i was a teenager and still have some scars and general bad complexion from that period of time i dont really have any zits anymore but hyperpigmentation etc
  lift first
  i dont think perfect is necessary  things like wrinkles dont stop you from being attractive but i think blotchy or uneven skin tone are really damaging to your appearance    are you taking any multivitamins or tailoring your diet to help what about dermarolling you must exfoliate      lift and then cardio for weight loss or just lift and forget about cardio alone
  i eat a pretty wide variety of veggies and take zincvit d    my skin is dry af because accutane fucked me up cant do too much exfoliates or laser treatments i cleanse at evening and use moisturiser twice a day
  skin betacarotene will fix paleness its natural bioavailability is abundant within vegetables this is my skin health focused shake water ice berries antioxidant rich carrots beta carotene source and a drizzle of olive oil  molecular lipid binding agent for beta carotene blend in blender done beta carotene has been proven to warmin skin tones regardless of sun exposure in countless studies     melanotan 2 or tanning injections can be purchased online great tan with no sun needed but darkens moles hairs etc use at your own discretion also the nasal spray form isnt useful stick to injections     natural sun tanning wear sun screen ages skin time consuming but its free and provides vit d3 and sun light is a proven anti depressant     tanning beds not a bad idea but costly and ages skin    hair undercuts are fine if you dont like the cut or find it boring change it up to something that may suit you better     hair loss i dont know much about look into finnistside     jawline cut body fat asap fatass mew correct tongue posture chew wadded up gum to build up the maesster muscles jaw muscles     teeth get them professionally bleached if you want that hollywood smile    body just lift brah my routine is currently chest and tricep bicep and back shoulders and legs try that out at least 45 days a week
what is the male equivalent of the basic bitch
  your dad
the i love it when guys dress like this guy
slim fit
  take that back dumb cunt he could beat the shit out of your dad you little faggot
  my dad unironically served in military and can bench press 270 pounds he could kill both of your dads with his bare hands
  its called the basic bro
  i was going to say workwear but then i realized this is the correct answer pic related  why are normies always 5 years behind on trends
designer sneakers   skintight legging jeans  zara jacket thats a ripoff from something trendy right now  undercut
this    just like the basic bitch he is considered welldressed by most normies
  you need to swallow the aesthetics pill and realize that a fit physique does more for the appearance than clothing ever will     thats why normies think this looks good    now if youre fit and well dressed youll be a god but if youre fit alone you can get away with wearing anything
  then swallow the blackpill and realise that the size and shape of your bones does more for your appearance than physique or clothing ever will
  im just big boned  fucking lmao
  i think youre missing the point  if youre a manlet with a gay alien skull theres no amount of lifting or fashion that will ever make you look good
  who who unironically use terms like black pill and red pill are resentful about a high school crush  change my mind
  people think it looks good because people have bad taste taste is one of the greatest dividers that any society has even more than wealth anyone who actually cares about or wants validation from people with bad taste are just sad
  t bluepilled
  hiw is this related to fashion
  depends where you live i live in paris and here it would be a sandish wool coat with blue or black semislim pants  stan smith for the youth or derby for those older
  im sorry that kate didnt go to the prom dance with you but you have to let go of past grudges anon
  he didnt take the brainpill
  here in germany the classic coat  sneaker combo is literally called parisian chic so you have a point
  now if youre fit and well dressed youll be a god but if youre fit alone you can get away with wearing anything  yes but normies unironically think this guy is a god
  lifting will make you look better so theresno reason not to do it
  but normies are also disgusting and not who you want to attract
  very cool
  s e e t h i n g
  how do you know that
  these shoes
  its called the basic bro  
    i love you gals and guys
  this look good naked first     fit  tattoos if desired  hair dialed     then you can wear anything and look great
  nice flex faggot
  ha thats funny though speaking of it i dont see many stan smith around now for the better imo

  i need the original of this pic without the adidas logo
  i could only find a much lower quality version without the logo
  i appreciate the help anon i want to put the originals logo on it and make a tshirt
  found a higher res one with the help of that pic thanks have another you
    4 da yous
  i was thinking the linear logo not the stacked one but it looks really good placed on that wall like that
  forgot pic
  link me and say where you want it  ill save you the work
  heres the higher res   pic related is what i was thinking but with the linear logo adidas trefoil i cant find a clean pic of the linear logo
  i like where the word adidas is in that pic maybe you could place it a tiny bit to the left and place the trefoil on the wall like you did in the one here
  i couldnt find one either so i just cut and rearranged
  black one too just in case if you want me to move it around or space it out more i can
    very nice maybe a tiny bit smaller maybe have the trefoil the same size and place like in this pic 
  i love you no homo
  bigger space between the text and trefoil in this one so its centered relative to the guys
  luv u bb
  could i also get this one in black
  yeah

  that is the terrorwave

not really terror more like riotcore but still i think goggles might be the big thing this winter
    sportswear brands tend to vary per region is extremely popular on both sides of any irregular/asymetrical conflict    pic related  look at these forces totally not backed by any government tier operators
    i always thought it was interesting how similar the aesthetic often is between counterterror units and the terrorists they operate against
rate my dads old nato winter jacket  if it ever hits 20c here ill definetely be wearing it
  jesus christ dual mags and gas mask cosplaying  no shit sherlock its literally a stalker cosplay    oh i bought a real gun so it means im not cosplaying  never said i wasnt but continue    no it means youre even more of an autistic fuck youre literally the guy who buys a katana how do you not have the self awareness to realize that you fucking autistic fuck  good thing i dont actually wear the gasmask and gun combo out in public you sperg     everyone is embarrassed for you every time you pose with your toys  unlike you i dont try to surround myself with people i cant stand to be around and vise versa i invite people into my life who can have fun and dont walk through everyday life with a stick up their ass    brag about how much money you spent on them  i personally didnt spend much because it was a kit built but i can assure you from how you type its too expensive for you specifically
  ok much better i respect you now for cosplaying as your favorite video game character and no clue where you live but where i live literally everyone i know can spend what im guessing is at most 1000 not that anyone would want to
ok guys hear me out what would christmas look like in the year 3000
not much has changed but they live underwater
  faggots sucking each other off openly

  you wish
the virgin slim fit  the chad straight fit
  true
  fatties and manlets making fun of slim fit so fewer people dress in the style and makes it more rare    you fools thats exactly what we want
  if your body is shit theres no clothes that can save you  rick is totally right about the modern couture  you can have both chad and virgin slim and baggy fits
  no you cant because if you work out you no linger fit in slim fit    npc
  t never lifted in his life
  shut up thighlet how much do you measure
  good im ottermode and i hate slim fit the fewer of you i see on the street the better
  hello thighlet please read starting strength    slim fit is an absolute meme on people with real lean muscle
  i dont fit in skinny jeans and i have 8 body fat please lift
  is the guy in frton meant to be the chad lmfao he looks like a complete tool/poser/loser jesus christ
        post bodies   i refuse to believe that you guys are doing anything but larping
im 60 140 lbs and i dont fit in skinny jeans
fuck you all retards mean by not fitting in skinny jeans theres literally thousands of different brands and stretchyness
  i mean anyone can fit in skinny jeans that isnt a tub of lard you just feel like a complete faggot when you do though
  ss  lean muscle
  yeah dude i love my jeans to look like spandex showing off my glutes  retard
  still fits might not look good if u dont wanna be a 2007 chad and show off ur mad gains
are people really this stupid that they dont realize that skinny guys regular fit can be lifters slim fit jesus fucking christ guys who the fuck cares what the writing says if you are not average dude
  transplant losers  get out of seattle we all fucking hate you
threadly reminder that if you choose to call out someone out for being a anythinglet you must be ready to prove that you arent or the automatic assumption is that you yourself are a projecting anythinglet
  nobody cares about how much you lift or how big your muscles are but you you absolute fucking retard
both virgins here
solid discussion on /fa/ for once retarded but solid
  post body retard
  wait you arent actually implying the chubby guy in the foreground looks better than the guy in the background right
  i think he is lmfao  i dont even like skinny fit but the guy in the foreground looks like a complete tool
  retarded input on /fa/ for once stupid but retarded
  i can squat almost 2x my bw for 3x8 and still wear super skinny
  i didnt ask for your favorite drink which is cum
so this is a meme right no one below the age of 40 actually wears straight fit right
  plenty of hipsters in my city wear it and even looser pants
  you know its not 2010 anymore right
  fucking bullshit post glutes faggot
  you manlets realize that people with long legs also have long muscles in their legs which dont balloon out as they get bigger right
  muscle mass doesnt expand muscle size  hmm
  muscles insert into bones tall people have longer tibias than manlets the muscles are therefore genetically longer because they insert in the same areas of the bone but one bone is longer than the other when that muscle grows it looks slimmer than the shorter muscle insertions     pic related for example both have clearly worked on adding mass to their biceps but one of them bulges out less and looks more aesthetic than the other because the muscle insertions are extended farther along the bone
  sorry longer femur not tibia but same thing applies
  which one is supposed to look more aesthetic
    heres a better example you can clearly see although both have grown their muscles one of them looks much bulgier than the other and would have more trouble fitting in slim pants
  to add onto this generally speaking muscle inserts arent directly related to height you can have a short bicep insert while still being taller and vice versa
  this is true of course but longer bones will always have longer muscles regardless of insertions  im simply explaining why taller people are able to wear slim fits even with similar muscle mass
    exactly like whos to say
  literal children
  im tall as well and squat almost as much any one with a decent squat tall or not looks like a massive faggot in skinny jeans
where do you buy shit online besides the op seller
my whole life ive dressed like this  hoodie  plain tshirt  skinny jeans  sneakers  and now im afraid of even slightly changing my style cause i dont want people to notice me too much but i also would like to be prettier am i screwed
go get a livejournal retard
  just make slight changes like investing in larger hoodies baggier clothes  more stylized especially with jeans and go for a new pair of shoes every now and then to expand your collection
  used to be in the same situation if you arent comfortable with anything too drastic at one time just change one thing about your current outfit at a time then slowly fade into another style
  try seeing a psychologist for your autism
  fix your confidence issues first before considering changing your style
  ive been in a similar situation multiple times in my life  what ive learned is to not give a fuck what anyones gonna think if you want to wear something than do it lifes too short to not wear dope shit  and most of the time people waaaaaay over estimate how much other people notice and care about them normally its none    second piece of advice if you have a friend that would grill or make fun of you for wearing what you want to wear cut em out they are toxic and will hold you back
  not your friend      listen to this anon
thats not a style thats a lack of
  try an unstructured jacket instead of the hoodie  then real shoes instead of sneakers  add shirt or sweater instead of plain tshirt  jeans are ok for casual situations  viola  new look and not too expensive either
  lost
be me  visit /fa/ after few year long hiatus  everyone still dresses exactly the same     pic unrelated but if you want to talk about it i dont care
i bet you thought this thread would pop off didnt ya buddy saged just to make sure
any other fashion forums you recommend getting tired of seeing the same fits here all the time
weve reached fashion endgame
  just a circle jerk here and anything different gets roasted thats why itll never change
  way to bump a shit thread
last one at 300

  really like this fit w2c shoes and jacket pls
  jacket and boots are both vintage tommy hilfiger

  ok but the exposed ankle seems silly similar pant shape in a dark navy blue would be cool
   where butthead at
feedback pls    wore this to a gallery opening last night
  nothing is fitting right heregood choice of clothing though just get your shut tailored     the fact that you felt the need to mention that you visited a gallery makes you seem like an egotistical faglord
  /fit/ incel detected
  looks good idk what the other anon is talking about
  thanks anon    mentioned it because i was wondering if it was appropriate for the occasion  i felt underdressed
  what a tease
seinfeld inspired outfit
    thanks for the feedback anon it is in fact a dark navy blue wool trouser with rolled up pant legs i agree unrolled pant legs look better
  looks comfy
  best itt by far    w2c that button up been looking for something exactly like that
  nice blue works well with the military green  brown combo
cringe time dont be rude
  unironically choosing straight fit over slim    legitamitly think this influx is some jewish conspiracy people cant actually think this looks good no offense m8 but the jeans need to go
  i had to throw away all my slim jeans after cycling/squatting due to huge thighs first jeans in like 5 years probably gonna pick up rogue territory or flathead next these are my current cycling pair
  what is a good slim fit jean that sits at the waist and not below the waist   i like levis but im pretty sure they dont make any slim jeans that sit at the waist
  same person here  apparently they did and it was 522s but they became discontinued for some reason
  that was my criteria too and why i was looking at rogue territory sk is their slim fit
    just found these but they are 200 wtf

  the same thing we do every night pinky try to take over the world
payless opens a fake luxury store in los angeles all their stuff relabelled as palessi and marked up as an experiment/joke  all the shoppers raving about how great the shoes are someone paid 873 for a pair of boots  embarrasses the shoppers afterwards by telling them theyre actually from payless and refunds all the money spent by shoppers while also letting them keep the shoes    this says a lot about our society      
its not sad actually rich people learn that the more you pay the better quality it should be but of course this isnt necessary true price is usually a good indicator of quality by paying a premium you are forgoing the need to research and learn true value of product
  believing advertisement constructed by marketing agency is real  says a lot about society
  this they even returned their money and gave them the shoes for free afterwards
  theyd be begging for a lawsuit if they hadnt
  well we do live in one
    quality is a meme
  quality arguement is cope for poorfag who cant justify spending too much on something they loved
  quality is a meme
  mmmuh quality is a buyers remorse cope for poorfags who think theyre rich because they spent their entire minimum wage paycheck on a shitty meme piece on clearance just so they can say they own something from the designer
    quality is a meme posters enjoy taking cocks in the ass
  theyd be begging for a lawsuit if they hadnt  on what grounds could they be sued
  hits too close to home
  jokes on you im just here for the watch threads and dress like an autistic retard
  based and redpilled
  tfw i could open a store with shitty rebranded chinese clothes in the usa and make millions thanks to my italian surname    i need to think about this
  i make a lot of money and buy nice clothes not all clothes have the same quality
  its america people will sue over anything
    this it might take some scam sales of fake great products especially when online shopping but eventually they all learn what quality looks and especially feels like wannabeluxury shoppers who love to brag about the last item they bought from zara need not apply of course see video these fashionistas only went there so they have something to post on their shitty fashion blogs
  
bump
  i think this is more of a testament on how retarded influencers are literally first reaction on seeing that sneaker would be man thats an ugly fucking sneaker like you dont need to be a fucking rocket scientist to recognize a shitty shoe first thing would be the construction ie shitty cloth and second would be the shitty cement construction
boy i cant wait to see all these ecelebs sell outs making fun of people falling for the palessi prank and yet falling for the same tricks payless used for this prank   i cant wait to see h3h3 in one of his podcast  so payless made a prank and opened a fake high end shop called palessi they marked up to 800 800 man and for 20 shoes they are buying these shoes and saying how good these shoes are  this is why american society is going bad we are being tricked by companies they mark up their product price by so much and yet the quality isnt worth the money  how can people be this stupid oh this looks and feels like a high quality product no it doesnt you just paid 800 more than what that product was worth man what a dumbass  next up a word from our sponsors mvmt watch they make high quality watches for a reasonable price they look and feel slick and its the perfect bang for your bucks
  i mean what did you expect you opened the store in los angeles arguably 1 of the most retarded uneducated cities in america everyone there is a mindless sheep that would jump off a cliff if someone told them that doing so was cool i highly doubt this kind of shit would fly if you opened the store in say new york or chicago    inb4 all i see are npcs/we live in a society ive been to la twice and i can legitimately say almost everyone there is ridiculously ignorant naive and stupid not to mention the density of special snowflakes per capita make this place a must avoid for me when looking for a big city to visit
cheap shoes look cheap i doubt that that many people would be fooled
  stop
  me too dd
  this    and most of fashion influencers only wear fashion nova literally anything will feel haute couture compared to what they are used to
  humiliation
  thanks captain what we are arguing is that people are so delusional that they convinced themselves that what they paid will last through their whole life
    there is a sweet spot for quality beyond that you can be paying thousands for a name or unique styling
lmao americants
the only pieces of clothing worth spending hundreds/thousand on are  a leather jacket  leather boots   a full suit    those will last you for years with proper care everything else should be budget items
i have a hard time believing this because payless tends to make some shitass shoes like ive gotten great shoes for 10 before and none of them looked like 
  damn read it in ethans voice
  own something from the designer  loving each and every laugh my dude almost nothing in my wardrobe has a label on it some polos a sweater or two almost all tailoring and the difference in quality is real and palpable
  same bro same
  i thrift fancy shit for myself i can pick out good quality clothing without looking at label most of the time based on feel of the material and how is made high end items are night and day most of the time but buttery brands like loft and banana gap are pretty good quality as well not to say they are cheap new
  nice cope larper
    i wanted to make one with philipe de franco but i saw that he already made a video on the subject at least he was smart enough not to have mvmt sponsor the episode
they just thought they were supposed to shill the product in front of the camera
  13888404    an example of this would be joseph cheaney shoes  they used to make shoes for prada cheaney shoes cost about 400 prada shoes cost twice that
    a lot of designers just relabel heritage brands and mark up the price
  lel please do it
  only designers have quality and if has to cost a fortune  buy by fabrics not by designer you fuck tard
  price is usually a good indicator of quality  spoted the mindless consum cattle     /fa/ggots make me sick
niggas iffy uh blicky got the stiffy uh
how do i achieve this look
ayooo my mans wearing gucci ay bro look at this mans windbreaker      ive also earned the nickname gucci at my school which im not sure is a good thing

sleaze is a state of mind not fashion
  why is your head so big
  please expand i made a thread on /fit/ to try to help me achieve /sleaze mode/ and they said /fa/ often has threads about it
  too much styled hair
you look like a mormon 19 year old trying to act like a normal person on the 1st or second day off since getting shipped out to like arkansas to proselytize
  claiming overstyled hair isnt sleaze
  yes
  cant really pull off /sleaze/ with your facial structure you look like youre a 15 year old zoomer that just entered the internet /sleaze/ has been through some shit and just doesnt give a fuck anymore also face matters if youre just going for style
  lmao your face is fucked
are mullets /sleaze/
  you look dumb as shit
  of course
ive pulled a knife on people before am i sleaze enough or do i have to dress in one of those dumb shirts i see people posting in these threads
  why do so many people have randomly arranged pictures of different sizes on their wall  lmao i dont care about structure and consistency i just put them wherever i want ddd
  soi laurent chinlet

/fa/ beachready sandals/flipflops i dont even know where to look
literally anywhere nobody gives a shit about what you wear to the beach
  fair but if possible id like to have a pair slightly above bullshit quality
  im retarded but what is that shirt
  honestly look at some of the eva birks theyre not made of leather or cork so if you get them wet they wont be fucked super comfortable too i like my pair a lot    its gotcha you fuckin junkyard dog locals only
  is there anything like that nowadays sporty/baggy long sleeves
whats your opinion on this
cultural appropriation
  this but unironically
  all culture is appropriation looks comfy man go for it
  if you buy from a native owned business then cop otherwise no
  tacky only europeans and japanese can into aesthetics
  only europeans and japanese can wear something that isnt remotely related to them  time to end yourself retard
  ugly on clothing native american style although is unique and pretty admire i just dont believe it fits in in our modern age of style you cant wear that without looking like some pothead degenerate
  never been to the southwest
looks like shit
  on par with those filthy hoodies stoners wear
  aztec
trash
i trashed the op in an earlier post but ill add a caveat its okay if you live in new mexico or arizona
  natives are bigger thieves than the kikes  you should never do business with them
  land stolen by kikes  still bigger thieves  whatever you say anon
is it a good idea buying a cazal 7069 for casual everyday wear prescription lenses  i love how i look with them and they are the most comfortable pair of glasses ive ever put on my face
  i love how i look with them and they are the most comfortable pair of glasses ive ever put on my face  so youre happy with the look and you feel they fit you why are you hesitating
  thinking the overwhelming majority of people on /fa/ can make the slightest decision without unanimous approval and validation
  kinda give a rapist glasses vibe
  get those tbone glasses and a hawaii shirt you could get some mad puss if you can pretend to be rich
i need a visvim 20l ballistic nylon backpack but im too poor wheres the /fa/ approved affordable alternative im into workwear japanamericana here washoi washoi
literally just reebok classics with fila logo
  unless you have other fila clothes whats the point
  looks okay but there is nothing special about it
why do sneakerniggers always believe they deserve own threads    everyone else posts in the cop or not thread like a civilized human being only sneakerniggers believe their cause to be special
  i have similar pair they look cool but the build quality isnt great
is this a cute gift for gf
  yea sure  bitches love gifts
god no that ones ugly af
or
it kind of sucks the magic out of a surprise gift but if you want to get her jewelry just take her to the store and be like your limit is xxx   she might enjoy it more brings out that daddys girl in them
  btw dont do this shit if youre going to be cheap know the store know the price ranges save up the dosh dont tell them either just go out with them and stop in to look around and drop it on her it doesnt have to be direct maybe just look around and when she finds something she really loves offer to buy it for her
  jesus this would make me so uncomfortable
the forever 8 thing is really fucking ugly i love the heart but the 8 is so basic
  try something less standard and more personalized
  thats an infinity symbol for some reason chicks fucking love them
  yeah nah i can comfirm that this is cringy af u should inform urself is there anything about her that is special or any key things about here   for example  buy her a hearth shaped amethyst if she is shy because amethyst bring u apparently confidents  there are many stones that explain some certain healing rosequartz is for love  google a bit and explain her why u bought that and tell her in that way that u care its less if that shit really works but more about the thought that u know her    this is an opinion from a chick
  im not op you tard
  and i have no clue why you needed to do chick  also believing in magic stones
  answer why you people like infinity symbols i want to know
  because our bf keep getting us ugly necklaces and we pretend to like them to not hurt their feelings
  wtf then why do i see chicks with it tattood on them  my bf got me a tattoo but its only allowed to be an infinity symbol
  fake till u make it
  good rebuttal
i wish i had a gf
  that made no sense
hi anons recently i noticed in pictures my left eye looks baggy and weird is there a way to fix this it doesnt seem to look that way in the mirror also what tips can you give for taking better pictures
dont worry about it in real life no one really cares about this it only looks noticable because you are looking at a still image focused on your face
  just wear an eye patch chicks dig it my one buddy lost his eye in hockey and wears one instead of his glass eye when ever we go out literally every girl that sees him goes up to talk to him about it
it adds character to your face you should keep it
  fuck your right eye up too
can anybody explain what the fuck scumwave is
a meme
  middle class americans larping as british chavs or eastern european chavs
i love my vans old schools they are cheap comfortable and just work with everything
the virgin 4channer fears the vans old skools
  old schools are bottom boi tier  do you match them with golf wang lmao  just wear black af1s or tns
  i know you cared that your fellow npcs have shit taste but please dont open a thread dedicated to your own kind thank you
vans with laces    no thanks
i like them but every 3rd highschool girl has one and if you walk around wearing them you look generic as hell so i dont wear them often
  black af1  im not a waiter
whats an alternative i wanna get something different than black and white sneakers for once but they need to go with most shit including shorts
  brown leather shoes go with most things but if you like old skools you are probably a zoomer who only wants sneakers  if that is the case  white tennis sneakers cp stan smith c85 etc  vans authentic   574 nbs
  yes even waiters look better than you in your shitty old schools
  picture    black  sneakers  get a load of this guy
  lmao  fell for the white sneaker meme
  black af1  i work at nike and even we know theyre made for crackheads
  kek
  what are some good brown leather shoes also what kind of outfits would go with it that arent too dressy and try hard
  do not wear white sneakers if u have big feets black sneakers are ok vans is crap tho
  most versatile leather shoe in spring/summer/fall is by far the penny loafer can wear it under a normal outfit or under a sportscoat wouldnt wear it under a suit though  camp mocs derby boots etc for when it is snowing  zoomers will recommend shite like chelseas and clarks desert boots but that is ultimate onions
  cool story bro
is it effay to listen to anime openings
of course not anime is lowest common denominator by nature
  weeaboo  /fa/  pick one
  yes only if its jojo ops tho
    more often than not anon is correct if you consider the deluge of hyper commercialized slop weve enjoyed for the past decade almost it dilutes the quality productions to a ever smaller fraction of anime as a whole    personally mszg ops are amazing and everyone knows what a masterpiece bebop is
  anime ops are just songs  is it effay to listen to music  yes but only effay songs some anime ops are effay most are not  jojo is fine
would getting a tapered long fringe undercut as someone whos balding with 21 considered effay im tired of wearing caps or getting haircuts that needs a shitton of styling yet get fucked up at medium wind strenght and as i know a fringe is a good option to cover up the temples     pic related is me can provide pics of my temples balded furter due to minox
if youre already balding you should start lifting and then own up to it once moderately buff also grow a beard what looks good with people who are only starting to bald is indeed pic related but you need the manliness to put it into right contrast
  i cant neither grow my beard nor am i able to lift regulary due to my college schedule    also i was thinking about something more like this
  i think it looks fine in that pic
  thanks but i still need a change
    who have this parka recommend
  looking at this cause long parkas dont look good on me im on the shorter side
  yeah
  hows the fit tell me more
dont own their parka but i havent been disappointed with any of everlanes clothes looks like it will hold up against the cold well personally i really like the fur on parkas so i wouldnt get it for myself
sorry for the low quality pic but does anyone know where the coat is from
do you know who the signer was
  looks like it came from the toilet store
  based idol choice gd baby
  looks balmainy
lol those arent balmain gd wore headtoe saint laurent from 13fw his outfit is exactly same as look 22 from the runway

fuck the aran sweater i ordered on friday fits huge the norwegian one goes well but ill have to pay 21 for the exchange
  plimsoles and tennis shoes are nice for summer theyre absolutely useless in wet weather though
jamiesons shetland sweater just arrived very fond of the fit and quality would recommend
  thank you for european list op ive been looking for one of these for ages
  its being updated by some other guy i hope he posts updates soon      plimsoles  those look like girl sneakers
  where did you order it
    im assuming end since its about the only place where theyre still sold and in stock
do i have the right sort of look to pull of prep my friends say i look too rough for it
    here is an attempt at prep i tried a couple years ago
  i think you look good and can pull off an upper class look
  fade haircut has no place in this style the beard/moustache should be shaven or a bit smaller than that      this is ok      there is also this i dont know how often they restock them  
    thank you friend        yeah i know a fade isnt the right kind of look i usually just cut my hair hairly short and brush it to the side i only have a beard because i have weak bone structures and a baby face so i prefer to keep it short and thick
  i think that how you have it in this pic looks better than     the fade just fits bad with this style longer beard with this last haircut might work
any blogs/inspo for uk based prep/trad also what are chester barrie ocbds like its hard to find a short with a decent collar in the uk without going custom

oh i have this too its the same fit        thank you anon thats very kind i dont often get compliments        my parents arent rich i dont subscribe to the idea of whiteness you do lmao implying theres one broad white race and not just a variety of different cultures and phenotypes but newworlders group them all under white im not an incel or a virgo and you dont make me feel insecure but keep trying fag
  what country are you from
    rekt
    le epic country for kool /fa/ people
  yikes
  some nikes i like the contrasst with the more mensweary parts of my wardrobe
  bosie    just looks generic to me isnt any particular style you could definitely look like a preppy kind of guy might be a funny if you have a massive scouser accent or something tho which part ot the uk you from
  british bloggers    sartorial gent style editor of the chap magazine he wears a lot of prep stuff     best ocbd collar roll in the uk is handsdown drakes if you cant afford it john simons looks pretty reasonable as well the best option ive found is ordering via luxire get a blue oxford with a decent collar length 325 and youre good to go famalam
      forgot to include link
    ah did you detect the subtle shit that indicated that was a spoons    i live in yorkshire i think my friends only said that cuz they associate me with the sort of personality they grew up with the whole autistic wild retard from highschool and college thing
    i want to go back to edinburgh im contemplating living there even such a nice city can anyone redpill me on it
  lol well the girls top was also a dead giveaway that the photo was the uk   yorkshire  lucky i lived in york for five years beautiful county toptier for outdoors
jamiesons    madlads actually went and did it
  bosie  no both from aransweatearmarket the norwegian sweater llbean style in l size fits fine but the aran sweater in l size is just huge i am going to try to shrink it a bit with a washing the quality of both sweaters is fine they are tremendously thick the aran one is soft the other one is not but its probably because is very compacted when the other sweater arrives ill post a photo      ill add it for next thread do you know any other      nice
  where can you buy a flat cap in that style seems different from most
  just seach flatcap on google and get searching eg   although considering thats the prince of wales he probably just had it made for him making it particlarly difficult to find     i personally wouldnt risk a flatcap now anyway too much of a risk of looking like a twat     caseinpoint   although his shiteating smile and eggy body probably isnt doing him any favours either
  hes a jew though its impossible for him to look good    good post though thanks
fawwwkkk just binged
   yikes you got owned lad
    i got pwned ebin style
  i think is a tweed beret with basque or french style

what are some good older/heritage brands that made good duffel/toggle coats    im trying to find some used ones for my broke ass but honestly i have no brand knowledge in this area     bonus points if you can also tell me some good fairisle sweater brands to look for similar to       thanks in advance
  dufflecoats  gloverall camplin original montgomery brooks brothers    fair isle  jamiesons of shetland barbour campbells of beauly michael ross knitwear
  common projects achilles low no other choice
  thanks anon youre a star
does anyone have any recommendations for belts     be it surcingle crossstitched/needlework or other cool designs kinda like 
    luxire looks pretty decent just need to work out about fabric weight and the collar tough to work out between kamakura broke  bespoke or similar but price isnt bad desu
  i wear lowprofile vintage runners onitsuka tigers brooks vanguard or all white leather sneakers
  shame j crew started stocking these jackets seen a zillion people with them on lately
    flat caps are great news boy caps with the panels and button are for women though
  only in very specific contexts like you live in devon if someone is wearing one in london i dont think it works
  i really want to know this too specially european brands because all the cool belt stuff i found is american but many are terribly expensive    smathersbranson   nobbyshop   castaway clothing   yri   vineyard vines   country club prep 
    i would recommend ralph lauren for embroidered belts which can usually picked up relatively cheap on ebay or depop
  any european brand checked ebay and the ones that are cool from rl are all around 5060 and second hand
  fair
    
cold today
just copped this j press off ebay what shirt/pants combo would work with it
  white or light blue shirt for pants i would go with light navy      good outfit
  good but the matching jumper and trousers is a bad idea
i see abercrombie has some fair isles 65 for sweaters with just 30 of wool what a joke
    this barbour and a corduroy brown blazer are top notch
  thanks for warning me my boots are going straight into the bin
these arent the ones i have its just the first picture i could grab what colour outerwear goes with cords of this colour or similar im having a total mind blank
  your collar is so small lmao
        cringe and bluepilled
should i cop dealer boots for mooching about the english countryside or do they look too hideous
  they look pretty bad imo brogue derby boots are best for what you described
  acceptable
    i have a pair of those from barbour that are indeed very nice but they have a flat sole and theyd be ruined if i stepped in a puddle     also its friday  whos shooting or beating this weekend
what watch do you guys own i have an orient bambino v1
  i would get one of the more rugged looking blundstone varients imo
class all day      jack carlson makes tacky clothes because he is afraid of skateboard13yearolds calling him old rowing blazers exists so he can lure gq reporters pretending to be streetwear minorities into his soulless cave at grand and centre and suck them off until they call him innovative
  that blazer seems to fit you big on shoulders
  lol your fit is boring and the colours are not complementary thanks for the brand recommendation though
   the colours are not complementary  i would say the problem there might be the sweater should be dark green navy/blue or a lighter/whiter grey
  that shaggy dog collab with jpress is so bad i really dont know what got into them
  very cookie cutter looks a bit like a uniform youve got all the pieces that classically called prep but it just comes across as a bit cookie cutter maybe your clothes arent high enough quality also im not sure if its the angle but the shirt appears to be too big for your neck
  i should say good effort btw
    looking into these good idea
  make sure you get waterproofed ones
last thread some people were discussing these ll bean handsewn mocs and i forgot to post mine this is after about 2 years of twiceweekly wear on average     they need some tlc but i love the beatup look     im pooping at uni so excuse the absurd framing

  khakis cords flannel slacks jeans
  i mostly use khaki or olive chinos
can i use converse sneaker knockoffs i mean any modern sneakers dont look good with chinos anyway and im not really a fan of my leather shoes since they squeak so much
    anywhere outside the wiki you might recommend some better tight fitting ones
   is this a good store think it fits the style quite well
  tight fitting  never gonna make it
   tight fitting  go for slim if you like thinner stuff but dont go to skinny brooks brothers might have some slim fit stuff for you    i emailed castaway clothing and they are doing now international shipping for some countries might be a good oportunity to get some embroidered belts/pants in the eu for around 6080 you might get some

  bush was a bitch the true leader of the free world was jfk and he died for it

  the true leader of the free world was jfk  he had the chance to make cuba free and he didnt bush would have supported that invasion
  i love this fuckin picture all these monochromesandsolids guys and hes just planted himself there in this insane blazer this is the true essence of prep in one shot hes probably the oldest guy in that pic but he makes the others look like fogies
  it looks good because prep is about not giving a shit while still being appropriately dressed you are right its the essence of prep
  he loved gth stuff specially in socks he even wear bill clinton socks
  weaving your personality into prep is risky but when done correctly it pays off
is this prepapproved 
  i would say no i think that its too saturated the idea of preppy watches might be dw ones which are very simple and ivy style its previous also goes for simple watches take a look

    good night charlie well done anon in fairness it isnt all like that just some deer stalking and most formal driven bird shoots theres a certain carry over to the less formal shoots which is nice though
  i meant to say that i play hockey but that the shoes arent conventionally worn outside the playing field

  could you wear these with a navy/grey suit to a wedding or are they too casual
  barbour fair isle i got this one off of grailed
just picked up a grey herringbone sport coat from brooks brothers today since they were doing 40 off all sport coats has 3/2 roll single vent natural shoulders and i think i got the last 38 regular feels good    theyre also doing all sorta of sales each of the next seven days instore and online i know tuesday will be pants and saturday is ties i forgot the rest of what the store clerk told me though
  youre absolutely right in your criticism of jack carlson and his company i just wish youd posted a better pic to go along with it    your shirt is sized too large in the neck and your pants could be of higher quality and slightly baggier    the biggest problem to me though is that the outfit is bland as others have mentioned which is not a bad thing in and of itself but your face is also utterly boring youre good looking no doubt but all of your features are soft and undefined nothing interesting enough to offset the neutrality of your outfit in my opinion someone who looks like you would do well to incorporate some more daring patterns and textures    try flannel trousers with the blazer or a plaid/herringbone tweed sport coat with the khakis maybe opt for a striped ocbd or a brushed shetland
  could you wear these with a navy/grey suit to a wedding  the copper ones no you couldnt wear those with a navy or grey suit gotta be black with grey or preferably a dark brown with navy my man    or are they too casual  i want to say yes but in this day and age sure you can probably wear double monks to a wedding half the guys there will probably have rented their suits  absolutely dont do it if its the wedding of someone with a clue and standards though
  and your pants could be of higher quality  how do you know they arent high quality

  heres another pic

  go with a suit but i can dress down  ae vernon
cop or not    
  care comes in two ways  polishing and conditioning     depends in part on the kind of leather theyre made out of style of shoe etc but i guess youre talking about not wanting shiny wax polish whats sold as generic shoe polish everywhere trash like kiwi etc  youd be right to avoid that wax polish is for the toes of dress shoes to give them that mirror shine and solely that for the most part avoid kiwi like the plague if youre looking for wax anyway   what you want instead is shoe cream in the same colour as the shoes  some will make leather more shiny than others but they wont be that mirror shine   depends on how much you buff afterwards   creams just for putting the colour back into scuffs etc some will lightly condition but depending on your use case this mild conditioning might not be enough  i prefer to condition shoes separately with dedicated conditioner this shit has no dye like the cream its pure moisturiser for leather because as its dead skin it cant moisturise itself anymore  and moisturise you must to help stage of drying and cracks in the long term in conjunction with the other two pillars of shoe longevity trifecta trees and rotation   depending on what conditioner youll be matt or more satiny shine depends on what kind of leather youre looking to put it on   of you want a more beat up look ie you dont mind discoloured scuffs and shit and just want leather care look to conditioner  creams for colour   wax for the final toe bull shine on dress  be warned that conditioners will most likely darken the leather to some extent depending on which one you use some worse than others in this respect   might lighten again with wear might not mine never have   so beware when you condition light coloured leather like tan and the like   if you want to keep light leathers that exact lightness then one of the mildly conditioning shoe creams is probably enough for normal use
is it becoming more common to not lace boots all the way i got a pair and the laces it came with are so short that theres only about 34 in of lace left when worn and laced fully

hello i really dont know a good style that is coherent with my face and my brother was telling me that i had a kid hair    i was thinking in make it grow grow the facial hair with minoxidil and pick a jhon lennon glasses will this be good  what do you think that can be cool on me  dont want something extravagant but good and attractive to women 
inspo for this
how do i get hair like this minus the color asking unironically
bangs with a hair part
  unironically take the picture to your barber
  this is pretty much my hair just let it grow out take care of it and have wavy thick hair genetics
  i dont have thick hair genetics  then again ive never had long hair
  then its not possible such is the sad life of a haircel
people say i look and dress like harry styles could i get a rating of me and my style thanks
  you look like paul banks
  thats not you you just took a random picture from /r/mfa and posted it here
  sad
  well thats embarrassing
      obvious bait is obvious great detective work
im a tall thin guy guy with unfortunate unmale bone structure since birth elongated body wide hips i used quotes because its fine by me never bothered me personally and im more interested in calisthenics martial arts and bodyweight exercises than the usual bodybuilding for a wide muscular body  despite being interested in normally masculine endeavors and im not gay i still want to dress in a fashionable woman way but still appear distinctively masculine with an emphasis on sports or sportlike attire kinda like a fashionable sports clothes not really used for sports or useful for sports but you get the idea   i workout go to the gym have a normal body but the aesthetic i want to aim for is not for the usual v shape its more for the   shape with wide shoulders and wide hips you feel me  i obviously dont have inspiration and pics but something like pic related could work i think anyway share some insight and inspo please
and fictional inspo sorry couldnt find a closer aesthetic to what i wanted
you seem mentally ill
  why ill never have a typical vshape male physique even with 5 bodyfat and good lifts typical male clothes look misshapen on me and i dont even enjoy that aesthetic dressing like a guy in blue jeans and leather jacket growing a beard all that feels like swimming against the current  why not simply embrace the aesthetic that i would enjoy i need some inspiration though
  long body wont stop you from having good lifts just makes it slightly harder and you wont look as swole as a stubby manlets go to the gym and do your compounds faggot
what are pants that look nice and are flexible tired of ripping the crotch area every time i squat
  how about you wear some pants that arent three sizes too small
  im not op but even loose jeans do that after a while
  i dont know why but its never happened to me and all the jeans i have are midlow quality and pretty slim
you need to wash your jeans desu too stop germs from eating your crouch fabrics    also cheaper jeans are made from slightly more durable type of denim fabric    most durable pants are 100 polyester or nylon pants for mountaineering or 100 polyester adidas track pants
  so is the whole dont wash your denim thing a meme
    you stick them in the freezer to kill the bacteria without ruining the fade in the washing machine
  cool thanks
    dont listen to this goon  just refrain from washing until ur satisfied w the fade and then stick them in a tub with detergent instead of putting them in a washing machine
  wearing jeans whilst squatting  the real concern is ripping them when stepping on your bike
    it takes years to get an acceptable fade
    false most odor causing bacteria found on your jeans still survive at the cold temps in the freezer they dont smell at first because odors and aromas are lessened in strength at colder temps as they warm up on your body the smell will come back instead set your oven to the lowest itll go typically 150175 f and let them sit for 1020 minutes
  how the fuck does this happen i have wore cheap jeans that were 2 sizes too small and they still never tore
  apparently my and ops nasty ass crotch germs can melt denim
people who dont get blowouts obviously dont wear their jeans it takes years of daily use eventually everything blows    why the fuck are you guys buying new jeans if old ones are not even broken yet fuck off
  you need to actually wear and do activities in them   roaming in your local air conditioned shopping mall for 20min once a week doesnt count
  those are clearly worn through crotch germs and not torn mr tough guy
  protip farmers or construction workers doesnt have crouch blowouts by germs while doing their labor because they wash their jeans
  that is bullshit crotch area gets most of the friction when you move around and they will blowout no matter what but you are right that bacteria and dirt break down cotton fibers even faster if you dont wash your jeans
  i have the same problem but purchased a pair of as colour pants and have been good for a year of basically daily wear  
  the seat and knees wear out long before that
  maybe if you are construction worker not if you are regular normie npc
  iron heart
  just noticed a blowout in mine today quickly got some new ones at the dfo nearby to replace them near daily use for about half a year is about all i can expect i suppose
  pants are loose around the waist but right around the thighs and hips squat booty

skincare general    post everything related to skin care itt    wiki  skin care basics  acne treatment    skinacea links  retinoids  sunscreen  ridding dark eye circles    faq  general guide  dark circles  soap ph irritants and synthetic detergents  popping pimples  postinflammatory hyperpigmentation  skin tone and diet  causes of acne
okay so i bought those stridex maximum strength pads last year on june and i started using half of a pad  neutrogena cleanser  toner  moisturiser and i had then got the worst acne i have ever experienced in my life the most noticeable spots were these spots on my right cheek after a few months i changed my skin routine and its has worked very well for my skin problem is these pimples or cysts have been here ever since i havent been to a doctor for it but im contemplating it   i have tried   cetaphil  fineacea  moisturiser  cetaphil  benzac 5  moisturiser  the benzac routine has fixed majority of my acne on my face but these hard bumps on my face that arent painful mind you have never gone away   i attempted to use a clean needle to actually jab one of these hard cyst pimple things and it just bled the bump didnt go down in volume and didnt go any softer   any tips its so bad thankfully i dont see it unless i turn my head
  idk why the quality of my image goes to shit when i upload it but the lumps are 2mms higher than the surface of the skin and are much more red and not pixelated   oh i also change my pillow case every week so i dont think lying on it could be preventing it from healing
scrub/exfoliate skin in shower  feel softer/smoother  but has added more wrinkles     what the heck is going on here
bump
  gotta moisturize too
my face looks better when i do nothing to it at all worst problem was a little bit of dry skin so i added a moisturizer a week ago now i have little pimples everywhere
  youre harshly rubbing your skin in various directions of course thats going to cause wrinkles use a chemical exfoliant like 10 lactic acid    my holy grail recommendations    lactic acid  for brightness wrinkles hydration  chemical exfoliant which unglues the already dead skin cells buy at 90100 and dilute to 10 with water your skin will get rougher for the first couple of weeks before it actually falls off then stay consistently soft and bright after that you need sunscreen if you use this    hyaluronic acid  for hydration  emollient which has a tiny molecular structure  it squeezes between your skin cells and then absorbs up to 1000x its own volume in moisture keeps skin hydrated and plumped up use it under your moisturizer morning and night    nyacinamide  for bright even skintone  antiinflammatory which helps to reduce hyper pigmentation scars and flushing can be used morning and night without photosensitivity    i dont use lactic acid any more because after a year of religious use i dont have any fine lines left and the hyaluronic / niacinamide combo has kept new wrinkles at bay    the hyaluronic acid is also 100 the ingredient that keeps me pimplefree when i dont use it i have really oily skin and break out pretty bad
  maybe its the type/brand of moisturizer
any anons have any experience with this i used it for a couple days and had a really good experience with it i was using it twice daily once in the morning once at night and my face didnt breakout like it usually does i liked it i just want to make sure it wasnt secretly fucking up my skin
  could you tell me what products/brands exactly you use or recommend im aging like crap and im oblivious when it comes to skincare products so i dont really use anything except for an estee lauder moisturizer after showers
cut out dairy and wash your face in shower everyday     moisturize after shower and before bed and in morning if your skin is dry    youll have flawless skin in a week i promise     your welcome
  thanks anon and if this doesnt work ill have to kill you
is this a good sunscreen to use  really having trouble picking one although i know its gonna be trial and error
  im srs just keep it simple     none of that topical product bullshit/creams ect
is shaving skincare i went out and got a double edge razor kit today i tried it out and everything went well for 30 seconds until i got to my neck then it turned into a bloody mess and i stopped so i didnt die of blood loss    are de razors just a meme im not seeing the benefit of this over a gillete mach 3 to be fair i had to use a canned foam cause my tobs hasnt arrived in the mail ill give it another go when i get that but i dont get why everyone like doing this
  yes shaving is skincare    it actually helps remove dead skin cells/top layer on the surface of your skin thats why your skin usually feels much smoother than normal after shaving
does coconut oil actually help with dandruff/seb derm can i rub a little on problem areas of my scalp and be okay for a day between showers
  does this actually work     i cant find the old 10 glycolic lotion i used before so i want to get this but idk if the concentration is too low to actually do anything and its more work than a lotion     do i put sunscreen over it after it dries is there a better final lotion or cream to use
  didnt mean to quote forgiveness please
  well you can just get pure lactic acid from a pharmacy at least here in australia and lately ive been ordering elizaveccas witch piggy hyraluronic acid serum from korea  its about 8 aud for 50ml with 92 hyaluronic acid and 2 niacinamide so its been a good twofor
  thanks for the info fren i will definitely check these out do you order the latter off amazon  also are any of these products safe to apply directly under the eye

daily reminder to avoid the sun
ive been starting to get acne close to my hairline and down on the hollows of my cheeks some also pop up on my jaw ive never had pimples here before so what could be causing them i havent changed anything in my skincare someone said that my schampoo might be causing it
  nose strips to clear it out  antiblackhead face wash  toner to reduce the size of the pores
  dont go in sun  still have horrid spots of acne appear as soon as my fave clears up  why live
  i use this the people in my life have commented on how my skin is clearing up so id say the consensus is good

  looks good buddy
  thanks friend 
  how long have you been using it
  i went to the archive and copy pasted the most recent thread this is the 3rd time ive done this
  i use a bha serum followed by a clay mask which works well you could also try a physical extractor if youre skin is not prone to scarring
  13880335  cetaphil doesnt do much on its own i would suggest only using 25 benzoyl peroxide because its been proven to work best get a water based gel wash your face with whatever apply it thinly over any areas you might get big pimples then let it dry and moisturise over it do that daily
  do you wash your face in the morning or just moisturise
  what water based gel do you recommend  do i use the cleanser then the gel moisturise then benzac  also the 5 helps to remove pimples around my mouth but doesnt prevent them on my forehead   im also going to book a doctors appointment for my cheek as i believe they are cysts
  possibly did you get a new shampoo it could also be the season has the climate or weather particularly changed what skin type do you have
have any of you anons used any kbeauty skincare products i found some sheet masks that seem to make my face absolutely radiant and i feel fabulous as fuck afterwards but other than that i havent really entered into that realm i have heard positive chatter about a lot of routines and products any recommendations
  yeah its not the 1st time it has happened just unnecessary to have separate links for all those small snippets of text
anyone have experience with this or any other skin whitening products any recommendations
  currently i am taking glutathione and whitening injections i not trying to get pale just trying to remove this deep tan from over the years    three injections in and i have a glow      i purchased tranexamic acid pills and am thinking about using them but my doctors said that it could give me an embolism        i do what questions do you have
after checking through the archive i found my old routine    morning  baby shampoo  nivea facial wash  stridex  cetaphil moisturizer    evening  baby shampoo  cerave gentle cleanser or cetaphil foaming cleanser  nivea facial wash  stridex  cetaphil moisturizer    my skin improved quite a lot back then however i stopped sometime at the beginning of the year and its gone to shit again    ive ran out of stridex and cetaphil    i used to wash my face with diluted apple cider vinegar too at some point which also worked but its pricy     i cant get stridex anymore in the uk for a decent price so im pretty bummed out ill post a pic in reply    any recommendations on routine changes/things i can use
  pic related used to cut them in half it latest me a good while        i use this its pretty good idk if ive gotten too used to it tho cos it used to be really hot on my skin at first which was great but now i dont feel shit from it
  the reviews say that its good for removing dark spots and scars which i need but i also want paler skin any product recommendations  also for the soap did you experience irritation or some sort of reaction with continued use
  salycic acid wipes after indian aztec clay mask with apple cider vinegar instead of water as base for the mask moisturize with hyaluronic acid moisturizer
  weird its ready cold on my skin i dont like it
  thats it it was cold thats it like but it works well believe me youll get used to it 
is this even a good routine  ice pack  deep pore cleanser lotion  water activated gel cleanser  honey almond body scrub  herb mint facial mask  aftershave lotion with little or no alcohol  moisturizer  antiaging eye balm  moisturizing protective lotion
  my bf uses this and it works for him so he recommended it i used it for a few days and it burned when id put it on and it made my whole face visibly red the rest of the day i never thought i had sensitive skin but maybe i do i have greasy skin and my bf has dry for reference
ive been using proactiv for a few months and its been working well enough i still have some acne but admittedly my hygiene is not great im almost out and i cannot at all afford refills is there a good cheap alternative or is anything else recommended  this is me   and ive also used this african soap bar a woman who gave me a facial said i should use but it didnt work for me  i also have issues with acne around my shoulders   18/f/greasy skin
my face always has slight redness around nose and below my mouth tried a bunch of shit but nothing helps
  pretty sure those are sebaceous filaments
any sunscreen recommendations for daily use or an spf moisturizer
can nofap lessen acne formation masturbation is a sourse of shortterm testosterone boost which is pumping oil to the surface of skin isnt it
how do i get rid of selfharm scars  dermarolling improved the shallow ones greatly but barely affected my burn scars and the deeper cuts  i just want to be able to wear short sleeved shirts again
does anybody use products from the bodyshop    i have oily skin and started using their tea tree oil cleanser and exfoliator should i steer clear
  holy heck this  id like to know if theres anything to be done for deep scars as well
  i really want to know about this
  ive tried a bunch of stuff  after almost 4 years the deep cuts are still very visible
  just ordered some myself since im away from any ulta or target people say its good and doesnt leave as much white face as the other cheap ones japanese sunscreen is supposedly the best physical stuff    sulfur vs benzoyl peroxide for acne im looking around but people on leddit use way too much shit my routine is going to be cleanser aha for some fungal acne moisturizer and maybe a bit of vaseline when i go to bed
      i think there are dermatological procedures you could look into to my knowledge they might not be too expensive all things considered    otherwise ive heard that lemon and aloe vera might work well over time as topical treatments but im guessing youve tried those by now
how do i get rid of this fast plz help 
  nice hair    benzoyl peroxide cream to shrink then after an hour or so pop if you can then cortisone cream for inflammation thats if you only care about getting rid of it asap it will still look red because of all the blood drawn to it but it wont be swelled
  my paulas choice advance replenishing toner came in today i replaced my lush tea tree toner with it and honestly i have no idea what toner is even suppose to do i just use it bc i saw it in a skin care routine     i looked it up and it says its suppose to set the skin but it doesnt feel like it really does anything to me

what do i do with thick curly hair im out of ideas
  what do i do with hair
  alright ill elaborate ive tried wearing it short but i feel like i cant pull it off because i dont have a very strong jaw line and ive tried growing it out but then it ends up being a jewfro its so thick its hard to style any particular way so i just wear hats
is cold shower better     theres also that shampoo and conditioner thats received over 500 positive reviews
  yeah i have the same hair i grew it out to about two feet and as long as you take care of it along with the fact that it will weigh down once its long enough you avoid the afro look eventually i chopped most of it off though    you could grow it mid length and have a stylist take some of the volume out maybe part it or slick it back with some product
  yeah now that i think about it ive asked my stylist to take out some of the volume but she never does i dont think she understands what i mean probably just need to find a more competent one and go from there
ok so im trying the not washing every day thing and im looking kinda gross as a result havent washed since friday do i need to bite the bullet and just wash it every day or should i be doing something additionally also do i let it get wet in the shower or just keep it dry
which me is best me first two is me now last one is me twothree years ago or so also general opinion on how i should style it pls and ty

all these beautiful hair  what to do with this thick and dry shit 
need some advice for styling my hair pretty much every video i watched says to wet your hair and then blowdry it before styling with pomade i share a walk in bathroom with a roommate and usually get up at 6am while he doesnt get up until 8 or 9 i dont really want to take a shower and use a blow dryer that early since it will wake him up is there anything i can do while my hair is completely dry

how do i achieve this hairstyle i want to be a qt asian
keep it messy i dont like brushing it back because my ears are kinda big
  i have it  its not that nice really
  i will decide if its nice for me but how can i achieve this    and i guess this is similar to what im looking for
tried dying it white but turned yellow/gold    wtf do i do now
  middle my man
  you cant redye it again for a while because itll damage your hair too much youll just have to deal with it or alternatively take the buzzpill
  rip peep dawg
  ive tried scalp massage with castor oil makes it grow noticeably faster and overall longer hair if yours tends to stop i dont really know why but it also makes more hair grow too but im a girl tho so ymmv if you have hair loss
  so i cant dye it back to brown i dyed it myself
  buy this on amazon then mix it and apply it to your hair about 510 mins wella color charm t18 toner wella 20 volume developer this is the 2nd step you need to do after bleaching hair to make it white toner will not wreck your hair but if its already fried then also get a product called all plex and use it according to the directions with the toner
  i hate this yellow shit
  i cant remember the exact time it takes exact but i think its a ballpark from 46 weeks for your hair to be ready to dye again or youll damage your hair i used to dye my hair blonde for going to states in wrestling when i was in middle school
  so that will actually make my hair white and for how long i feel like i fucked up and idk what to do whether go white or back to brown
tfw i will never achieve this
tfw beautiful hair   feels good man
hey /effay/  wat do if you have thin natural not from balding straight blonde hair  any inspo  ive got a medium length cut rn  would appreciate it fellows  ps i have a big forehead kinda so any tips on how to just conceal or rock it would help 3
  just dont cut it mine took about a year with no haircuts
  how do i into volume though
  pic of your hair now i just use shampoo/conditioner my gf uses and she always buys different ones so i cant say anything specific    i guess also let it air dry if i brush mine i can make it long and silky smooth but if i just let it dry out of the shower it does    it also looks like that after i wake up after it gets tangled all night sleeping/moving around
  salt water spray or just salt water if youre near the ocean

my wussy buddy didnt want to come here for advice himself so i am posting on his behalf my other friend and i have been trying to help our wussy friend for awhile now with his hair but we just cant seem to figure out a cut/style for him what do you all suggest  any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated gotta help out friend so that we can make him into a better waifu neet for the cage ha   heres a fairly recent photo of him for reference good luck to anyone who tries to come up with something good for him
  hitler youth/something of this sort     aka cut the sides but leave length up top
  he also sort of looks like him austin augie
    little bit off topic but who is this austin augie in particular
  you ever see that episode of friends where ross has leather pants
  ive gone through various routines from lazy to somewhat carefull and still looks same only difference is it sometimes gets insanely frizzy      what does salt water spray do will it work for fine hair
    i didnt say the fit was my goal
  one concern i do have is that his my buddy hair is a little thin not much volume/thickness to it i think that might impede what we can do with his hair
  hes a pro bmx rider/model with img hes been in vogue and a bunch of other shit he also does youtube vlogs/short films/editorials for fashion companies/brands     just get some product to make it thicker     do you have another pic of him
  can not get any more based than this desu senpai
  heres the only other recent image of him i could find
what do i do
any recs on a matte hair product that gives a strong hold for volume all day  i cant for the life of me figure out how to keep my hair to not fall flat even after blow drying it w/ and w/out hairspray  it could also be how my hair is cut and how thick it is but a product in the right direction could help i suppose

  does it look good when you grow it out
i wanna buzz my hair i think my hair being so thick and the way it grows makes it high maintainance accordingly i can only get it to look decent 30 of the time     any objections
what do yall think if my hair im thinking of growing it way longer
  i object
  reee  it only looks decent for not much of the time the other times its all fluffy and dry and makes my head look dumb   i more want to know  do i have the skull/face shape to pull off buzz  im 62 and reasonably athletic 94kg if it matters
  on that guy you posted  opinion invalidated

is a cold shower really that detrimental to hair ive read somewhere here that it even contributes to balding
i wish i didnt have to cut all of this because its so comfy to have but i have to be a wagecuck soon    one positive i can take away from this is that everyone thats in a band in my local scene has long unkempt hair what hairstyle do i get so i stand out from them while still being relatively workappropriate
should i just trim the sides and keep it long rec pls    your hair is beautiful 
  looks like a fucking mess to be honest m8

  this pic looks the best but partly due to picture quality and better lighting
  chad  talks like a baby
  whered u get this shirt
    get conditioner
  i use it every day  maybe mine is shit any recs
  thats what conditioner does to my hair
    idk which one is which but theres no way either of you actually use real conditioner not the 2 in 1 shit actual conditioner has stuff like fatty alcohols glycerin etc that attaches to your hair and adds weight/moisture and makes it easier to style and gives it volume or has silicones that coat hairs and make it easier to manage/shinier you shouldnt be washing every day too rinsing with showers is fine but shampooing isnt necessary more than every other day even if you sweat and workout for hours a day    dont buy anything marketed towards men any drug store brand that is in the womens section should work and is a dedicated conditioner not a 2 in 1
    for past 2 weeks i shampoo 3 timed a week and conditioned every day maybe missed 1 day i think i prolly got a shitty conditioner  how should i let my hair dry after showers is rubbing it with a towel bad for it ice always did that because it was really quick should i just shake off excess water and let it dry naturally
  dont rub it with a towel just press the towel to absorb the water get clean living or aussie conditioner its dirt cheap and available in every store and pharmacy and works leave it in for a couple of minutes and dont use it like shampoo    if youre trying to get it like your pic   then you can get a leave in to put on while your hair is drying to make it dry flatter
  what do you mean by and dont use it like shampoo
  also if using a leave in does that replace the normal condition or use both
  dont lather it in then rinse off after 15 seconds let it sit for 5 minutes at least so the ingredients can work its not a meme
  nigga you gay
  oh ok i usually let shampoo sit for 12 mins should i stop doing that as well
what should i do
  kiss me
  nothing wrong with that as long as you condition afterwards and dont shampoo every single day
what is this haircut and how can i ask my barber for it
  she them that picture kek
  looks kind of dry dry stop shampooing and just wash with a gentle conditioner if it gets greasy after that we can talk style
  i dont want to do that because i get my hair cut by scary latinos and theyll call me a nerd
  it looks great and would look nice long too but i hope the mustache is negotiable if you dont like the clean shaved look just keep some stubble around       hard to tell without seeing your face but i lean no      gonna get onions tits from all those parabens
what should i do i want to grow my hair out to chin length and leave it like that and i been trying the curtains meme do i pull it off pls no bully
  it looks okay
how easy is it to maintain a medium length style yourself ive never had my hair longer than four inches in my entire life and i always just maintain it myself except a barber visit every 45 months ive got some good clippers and hair scissors but i dont know a thing about longer hair    ive grown it out to 8 inches right now and ive got a full blown goddamn mullet im getting axed tomorrow whether medium length styles are easy to maintain or not determines whether i try something new or go back to my usual undercut
  maintain yourself no it will 100 look horrible if you had really short or really long hair its possible but whats so bad about spending around 20 bucks a month on a haircut people spend that much on coffee for their week
  aside from basic living expenses rent groceries bills i spend probably less than 30 a month i dont want to double that just for a hairstyle that might not even look good on me anyway ive got a fresh round of interviews coming up next week so thats why im finally getting it cut tomorrow if all goes well i might actually be able to afford 20 more per month so it might be worthwhile i guess
  forgot to ask do you guys all go to specific places to get your hair cut the same way each month or what theres only two places in town that cut hair and you get a random person each time ive never met two barbers that interpret a style the same way
when the fuck do i use shampoo
            very fine taste anon
what is the best product to use to style your for a hitler youth/this type of haircut    would a molding clay work best    i want something with a low shine or matte finish preferably
    theres only two places in town that cut hair   where the fuck do you live a stretch of texas desert or something you can always go to a womens salon they wont care i go to a nearby barber that im familiar with but theres like 7 places within 10km that do mens hair and i dont live in a populated area
  no just a small town of 5k people in oklahoma i could always go to the city i guess but thats approaching an hour round trip just to get a haircut im including the womens salon at least the closest thing we have in the two already i guess technically theres a third sportscuts which has a reputation i can attest to as being the absolute worst place you could ever go to get a cut
  oil based pomade/cream with low shine  you will need something with weight to it
  find a good place in the city with a decent rep maybe has a dedicated instagram as that will indicate they are up to date on modern styles and generally know their shit just take the trip into the city and pony up for a nice haircut and get yourself a nice meal and do something nice for yourself to build up confidence and self esteem treat it like an investment
  cool     my hair is really frizzy and dry with enough care i can get it like that right
  this hair is terribleits the face that makes it good
  if you mean like jake in the movie probably not desu he has unreal hair genetics its thick straight and dense you can do literally anything with it and that undercut is different from the common ones its layered at the top to create more volume and slightly connected at the sides    buy a single use keratin protein mask packette its like 3 or 4 bucks at any salon/beauty place and use it on clean hair after you shampoo and leave it in for a minute or so longer than it says on the instructions and then rinse off and blow dry or air dry it will help with your frizzyness and make your strands slightly more rigid and help create more volume for the undercut
  and post pic here after you style it and everything if you want so we can mock you and or compliment you
  thanks for the advice im not really interested in whatever modern trends are going on right now im just looking to get a classic mediumlength side part or something going since its similar to the short style ive always worn and looked decent with i figure just about any barber worth their salt would be able to do that for me what do you consider ponying up the place i usually go is 15 which is already more expensive than any place ive ever been including when i lived in denver      this is my problem as well and something thats always inhibited me from growing it out my hair is extremely dry frizzy and wavy no matter how i wash it or what pomade i put in
  thank you man i really appreciate the advice    this is kind of the ideal maybe a little bit longer on the sides i do high end security mostly for alisters and such so i think the look works well with what i do     in addition to the protein masks should i be practicing anything else to keep my hair tamed and tidy
  lmao i will
  pony up as in pay for the bus/train/w/e into town to get a haircut and while youre there get a meal you like get some hair product see a movie or something you dont have to go in just for one reason 15 sounds normal for a general barbershop     if you absolutely want to save as much as possible you can go to a local cosmetology school and be a volunteer for one of the students and get a free cut they should be more than able to do a medium length cut for a part
  in addition to the protein masks should i be practicing anything else to keep my hair tamed and tidy    depends on what your hair responds to a protein mask once a month is good maintenance and wont hurt and will probably help with some frizz but you might benefit from a conditioner with certain ingredients or a clarifying wash once a month if you have hard water just have to experiment occasionally definitely avoid high shine pomades/gels/etc its extremely played out if you go with an oil based pomade you dont have to rewash every day you can actually just sleep with it as gross as it may sound then use a little bit more in the morning to restyle ive read people that did that and said their hair looked amazing and was healthy since it was essentially oiled and protected all the time
  sounds good thank you a ton anon
  would really appreciate some input
  late 90s leo had the best hair of all time

what do with this hair /fa/  im going to get it cut next week havent been in 6 months now but i dont know how it should look  i dont want to get a short cut since i have a pretty weak jaw and chin and am pretty selfconscious about it
what to do i used to have an undercut with a quiff but i wanted to grow it up as i got too self conscious about my head shape and receding hairline  rounded forehead    i dont know if im in the wierd phase or something but my hair is just too wavy what do i do with it
  more proof that haircut doesnt matter its all about the face
before haircut
  after still kinda regret cutting that shit though desu

  thats the main place i shop
  their inhouse brand is shit but they have some nice fila and kappa stuff
  fila and kappa have been overdone to shit these past couple of years with the vintage sportswear trend ive seen so much im sick of both
  i have known fila from 2 monthes ago since i came /fa/ did /fa / talked about fila past couple of years ago genuinely curious if i late to the party
  fila has just been hyped like kappa and champion because all three were popular sportswear brands in the 90s stores like urban outfitters and pacsun put a bunch of logo heavy fila champion and kappa in their stores and now npcs just go in and buy the lastest stock i see so many people with the same champion script logo shirt its getting very old the only thing i like about champion is their blanks champion hoodies are comfy as fuck
  quick visit to the uo homepage made me hate rick and morty too    reeeeeeee
patrician taste op
  you can go back to rddit know or /b/
they used to have a section for refurbished vintage clothes i found a couple of good things there
  she looks so fucking cute aaaaaarrrgggghghhh if i would just man up and start talking to people i would get someone like her but no i just have to be a faggot who cant go up to someone and say hi fuck why do i even keep this up the fashion the lifting the music listening the music playing it all means nothing if i cant introduce myself to strangers fuck
  this but postironically
why is she so perfect bros
  i cant wait till i build up the courage to get rejected will feel amazing not even joking
  pretty much the same reaction to seeing op pic
  only we can save ourselves anon only you can take that leap
seems to me like virtually anywhere can be /fa/ so long as you mix garments well and are buying the appropriate fits and such
  shes hot looks like shes wearing a handbag though

  we arent granted anything in this universe anon you just have to go for it its all youve got in this lonely world you might fail time and time again but thats better than always wondering what if if 100 rejections means that out of those rejections you get to meet the one then it seems like its worth it to take that leap into the unknown
i bought two 2 kankens on sale from there for cyber monday like the filthy pleb i am theyre effay to me
  kappa has always been the shit champion and fila ill never get they were fucking walmart kmart brands

    this unfortunately i havent found anything worthwhile there since they removed that section from my local store about one or two years ago
  embarrassing you thought of this and then went out of your way to actually make it
she looks like she _______________
  lol pretty sure thats a dress
  kånkens are annoying and confusing they have way too many pockets they dont have much room either i doubt i can fit a laptop in one
  this are there any backpacks that look cool like the kanken but are also actually useful
  look cool  useful  pick one
    what the one my fiance has only has two pockets and im pretty sure if you buy the right one its fucking designed to got a laptop in    straps look uncomfy but hell youre not going to do more than dunder around a city centre with it get a grip
  the larger computer friendly version of the kånken

i bought a pair of twill pants with a semaphore flag allover print at uo like five years ago that i still get complements on every time i wear them so i would say yes sometimes

  bottom half 8/10 boots toebox is ugly tho top half hideous pls kys
logos make you look like a race car driver but the hat suggests park ranger so you look like a race car park ranger driver get rid of the logos though and i dont think you would look that bad maybe live in a western state to fully pull it off
hey man do you play drums
  nice example of western core it would look better without the logos though your hat also looks very similar to the one worn by frank in once upon a time in the west which company made that hat
  look like you could play in a punk band
  what you need is a bigger belt buckle
  yee haw/10
  tell me more about that hat the brim looks good but the head part looks to tall makes it look like a hasidic or amish hat take more pics of hat ive been looking at buying a bolero
saint laurent alabama
bullrider core
looks great i like it a lot
  thats pretty a specific style most places i know people would go wtf is with that dude might pull it off in the southwest usa or at a larper festival ps logos/branding is never effay
  great fit man me and a buddy are starting an electronic rap group and are looking for a drummer to help spice up our style a little you seem like the perfect guy for the gig interested
  jewish cowboy
  you look like the type of guy who goes out to the middle of the desert to play drums and smoke meth
  the hat needs a monster energy logo
that shirt is awful
    the hat does look similar to the one worn by the villain in once upon a time in the west i think the op hat is slightly taller in the crown and a little more flat brimmed but it could be the angle making look so here is a reproduction of that movie hat but its not exactly a bolero hat as it has a somewhat dipped brim and the top of the hat crown is telescope creased not flat up there lee van cleef known for his portrayal of the bad in the good the bad and the ugly wore a very similar style hat but with kind of a lower crown    
  hey  nice fit 
  hey nice fit op you are rocking it owo

  can i get an id on the boots
  what are those boots
  theyre just like generic usgi boots from the 80s/90s i think
usually without the hoodie unless it is freezing
  yeah i think i will go for a nonlarp coat/jacket different gloves and a different backpack finding the right coat/jacket is the hardest part right now
  the god of npcs with the notable exception of the boots and the accessories there isnt much going on here
  alternative
  i think this is really unoriginal and just a random conglomeration of normie dress code      ugly shoes      2000 upvotes on /r/malefashion      this is pretty hip right now and i like it too although i prefer forest green over purple      wat      normie      also normie
  id on that fuckign sweater been looking for one like that for ages
  
  thank you kindly
  i dont understand why people create grids for stuff like this dude this is a very average outfit that you can thrift for under 100 bucks on a friday morning

  nice    like this jacket
never really felt yeezys before but bit the bullet and desired to go for the shoe because of its unique textures and shape     i enjoy these a lot             but the rest arent terrible

jacket is actually a military shirt that i wear over a wool jumper
  normie      jacket and shoes are great      unironically my favourite thing posted on /fa/ in a while       clean      whatre you playing rn

this thread has more interestings look than usual      aside from the shoes i really like it but id avoid snakers maybe derbies instead      interesting  id like to see how it comes together      very clean simple shoe/pant interaction is crucial i guess      hate this jacket too bad to see these kind of boots wasted with epic gamer earbuds and encre noire which debatably smells like urine      nice fren

any tips on poorfag fashion
  go thrifting
hunt a bear or something and use its fur for clothing
  literally jeans wranglers or lee or something and a plain white tshirt go for the rugged look
  this is the most sound advice     is hard to pull off and will make you look like a fag
take the costcopill and go full kirkland
  jeans  white tshirt  hard to pull off  most basic outfit in existence will make you look gay
  its hard in the sense that you need to be muscular including legs to pull it off
  based advice anon        you guys think thrifting in more well off areas help me make better finds been thinking about that strategy for a while but i dont wanna waste bus fairs for nothing      maybe you were just gay all along
  maybe you were just gay all along  nigger are you fucking stupid or what do you know how to fucking read
  based and fully stocked in case of apocalypse
  shit ive been found out
  elder god tier socks
  buy secondhand errything besides thrifting i like shopping on ebay    military surplus is cheap and can be pretty effay    watch out for sales especially endofseason and holiday sales sign up for email newsletters for your favorite shopping sites to get alerts for when sales come up you missed black friday/cyber monday but theres also the endoftheyear sale coming up that lots of stores have
  thrift stores rotate stock between eachother if they are linked generally speaking you can see better quality in better areas i wouldnt waste bus fare though    the best way of going about it is to go there as often as possible or volunteer there because theyll have new stock out every day and thin out the old stuff    dont be afraid to try everything on as the sizes arent that accurate and if you really want to save money you can learn to taylor/repair stuff yourself    one last tip would be that you can normally find wool sweaters donate by old fat men and just shrink them in the washer/dryer until they fit i got a perfectly fitted lambswool sweater for next to nothing
first of all you should figure out your colors and try to keep your basics to those colors  the more clothes you have that work with each other  the more outfits you have    fit above all else  if you take even a cheap pair of jeans to a tailor and get them fitted youre going to have a pair that looks better on you than any several hundred dollar pair does for a fraction of the cost    invest in quality shoes or boots ebay and grailed are full of good 2nd hand stuff places like sierra trading post have factory 2nds which go for way under retail    take care of your items  even shitty quality can last ages if you treat it well  fold your clothes air them dont let them lose shape in a pile sitting in their own stink    /fit/ above all else  a good body gives cheap clothes the context of ruggedness and practicality
  this    if you buy leather shoes and keep them polished theyll last years much longer if you can replace the soles goodyear welt    dont skimp on the shoes if you cant afford decent ones just wait and save
  contrary to what /k/ makes you believe hunting in general is a really expensive hobby most hunters arent factory workers that take their grandfathers rifle and shoot some dear in their backyard like in the movies    depends on how poor were talking about and what country in general if youre poor best choice is to buy most of your stuff from stores like hm uniqlo and weekday and thrift more expensive items like coats   if you are too poor for that most countries have their own shops where only fob immigrants shop check those out or get your clothes from supermarkets
  how poor we talking     also marshalls/tjmaxx clearance racks will do you nicely      thrift stores are always a gamble id say its barely worth it if you have to travel far to get to one it also depends on what major city youre near i used to do the thrift store thing but its like digging for coins in the bottom of a trash can unless you live near some really great second hand shops i switched to marshalls a while back because the shopping experience is way better the stuff is new and clean obviously but you still get the thrill of finding some hidden treasure and can return stuff if you need to its more expensive than a thrift store of course but its worth the upgrade i still go to thrift stores for fun every once in a while and still like them but i dont rely on them so i guess thats what i would recommend marshalls  thrift stores      this is all good advice too

dear op  i know your pain  i am a 62 buffboi and borderline meathead  i went from a fatso emo kid to a bald art director in his 30s  my taste in whamen didnt change  i would love to attract such whamen    but they are attracted somehow to lanklet skinfags in turtlenecks and shaggy hair with books and cigs in their hands  you know that boho shit where they think they are artsy fags because of their monstera collection in their mom rented studio    sadly i have bad news for you op    these grills are sadly offlimit to you even tho they suffer highly advanced daddy issues    1 outta 20 might fall for you    back in the old days these pbr chicks would be all over you sadly youre not a fag to get your dick dipped in gauche pussy

  are you me
  new pasta
  i mean    100 this in my experience hotter girls are so sought after that the dudes they end up getting with are really socially skilled and/or successful in some capacity being manipulative is just another social skill albeit one that makes you a shittier person rather than a better one    you need people in general to want you/want to be you if you want hot girls to want you
  tfw no edgy parisian gf to drink wine and read baudelaire with  reee my ex
  i was hanging with the chick mia is always making out with in videos for a bit and honestly i never tried to get with her it was always her trying  i was in a weird suicidal volcel period and shes the one that tried to hook up  i guess girls like that just into damaged guys or some shit
  learn how to manipulate other people  any books on this

when i was 16 i started reading a lot and learning stuff about art and culture in hope to attract these kind of women  now at age 27 i have no problem to attract an arthoe or a pretentious bitch that is turned on by stupid posh intellectualism but there is no use for a woman like this much rather attract catholic humble smart girls instead
  whats the male equivalent to this
  same except a uneck shirt ig
write her a poem about the futile cycle of dressing to attract just so you can undress to repel
  catholicmatch  i know a dude whose personality is a lot like yours and hes not exactly aesthetic or /fa/ either his wife that he met on catholicmatch lol is a beautiful humble polite 8/10 at least who just finished grad school
i wanna know where you meet such girls at the first place where do i go

  audio is in stereo  some elements isolated to 1 speaker  why do people do this youre not listening to the actual song this way
  people do it to listen together obviously stop being a pedant
  i understand that obviously but if i wanted to listen to music id want to actually hear it who enjoys listening to half a song whether alone or with someone else just use a playlist sharing app and listen on your own earphones  its not like youre going to talk to each other anyways and if i wanted to share a song with someone im with i wouldnt want them to listen to half a song and get a bad first impression it just makes no sense to me unless you have utterly appalling hearing or taste if its just about the shared social connection then why not have a fucking conversation or hold hands or do some other shit that doesnt involve watering down an experience you can have on your own i listen to music with my gf at home on my system not in public so i can ignore her while were out together and get a halfassed version of what i could be doing at home anyways
  i listen to music with my gf at home    no you dont
  ok
  any robert greene book but particularly art of seduction i saw someone mention 48 laws but that one is more about moving up career ladders which of course involves manipulation but its not covered to the same extent as seduction art of seduction is solely about getting people to do whatever you want them to do     stop living in a fantasy world to win you gotta play dirty yeah it sucks but thats just how humans work
  what kind of fucking creature is that in her hands though
  all girls want gigachad if youre not this level of masculine you have no chance of getting a gf these days
  the only true gigachad

hey guys which canada goose jacket should i buy  please help
falling for the goose meme
the one sold by fouad for 150 on facebook marketplace cash only
  explain please
  junya  u  n  y  a
  overpriced decent quality brand that has multiple much cheaper and much nicer alternatives
  tell me the cheaper and nicer alternatives please
  pretty much anything sold at an outdoors store
i got the basic model chilliwack six or so years ago its very warm and good quality but its still overpriced look into less hyped up brands  or if you really want to spend money woolrich makes some really nice parkas that are more understated than cg
  thanks for that i was intrested in what the base model is i dont want any fancy shit just the standard model with the fur on it can you tell me anything else about it are there any other models you considered buying
i still dont understand what brings people that wear generic immigrant/hool fashion like canada goose cp project parajumpers stone island armani etc to /fa/
  you probably wont need to layer under it and the sizing is quite large i usually wear m clothing and my cg is an s whats annoying about it and the reason why i said its overpriced is that it only has one interior pocket that barely holds anything and the velcro on the two exterior pockets is kind of shitty though maybe newer models are better  if i had been willing to pay more i wouldve bought cgs chateau parka probably since the chilliwack doesnt cover my ass the chateau also looks better less puffy due to not being a bomber  i got my cg at a discount but i paying full retail for it is kind of a waste unless you really like it
  the sizing is quite large  shit im usually between size s and m so i hope an s will cut it  i dont like the chateau because of those huge buttons have you thought about getting one of those expedition ones
  i tried on an xs once and it fit i probably couldnt layer underneath though im 510/150lbs or 178cm/68kg youll be fine with an s  those huge buttons  i think theres a model without those citadel or something its been a while since ive last looked at cg stuff  expedition  too heavy and bulky i dont live in siberia so i have no need for it you underestimate how warm those jackets are even in subzero weather ive never layered underneath the cg
    ahh i just read up they actually have something called fusion fit for manlets like me sounds goo
  yeah im the same weight but 58  im really not sure i might get the chilliwack id rather have one that doesnt have the bomber fit at the bottom but i cant find a parker one without huge buttons without straps shit everywhere but with the fur
  58  try on an xs to be sure  and yeah i dont know about the specific models keep looking and make sure the temperature rating or whatever its called is at least as high as the chilliwacks
  they dont carry the citadel anymore the maitland looks nice but it doesnt have a fur  fucking hell
  fur is inconvenient most of the time doesnt add warmth and eventually gets thinner as time goes by
  yeah but i like the way it looks
  plenty on ebay
  the fake ones like every other normie
op here im just coming home from the city i bought the maitland one in dark blue  it doesnt have fur on it but i decided ill just shoot some animal and have the fur of whatever animal i kill sewn onto the hood
take the arcteryx pill
  good idea switch to an equally overhyped overpriced brand
id never wear cg anymore at least here in northern eu immigrants with their fakes or might even be real thanks to their ridiculous welfare benefits are walking around with these everywhere
  i hate immigrants as much as the next guy but this mindset is retarded dont let the fucking immigrants destroy anything for you i still drive my old eclass mercedes even though all the fucking turks drive them its a good car same for the jackets fuckem immigrants fuck them fuck fuck fuck i hate them but dont let them ever destroy anything for you
  the only reason canada goose is a big thing just like stone island is because of immigrants i dont even believe you knew the brand before half your city was wearing it
  i want a canada goose jacket since i saw one in a catalog about 1520 years ago its only now that i can afford one i literally got my first paycheck today and i dont know what shithole youre from but here in austria i have never seen a single refugee with a canada goose jacket
  in westerneurope muslims have them for 3 years now at the very least
bought a north face gotham jacket on sale last year herringbone color fuckin love it its my cold weather go to fuck cg
  i usually just get down jackets anywhere else when they eventually go 6080 off in clearance in summers
only chang and wu li buy from canada goose now
  stfu poorfag
why not get a fjallraven parka instead same warmth but none of the negative connotations and ethically sourced if you care about that shit
  lel take a look at this poorfag
  hi wang li
supporting animal cruelty is not effay  only stupid chinese and hypebeasts buy canada noose
    still samefagging in almost 2019
    cant name one
  lmao i know a wang li and hes a hypebeast as well
  i got the one from uniqlo since it was the cheapest its really warm and it feel comfy it does well in the cold but im expecting to have to wear a light sweater underneath when it gets to single digits     everlane and carharrt wip also have parkas that look pretty good and arent as over priced as canada goose
  question would u buy it if the base model didnt have the patch on it because that is literally the entire brand the brand is based on that arm patch like you got it at boyscouts or something people dont think its real unless it has the patch but u can buy jackets for 100 that just copy that arm band patch meme     people pay 900 for a meme arm patch its almost as bad as common projects stencil lettering meme both companies canadian but run by chinks
  its the same as why people walk around after work showcasing their security card key from working in an office it gives them a sense of superiority a patch a literal brand like branding from a cow brand it symbolizes higher caste within some arbritrary heirarchy
  sorry to piss on your canada goose thread though if that is what you want and the jacket excites you then get it enjoy just because someething is a meme doesnt mean it cant be enjoyed knowing that it is a meme really ruins the fun of it
solid roi
  none theyre overrated anyway
  triple fat goose
how do i into this aesthetic serious
youre a retarded faggot serious
  ok but how do i look like daffy here
  red turtleneck golden frame aviators brown sport jacket

  the bird is not real it is a drawing
  how do i look like the guy in the picture
  he plays noble knights
what is this jeff goldblum
anyone got inspo pics of this kind of gold frame turt neck and blazer combo
ive lurked for a while and im pretty confused whats the point in brand name things is it just to flaunt the money you have some of the things i see listed on these big brand sites look completely awful whats the point of investing in such expensive clothing items that have no definitive style a lot of people here really pull off the whole model/effay look vibe pretty clearly but i doubt they go all out on their clothes and just pick what they like/feels what looks good on them
  vanity
its for the flex
  what this guy said    also if youre in a niche where being superficial and shallow is good then big brands can impact you positively
  the only logos i seek are trefoils everything else i try to get blank
  lurk moar and this   
            thread full of retards who dont understand fashion    some advice op dont listen to what anyone says on /fa/
  baseless accusations  no elaboration
  i agree that a lot of people just buy brand names for the flex but i cant speak for them i just know that personally ive found that fast fashion brands simply dont produce the quality or type of clothes i enjoy specific sharp and sleek designs coatings and out of the box designs ive only found in some higher end designer clothing that completely breathes life into outfits once i got my hands on some stuff like hm seemed soulless obviously the quality to price difference isnt enough for some people but to me it makes me love fashion and ill pay the price for unique clothing the best thing you can do is to wear clothes you can actually pull off though if you buy stuff that doesnt suit you than it wont look good no matter how much you spent hope this helped you understand
do any of you know where to find this tshirt    looked all over but couldnt find anything
why would you willing wear a bible verse on your shirt
  because im christian but its effay enough that i would not combust with shame wearing it
  its got an inverted/petrine cross on it though  also is this guy in a band or something that might help

its an old southern lord shirt you will really struggle to find it if its even possible
  if this is for southern lord records are you sure its a christian shirt i mean im not saying converge and southern lord are antireligious i just cant imagine ben koller is a devout christian

  only if you have the jawline
  only chads can pull off a mustache because they can pull off anything
  only if your a lazy or neet  t neet
moustaches are gay
  stache in the summer beard in the winter is how i usually roll
fuck the modern man
i like it pictured is the look im going for
  the pedos kinda ruined them for us   cant have a moustaches without people thinking you fiddle kids
  mustache n wife beater combo
yes
  yes beards are oversaturated and cleanshaven is for grandpas the moustache will get you noticed
  this is why they work so well today because most guys are too afraid to adopt them for that exact reason there are a hundred ways to groom one without giving that vibe
how do you make double denim not look like complete goofy trash
  different colors can help
  i gotchu
  just be skinny tall and attractive
  holy fucking reddit onions man
  soy as fuck
  blue denim looks like ass no matter how you try to pull it off
  no you dont
  are you the same jungle chink who has the slp outfit jfc dude just stop
  this pretty obvious    close the only denim top i own is black kind of ez mode with the color but pretty much the only way id see most people making it work    kind of like the jacket and shirt together but for the life of me cant see what pants youd wear to pull it off
are carhartt tees /effay/ formerly /fah/
yes
  is this 2009 only old farmers wear carhartt people who actually do shit you know
  no stop cosplaying as a prole
  nah carhartt has a fashion line called work in progress not sure how youre not aware of this already honestly
can anyone recommend some good brands the only nice one i know of are warby parkers but my insurance doesnt cover them is ray ban still a solid company
cartier gucci prada mykita or any other korean/german eyewear brand
thoughts on round frames
  no thoughts to be had its just like any other frame either you have the face shape for them or you dont
  how do i know what frames fit my face
  ray ban doesnt exist anymore the brand was bought by a huge corporation luxottica who outsourced everything to china
  this is a draw i made i think its a oval shaped squared chin and wide cheeks thats why im thinking in the round frames
  you try them on fucking retard its completely impossible to tell whether glasses will look good on you or even fit you based on a picture
  i dont trust in mirrors man i look totally different uglier in photos
  really doubt round frames would look good    that doesnt matter a mirror is the best way to judge frames by yourself
  any midrange recommendations
  this advice is so stupid you should know if youve ever worn actual glasses for any length of time that you grow accustomed to the point any bad glasses can look tolerable on anyones face outside opinion is absolutely necessary
  this also you have tones of infographics and all sorts of shit telling you what face shape fits what pair of glasses if that interests you
anything other than dita is pajeet tier
saint laurent paris
this would be pretty good with black jeans
  no its just a basic bitch garbo outfit how to look like you shop at zara for 1k

  man i dont mean this in an adventurous fashion that defies norms makes me uncomfortable sort of way i mean this in the most sincere legitimate way possible that fit is fucking gay like gay festival clothing minus the jacket and ive been to a few so id know im not one to usually call fashion gay and i even love the effeminate look  but its just such a faggy look goddamn
  yoox is where we see the dark side of famous designers
  lol i bet ur a faggot urself u dont know shit about fashion get the fuck out of /fa/ bitch
  please wear something like the op irl  itll act as a purple star for everyone around you
  yoox is truly hell  it is possible to find something worthwhile though but you might spend literally over 2 hours sifting through mountains of garbage upon garbage upon garbage
is it possible to achieve pimpcore as a white man or would that just be sleazecore
  pimpcore is a subgenre of sleazecore
  other way round imo
  you tell me
i want to order some junglerats but am not sure which color i mainly dress in dark tones and want to get more of a techwear vibe so im 60 for black but the matt look of the beige and brown ones is also nice    also can you recommend similar combat boots in or below the price range of 100 buckos appreciate all comments
any good pants/jeans in the 0  99 range not made in shithole countries
  nah wranglers are good in that price rane but they are made in a shithole  maybe if you are lucky you can buy something like paul smith portugal or canali italy or norse propirtugal on sale for that price range
  even if they are not actually made in a shithole country they are probably going to be made by people from a shithole country so whats the difference
naked and famous during sale
unbranded jeans are woven in japan but assembled in macau basically china     with the closing of cone mills american denim doesnt exist anymore and jeans made entirely in japan are out of your budget
can you wear chucks with a casual sport coat the only nice nondress shoes i own are a pair of red wings pic is jacket in question
can you  you can there isnt some weird spell in play that wont stop you from physically doing it  should you  probably not might look goofy and you might look underdressed depending on where you are  will you  thats your call
  thanks
i can only imagine chucks with a linen blazer or something something super casual that goes with jeans sport coats are more traditionally worn with shoes or loafers that have leather soles
feel free to talk about it here
  i loved all the touch outfits  still do

  korean clothing fashion does take a lot from french fashion and other countries although there are plenty of innovations that are uniquely asian and certainly there is some creativity but the best contribution korea provides to the world of fashion is its wealth of excellent cosmetics and skin care products
shouldve just been a neo couture technology thread
can anyone link to solid glasses they wear where are all the rounded ones from ive read an article about korean eyewear not so long ago but i was looking for something along the lines of prada gucci or mykita does anyone have a pic where an asian is wearing any of these or similar frames
  a lot from french fashion   quite the understatement    there are plenty of innovations that are uniquely asian  like    but the best contribution korea provides to the world of fashion is its wealth of excellent cosmetics and skin care products  their best contribution to fashion isnt fashion
  if you think cosmetics and skin care arent part of fashion youre beyond saving
  in the dictionary definition of the word theyre not
kpoppers have no fashion sense everything is stolen from the west
    wikipedia  fashion is a popular style especially in clothing footwear lifestyle products accessories makeup hairstyle and body    here are a number of definitions from various dictionaries  n a current constantly changing trend favored for frivolous rather than practical logical or intellectual reasons    n popular trends    n the prevailing mode or style especially of dress custom or conventional usage in respect of dress behavior etiquette etc particularly the mode or style usual among persons of good breeding    n customary make or style in dress ornament furnishings or anything subject to variations of taste or established usage specifically that mode or style of dress and personal adornment prevalent at any time in polished or genteel society as the latest fashions what so changeable as fashion    n the latest and most admired style in clothes and cosmetics and behavior    not a single one of these definitions or any other i have found exclude cosmetics and skin care
  dang what is he wearing
  only one of those definitions openly includes cosmetics unless youre going to try to argue that its included in the term mode or style in which case ill argue that the denmarks greatest contribution to fashion is their furniture     but could you instead use all that effort to explain to me how this is a thread about korean fashion literally every single picture posted in this thread is of koreans wearing blatantly western clothing in a blatantly western way
  dude have you not been on this board for more than a day furniture and cosmetics threads are fucking commonplace    it seems like youre arguing from a position of cultural appropriation or something what makes it korean is the fact that its worn by koreans and is popular in korea i thought you might just be honestly misinformed but youre actually either a willful imbecile or youre trolling    bully me i guess because ive taken your bait
  lol
  these girls are really ugly
  ctrlf catalog furniture  0  ctrlf archive furniture  0  but ok    it seems like youre arguing from a position of cultural appropriation or something  no koreans can wear western clothing all they want thats not why im arguing with you    what makes it korean is the fact that its worn by koreans and is popular in korea  so you just wanted a thread about english outdoorswear french high fashion skirts tartan whatever as worn by koreans     most of all though id like the second question in this  answered

  i just think they look sort of uncanny valleyesque this music video made me genuinely flinch away from the screen as their pearly white perfectly smooth skin huge vacant glassy eyes forced smile and colored contacts scared me 
  this was for halloween the creepy eyes are on purpose
  and the pearly white perfectly smooth skin huge vacant glassy eyes and forced smile as well
  fuck you
  19 years old 58 66 kilos mexican   how do i cop this style without looking like a total weeb thx
  looking like a weeb shouldnt be your first concern that would be how much money youre going to have to shell out unless youre willing to get fakes which kpop artists have been known to do themselves
  the huge vacant glassy eyes are included in the creepy eyes category yes
  many koreans wear western clothes in ways unlike how people in the places where those clothes were originally designed wear them its not hard to glance at some pictures of koreans vs pictures of french people to see this    if you need some names of korean designers because youre too fucking autistically retarded to google search korean fashion and compare your findings look up leesle hwang or munsoo kwon they have influenced the fashion scene in korea and globally and tend to use traditional inspirations    there was an interior design thread dancing all over the front page of /fa/ literally yesterday    i really dont understand what good splitting hairs is doing you other than fueling your misplaced need to be right cosmetics are fashion korean fashion is fashion as expressed and experienced by koreans and in korea youre the only one having a hard time understanding this
  gotcha im actually impressed that they managed to make me flinch though i cant remember the last time something on a tv or computer has made me do that
from seoul fashion week
  western   i know it may displease you but youre going to have to accept that global modern fashion is mostly western     unlike how people in the places where those clothes were originally designed wear them its not hard to glance at some pictures of koreans vs pictures of french people to see this  where im coming from is that my exposure to korean fashion is from the occasional kpop video ive watched this video basically illustrates what i mean  every single outfit looks like something straight out of an slp lookbook i dont get how what theyre wearing is somehow uniquely korean    leesle hwang or munsoo kwon  42 replies before an actual korean designer is even mentioned  lol    youre the only one having a hard time understanding this  i get it as i literally said in    i just wanted to know if that was what you wanted as thats what korean fashion apart from the traditional shit seems to boil down to
  your question has been answered twice but you continue to reply which might lead one to believe that you are either an idiot or a complete troll with no actual interest in the topic its not hard to look at that music video and then compare it to a music video from say the us and play spot the difference
  the only actual answer youve given me is they dress different which is a complete nonanswer as the same statement is true of fucking every other country on the planet ive asked how theyre different not if theyre different    its not hard to look at that music video and then compare it to a music video from say the us and play spot the difference  that us musicians dont look like theyre straight out of an slp lookbook is that what youre going to use as an argument for what constitutes korean fashion
  not that anon but us musicians look like shit and the average amerifat person looks like shit   they are no match to europe or asia in all things fashion  beauty
  does anyone has any pictures from the btspuma line i really love how they look but that emblem of theirs is putting me off
lmao

my face is fat i have been drinking straight water and i also cut out all fried food out of my diet its been almost 3 months and still my face is the same help me please    pic related sorry for shit quality
  it looks fine its not slp tier gount but doesnt look fat either  jaw workout or just loose wight  it doesnt matter what you eat fat is only lost globally thru the body you cant only loose face fat unless you get like coolsculpting or smtn
63 128 lbs  low 120 high 134  aesthetically i just like a lot of blacks since i have dark hair/eyes and im pretty pale large shirts and skinny jeans generally     question for you guys is long hair better for thinspo bodytypes i think androgyny is pretty cool so im growing it out is this a mistake
  i think its bad tips on losing weight i have zero motivation to workout so i was thinking fasting might be suitable for me
  you cant spot reduce fat retard keep cutting
  god you look like a faggot
  fasting is fine but you will have to be thinner if you have less muscle to avoid being skinnyfat  i like fasting because you can concentrate your effort into 1 or 2 days a week    u look pretty great long hair is good if you want andro andro is pretty great i would recommend femgen but they have gone to shit and its all just trannies and eggs  black is a good colour  i wouldnt loose more weight or you will be concentration camp tier    he prob is
i wanted to do a 24hr waster fast today but now i really want some scrambled eggs might do a ginger shot instead and hope that deads the craving
  keep urself buisy  you can always eat it tomarrow
  staying busy is the key to avoiding eating i dont do it on purpose i just naturally kinda get really into whatever im doing which prevents me from feeling hungry naturally thin people almost always have something they do regularly that overrules their hunger feelings
what did you eat today
  1500 calories mainly consisting of tuna eggs pork and some christmas cookies
    thanks i should be studying anyways since i have an exam tomorrow might take a nap when i get home to fast forward the time
  nothing but i did spend roughly 500 kcal on my bike    goal is sub 120 lbs before christmas
  2 cups of black coffee with some cinnamon and 5 cigarettes
  woke up had a glass of apple juice took a shower ate a small calzone going to drink tea until dinner
  only had 1 meal 3 scrambled eggs and a lot of kale with olive oil around 450 calories
get some muscles you guys make me sick
is it okay to drink diet sodas like diet coke and pepsi max or should i just be sticking to water and black coffee
  why would you ever drink canned cancer 
water  black coffee and green tea only acceptable drinks
  slim fit pants are too baggy on the thighs for me and while skinny pants are perfect on my thighs theyre a bit tight on the knees downwards so it gets too stacked / kneebagging    im seriously debating going thinspo and losing 10 pounds just so i can have a better fit with skinny chinos i just bought not sure if its even practical to tailor the cut between the rise and the knee    does this make sense losing weight to fit into clothes my bmi is around 20 anyways as a guy so i probably could lose some weight
  t /fit/ incel coper
    based        cringe
  a kfc biscuit 4 small homemade choc chip cookies a cup of almond milk and some carrots
  woke up and immediately drank sugar water  tea until dinner  i mean if youre going to fast at least do it right spreading out your meals over a longer period is not good    wake up and restrict all your calories to dinner better results even if both cases have the same calories
  yes they are 0 cal  dw about cancer unless ur like a health freak every 5 things you do gives u cancer  being alive gives you cancer    its worth it     acually water with sugar in it or a drink
  if you want advice then you need to post pics with angles where people can actually see the shape and contours of your face this pic makes it impossible to tell if your bone structure or salt intake or fat distribution are the main issue
  im not fasting i dont fast i had something to drink to wake up because i wanted something to drink i only ate 2 meals because i woke up at like 1 pm i drink tea because i like it
smoke a lot  still have big appetite  do fucking heroin  still have big appetite  appetite suppressors what fucking bullshit  someone rec me something that will actually make me stop wanting to stuff my face      gorgeous hair completely depends on your face which i cant see i always had long hair but it turns out i look way way better with a buzz  skinnies are lame as fuck though unless theyre corduroys
ok so ive been eating 600 cals/day for the past six months for the past week ive been eating 800 cals and have gained some weight if i keep doing this will i continue to gain weight or will my body adjust
  whats heroin like
  addaral  r u addicted to slag now  i think heroin junkies are thin because they have no money and just are too high 24/7 to eat    t h i s  desu i think they are lying
  you havent been eating 800cals then actually track your food with a real app like my fitness pal or cronometer     unless youre a 2 year old that sleeps 15 hours a day your tdee is well above 800
  lol you cant fuckign gain weight eating 800 cals a day fuck off
  ugh i ate so much shrimp 
    she could be like super tiny sedentary and already literally emanciated
  wake up and restrict all your calories to dinner better results  elaborate im not doubting you ive been doing this lately and it does feel better than eating through out the day its usually bc i plan to fast and eventually cave in at night time but going through most of the day on an empty stomach feels great
  ill try to post better pics but my bone structure is pretty average nothing special everyone tells me i just have chubby cheeks/face fat which hide my already average bone structure sorry for my hair getting in my face i cant help it my face fat really shows in this pic
  not the same person but  it shouldnt matter when you eat as long as it is the same time every day this is what i do and eat a one 10001500 cal meal a day and it works well might take a week to adjust to it but i feel like my body runs way better now too
    u look fine  cut more itll slim down
  not to sound like an idiot i dont really browse these threads by cut more do you mean eat less if thats the case i have a big appetite i think its because i never keep myself busy so i always end up eating like a fat fuck im 62 if that helps at all also i can usually fast but the next day im so hungry i end up stuffing my face any help would be greatly appreciated
        thats just unfortunate genetics you lack bone structure nothing you can do about it unless you get some fancy korean plastic surgery
  i just eat when im hungry im not very hungry when i wake up so i have a small lunch small snacks throughout the day sometimes then eat dinner
  learn to cook without oil and to like low calorie foods i also have a pretty huge appetite but cook mostly plant based meals and rarely use oil/butter  its really easy to cook low cal here are some good foods  eggs  75 each  medium potato  110 each and pretty filling  lettuce  like 80 for a whole head  broccoli  2030 a cup  cauliflower is same as broccoli  a whole can of pinto beans is about 350  cucumber  20ish i think  tomato is only 20ish  lots of deli cut meats are only 30ish depending on what you get i like 20 cal ham and 30 cal turkey  look for low cal whole wheat bread 50 or 60 a slice  yakisoba noodles are like 30 cal a bag makes a good amount for 1 meal  i dont remember much more i dont restrict like i used to but dont settle for an empty stomach its easy to be full and satisfied and still be way under tdee
when i did keto i would drop a ton of water weight in the first 2 weeks is there a way to get similar results without having to go super low carb for 2 weeks
  you cant reduce fat in one area fat burns mostly evenly throughout
  ik i lack bone structure its just that when i was skinnier my face use to be more sleek and my cheeks werent as chubby made me look a lot better but then i went and got depressed and ate      thanks a lot very helpful i also hear rice cakes are pretty good to snack on when losing weight
  losing water weight means nothing
  dont eat rice cakes they have no nutrients and the carbs will only inflame your insulin and desire for food    what helped me was eating just straight up meat with nothing else when i had that extreme desire for food like when i came back from work i felt full and satisfied where if i ate cereal or something carby i would feel hungrier an hour later      i know its meaningless but i hate looking bloated and puffy all the time
do you guys have an recomendations against the hunger
i have a bit of a problem  im already a little underweight 175 bmi i think but i have just like everyone else in my family as far as i can tell a bit of stomach fat that wont go away it makes me feel gross i hate it  i know theres no way to target any area and make fat go away but if i keep starving myself to the tune of one meal every other day will it eventually go away i gave up on running but i still walk at least 5k a day and drink a lot of tea i just want to not hate my body  i also have some therapists ill need to explain this to but that is a problem for future me
  post a pic
  i just follow this guy considering he also used intermittent fasting successfully for obese patients much easier habit to maintain as well since i basically started by skipping breakfast everyday giving me more time to sleep in the morning same thing with being too lazy to pack a lunch just move on to a 24 hour fast instead  
  herbal tea bone broth even just hot water change your mindset that fasting is like playing an idling game progress with no effort    black coffee and tea with caffeine in moderation obviously not a good idea to drink that all day consistently
mental health/dysmorphia general     im 63 and naturally pretty skinny ie i have an underweight bmi and skinny jeans are loose on my legs  why the hell do you aspire to be like this go seek therapy you fucking spergs slp heroinchic is a fucken old dead meme eat something and stop punishing yourselves through regimens of starvation and bodily abuse
  please be gentle
  looks like you have terrible posture which is most of the problem
  this is what im talking about   legit body dysmorphia its in your head mate do some crunches or sit ups if youre really bothered by it but really its totally fine as far as the general populace goes youre not fat by any measure
  do you really think so do i just need to straighten my back  either way i can poke the fat there and it bothers me

  pretty good looking guy maybe just lose a few pounds so your face looks more defined ignore the weirdly negative comments i didnt know people cyber bullied past middle school haha
  babbys first thinspo thread     yes we all have problems accept it or fuck off
  why are you even here
     holy fuck hes not even ugly what is this
  i think you look genuinely handsome im a big fan of slightly eccentriclispprogrammercore reminds me of cillian murphy for some reason even though you look quite different
    t twigs boutta snap
  damn you sure showed us
  sorry ive interrupted your delusional safe space     why ive finally decided to bite and post on a fucken thinspo thread is because im naturally slp heroinchic skinny/tall i dont particularly like my own body image and thus i dont understand why people would want to punish themselves to reach such a state ignoring the muscular fantasies of /fit/ spergs athletic/lean/healthy is what people should be aiming for these threads perpetuate unhealthy and unhinged behaviour dont address underlying mental health problems and so they deserve to be called our for it
  if you dont like your body image then do something about it thats what people here are doing  go eat a burger
    wow you really illuminated us with your profound idea that literally nobody else here has possibly considered here we were thinking we are all healthy well adjusted people doing the right thing you should really go to /fit/ and improve yourself and leave all of us pathetic people behind
  fuck its my sixth day of omad already sleeping warps my perception of time
  fuck off were not here to hear you preach go take your self righteous bullshit to reddit
  ik im ugly i believe you
  try one where you arent making that stupid fucking face
  eating healthily and adequately  exercise  starving yourself and engaging in selfdestructive behaviour to meet the contrived standards of the fashion industry or to find community amongst extremely selfconscious delusional teen/20 year old spergs   dont equate it       if you were really so selfaware youd modify your behaviour       god there is no better argument winner than the single solitary towering word that is reddit
current stats sex age height weight  male 23 174cm 62kg  tdee and your deficit  tdee around 1800 deficit pic related  highest and lowest weight  highest probably 78kg lowest 55  goal weight  when i wont have fat on me anymore  preferred method of losing weight  just cico    i finally weighed myself today after three weeks of losing weight and several months of gaining weight before that i fuck up every weekend because of drinking but overall im aiming to lose at least 2kg per month and i think its gonna work out
  people here are allergic to exercise it seems  even tho doing crunches  pushups doesnt make you muscular but gives lean muscle definition that looks way better than being skin and bones
  thinking about it this much is really really fucking stupid just eat 1 meal till you are full every day and you will lose weight it isnt fucking rocket science also only drink water
  people here are allergic to exercise it seems  its hard to exercise when youre eating way below your bmr
  that is because you have 0 fucking muscle wtf do you expect to poke your organs
  first off you shouldnt be eating way below your bmr especially if you are already at a normal bmi or less if you are already a healthy weight you should be eating 500cal deficit maximum  and no being at a 500cal deficit is not hard to functionmaybe if you have been lazy your whole life and have other shitty lifestyle choices
  youre not wrong but for most people here thats too slow its easier to just be at 1000cal deficit than to eat healthy and have to exercise in addition
  ya 1k deficit is easy when have have a bmi of 28 not when have you have a bmi of 22 better to have a sustainable diet that you can keep than something that wont last more than 5 days because it is bad for your body not to mention starving yourself is going to impair other aspects/responsibilities in your life
tfw been at my lowest weight in 4 years 76kg 62 thanks to if  tfw seeing someone i like in 20 days and going to water fast to lose the excess weight  tfw hope i hit 72kg or less  tfw just want those face gains
    this general irl
  canned tuna 100 cal  steamed broccoli corn peas filling and low cal  chicken and turkey cold cuts 50 cal per 4 slice  salad with carrots radishes cucumbers chicken breast whatever you have top with garlic balsamic vinaigrette literally just balsamic and olive oil watch how much oil you use  jello  berries  baked potato not very low cal but super filling
  comfy i only snort it desu too pussy to inject and too lazy to smoke it because that would involve going outside  its just very relaxing and blissful all my stresses are gone like im in a warm lovely blanket    speed really maybe was thinking doing mid sized doses of phenibut myself  im not a junkie at all i keep it in check which is actually more dangerous because it means my tolerance is low so if i get shit spiked with fentanyl im fucking dead  i thought it was meant to genuinely meant to be a appetite suppressant i mean heroin chic faggot are usually at least somewhat well off so its not that they cant afford to eat but that they dont want to
  phen is not an appetite supressent at all though it works a lot better if you fast before and during
  yeah  im not really considering to help me stop eating so much shit just to help with anxiety and to help me stop drinking

be me 20 year old lanklet  black hair slight tan  somewhat narrow frame  decently long neck  relatively long legs  shoe size 45 european    would this jacket look good on me what accesories should go with it
would this jacket look good on me  literally no way to tell unless you put it on took a picture posted it here  what accesories should go with it  a noose around your neck
  i mean assuming it fits you it would probably look fine    an easy fit would probably be black pants jeans/wool slacks/track pants and shoes that match turquoise    idk why youre asking for help with accessories that should be pretty obvious based on what you own a belt that matches the color of ur pants and maybe a shoulder bag if u dont feel gay enough yet
depressed birthday core
me turning 30 in a month  going to try my hardest to get alcohol poisoning
  turning 30 this month    my only regret was being a neet for 12 years im so socially retarded about a lot of things but luckily ive caught up and it no longer terrifies me to do average everyday stuff like driving
  i stopped celebrating my birthday years ago
  this  i literally stopped celebrating my birthday when i was 10  dont feel very /fa/ about it tho
  fuck you i can drive and go out in public but i have autism so i can never be normal
its my 28th today i would go without even remembering it except for that one person in my family who always reminds me i stopped celebrating it when i was a child and its never bothered me
  dumping
  ending with a classic greentext
stop stop this
please stop too close to home
  yo op where is this pic from i study at maastricht university
  maastricht heeft een universiteit  wajooo wist niet eens dat ze konden schrijven daar laat staan studeren
tfw dont have enough close friends to even have a depressed birthday party
  if ever i needed evidence that this earthly life is in fact hell this anons experience is convincing
birthday comes no one says happy birthday to me sits alone at home and crys thinking about how i have no friends and im only 20 years old
  the chocolate jesus of losers
  brutal
  truly hell is existence on earth
  that crooked frame possibly with motivational quote feels like a cherry on top of pie of sorrow and life disappointment
  pretty sure /b/ sent this guy a birthday card when they saw this
  lol still relevant a decade later
  this is how sissy tgirls are made
eating alone core
post more pics i want to see reality
  lol fake scar and eyepatch
  deleed dis
  literally me in 8th grade school dance     feels  ptsd
i turn 25 in february and ive realized more of my birthdays have been like this than i thought    my heart hurts you guys
dudes this thread hits a little too close to home
  do something about it anon start planning now have a job where you can get a vacation go somewhere even if its by yourself if thats not your speed start thinking about what youll do even if its close by to your home even if its the most simple thing you can think of that brings you joy you have time anon youre gonna make it
  thanks a lot anon i was just sorta roped into the habit of thinking theyre all bad i appreciate you its gonna be a good one this time
                  oh dear god please forgive me for all the evil deeds that ive done to deserve to live in this hell i beg of thee to have mercy upon my soul and deliver me from here   please help i cant i cant i just cant take this anymore   i cant see the light anywhere anymore i am in darkness lord please help me   please guide me towards light and happiness please   aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
    hey im turning 25 in february as well i havent had a proper birthday party since i became a teenager i used to get invited to all of the other kids birthdays parties and then i would invite them to mine that kinda just dried up and the only people who showed up were my brothers birthdays became something to dread rather than to anticipate    the only one who really gave a damn was my mom she would try her best to get me a nice cake and the snacks i used to like to try to make something of the day one time she forced my eldest brother and his girlfriend to come over to play mario kart with me because i guess she felt sorry for me playing by myself all the time it was kinda sad really because she wanted me to enjoy it but i couldnt be bothered to even try to give a damn or be grateful for the effort she put it in it must have been a miserable affair for everyone involved it must suck being a parent to someone with no friends their baseline emotion is apathy
  you should call your mom and thank her or just to say hi im sure she would appreciate it
  was gonna say this   call her
  looks chaddest between guys yeah this guy is probably chad now
  its peak depressed when it is just your parents  bonus if its just 1 parent
  a lot of the birthday pics itt arent so bad im 24 and ive spent a few birthdays with only my parents nothing to be ashamed of
its my birthday in a few hours thank you for this thread
i havent had a birthday party since i was 13 or so    30 now    depending which part of the world ive been in on the date its either going solo as was the case this year with my parents with a friend or two but no party shit or with a chick never mixing the above groups
my one friend turned 23 a week before my birthday so i gave him a card and some money when my birthday came he never said anything and passed out on my bed
  this i havent had a truly fun birthday since i was a little kid and every year i expect it to be different and awesome but its just depressing again i guess i should be grateful that i have few friends as opposed to none but usually when i try to put together something it feels like none of my friends are really that into it and like im being a burden to everyone else on my birthday birthdays suck
tfw always forget ppls birthday  if i remember or they tell me i always do something nice  one time i got some asian chad who used to be nice to me 10lbs of gummy worms  he got expelled by the end of the year tho    i often feel like a pay ppl not directly but sometimes just by doing things for them to be my friend  its a hard hard autism life     playing nintendo games with other people is max comfey
  haha goeie man
  wahhh look how bad i have it feel sorry for me
save money and do bunch of cocaine the only way to remember ur birthday
this thread is evil
birthday is in the middle of summer  no one is ever around for my birthday  always celebrate with family  its either on vacation or at the countryside with extended family  never felt the feels because every year is different  this summer on my birthday i was working as an intern at another country  had a much of shots with coworkers    seriously this has prevented me from so much pain
  thats me irl
  facebook its a guy from highschools wife
i dont celebrate my birthday i pretend its cuz i dont care but rly cuz its nobody wld come and it would hurt my selfesteem im 24 fuck ml i havent had friends or done shit for yrs
  hooking up is fun and all but its shallow the next day after they both part ways bowtie kid is going to go back to square one with the hope and despair that you can see in the eyes of eyepatch kid
birthday parties past the age of 13 lole  lole
  tfw semi neet for 4 years and this year i have to learn how to make friends and interact with people all over again  one day at a time one day at a time  i havent quite caught up yet but im worlds better than i was
  fuck me this hits hard
  bet his mum posted that on her fb page haha
this thread made me lol ive had a few of these but honestly now i just look back at them and laugh its not that hard to find friends there are hundreds or thousands of lonely people like us and they all want to connect just join an online community and go from there or go to a record store concert book store just say hi to people
  chad  npc  neurotypical
  i remember this exact feeling 
  there are hundreds or thousands of lonely people like us and they all want to connect    why would you want to hang around the thing that resembles what you hate the most
  because we want to love ourselves but are incapable of it so we overextend ourselves emotionally to other people but dont get back what we want or need or are willing to give out and we delude ourselves into thinking people like us will understand and be willing to reciprocate
  this hurts
  this is cute hope dale is doing good
mfw birthday falls on december 31st ive accepted being lonely i kinda like it
  dale is comfy
my girlfriend forgot my birthday and didnt do anything to make up for it
  dont worry she made it up to me bro
  just say hi to people  lol great advice dude
  not a good gf probably fugging another guy
  i love you man you can make friends its hard and it might hurt but you can find people if you look in the right places and are patient
  length of relationship how many days ago was it we didnt do anything special except start going raw that day thanks progesterone being the social outcast i was but appreciating company we had a couple of her friends over for the following weekend enjoying video games drinking and desert
  mum looks fucked up
it gets better  my family never celebrated christmas nor birthdays  my neet friends never cared for my birthday till i turned 18 and my gf started showering me in smoll gifts through the year and birthday gifts  she is a pure soul with so much love sometimes i feel like i dont do enough because i never was aware of gifts through my life
  have u tried it u fucking idiot
          birthdays stop being special after 10 you might get something at 16 18 and 21 due to being able to drive drink shit like that but no use in clinging to childhood idea of being the center of attention a lot of suck it up advice is thoughtless but in this case you guys really need to catch up with the reality that people have their own lives and shit going on you can only count on yourself to care and give attention to yourself next time your birthday comes around and nobody remembers but you celebrate another year of being alive having all your limbs senses and cognitive functions intact if you want to whine about how life is hard stop wasting everyones time including your own and open a couple of arteries in the shower if life was easy youd complain about that too
  beyond based and extremely redpilled
  have you been anywhere in public in the past 10 years do you think people randomly say high to eachother and start conversations all the time do you live in some backwater in kentucky because i cant otherwise understand how you would think living in a relevant city that people are interested in having conversations with strangers on their daily commute to wherever they are going
  a commute is very different hes talking about social situations absolutely zero surprise you didnt pick that up though
  this summer birthdays fucking suck
  fuck i feel this summer birthdays suck  my birthday is on july 4th when i was a little kid we used to have my couple friends over weeks before because we knew theyd be gone around my birthday  my little bro goes out of town every summer too im 20 and for the past 5 years ive spent it alone with my parents this year was mostly with my mom tho  my boyfriend didnt even wish me happy birthday and was off doing stuff with his friends shit stings
   happy late birthday anon i love u
  thank u anon luv you too appreciate it
  social situations  just say hi    you mean at a social function nobody walks up and says hi randomly even there they are introduced or organically generate rapport by joining their friends in group conversations with other people and their groups jesus what fantasy maladaptive day dreaming existence do you live i encourage you to actually try this yourself sometime since you clearly havent done it yet see how that works
  man saying hi to people and striking up convo is not that hard idk what either of you are on about unless its obvious the person isnt interested in talking body language is very important people are usually fine with talking and prefer it over just sitting by themselves talk to people what do you have to lose id talk to u guys
  yeah any situation in which there may be conversation between two human beings christ dude call it a function if you want way to get me im not living any kind of fantasy it is unbelievably easy to talk to people im not saying everyone is like that but nothing bad is going to happen to you if you approach someone and act friendly what  said about body language is important though dont approach someone that looks like they want to be left alone you can do it bud
wtf is this r9k shit
      you guys are sitting on extreme ends of something that has truth on either side on the one hand if youre at lets say a listening party for the release of a record they still happen in places i would not find it out of the question at all if someone complimented me on my band shirt and we started to have a conversation about music and shows we have been to just one example there are many possibilities where this is normal if not expected    on the other hand if you as the other guy are frequently going around social events striking up conversations with strangers you are absolutely an invasive burdensome presence and people are more often than not humoring you out of politeness because theres no tactful way to tell you this is weird or go away i have been at parties and events where my friends and i are talking and some rando starts trying to talk to me or us out of nowhere we give each other looks like whats up with this guy and are relieved when he goes away been to bars many times where a guy start talking to me out of nowhere but itd be rude to just turn my back and talk to my friend even if thats what i wanted to do in the moment
  this says a lot about our society
  whered u meet her
  this just looks like hes about to do some breakdance or something
my life is fucking shit and i want to die ive started smoking hopefully i dont live for too long i dont think i can endure this loneliness
  smoking isnt going to kill you that fast why dont you share whats going on
  i remember this thread we all sent him happy birthday wishes on facebook
  punished
  dont feel bad were here to give u the best birthday d
  haha looks at how he cuts the cake  everytime
i dread my birthday i spend it alone year after year its been that way since i was a young child just me and my parents its tradition that i come by their place to spend it with them im all they have and i wouldnt want to break their hearts by not showing up that being said once its done on the way home i cant help but feel miserable and break into tears     those who have the luxury of a proper birthday please cherish it theres nothing fun or effay about being a bitter lonely fuck and for that other anon in this thread  happy birthday
  thats so scute  lucky dale
  amen
  that doesnt looks depressing at all  try when nobody around remembers your birthday except you
  im 25 i dont have friends i cant make friends i cant enjoy socializing im always overthinking
  autism is normal fuck off
i dont think anybody wanted me at the last birthday i went to my own birthdays are lonely and every time that number goes up i expect something to be different but nothing really changes and thats the sad part    what was nice about my last birthday at least was that my boyfriend wrote me a letter just like the one he wrote me when he confessed to me we read it out loud together and it made me feel really special i guess the past 4 birthdays before that sucked but my last one wasnt
  good that you recognize overthinking as a problem because some people me in the past are prideful about their rationality their brains go lightspeed but they are so selfcentered they have no data to process you need to gather data instead of process data pay attention look outwards people will calibrate how you should feel about situations cause right now your calibration is way out of whack  start your day with exercises eat well sleep decent hours if your body is doing good itll significantly cut into the anxiety then maybe you can start being around people get the ball rolling its about momentum it takes about a year next birthday be proud of the progress youve made
tfw you genuinely forget your own age and have to google how old am i and use an age calculator  you end up being younger than you thought but still feel bad
  i still think im a teenager that was years ago
  c o p e
  what
  keep going anon youre an inspiration
  thats such a dale thing to do haha
  bout half of that is right
that communist uncle that sends you a communist birthday sms
what would you want someone to do for your bday anons  what would make you feel glad you were alive at least for the day and appreciate youve made it one more year
  idk just like tell me happy birthday spend time with me or something   like i dont want expensive gifts or loud parties i just like hanging out with people
  square one for chad isnt a bad spot the chase is rewarding definitely not disparaging with the right mindset im sure bowtie hooked up with multiple more girls before eyepatch got one
  stealing this for album cover
  just
  happy birthday anon
i stopped celebrating my birthdays when i turned 18 so i didnt have to remember being alone for them
my birthdays next week and im ridiculously nervous about it i dont really have close friends but i was thinking of inviting some people im friendly with to a bar or something but im nervous theyll decline i really wish birthdays werent such a big deal but theyre a yearly reminder that i have no social life
  how old are you turning
december 31st birthday  i had two normal birthday parties in my life
tfw going to spend my 21st birthday alone  at least ill be old enough to legally die from alcohol poisoning
i will turn 24 next month  im working full time in a big company its my first job after uni    last week one of the emplyees had birthday  everyone sang and hugged him but you could see how uncomfortable he and basically everyone else was im so fucking afraight of my birthday now i cant take the day off but i also dont think i can survive this shit im sweating heavily just by thinking about this having a lot of people you barely know and dont care about vice versa singing happy birthday to you and hugging you because its what you do in this company fuck i wish i could spend the day all by myself like i did since i was 18
  just hide in the bathroom for eight hours fuck dude office culture is the worst not just with birthdays but the entire social aspect in general how was your weekend/what are you doing this weekend nobody gives a fuck so why do you keep asking everyone katie why did you even bring your baby to show it off at this cesspool
  it literally doesnt saw anything about society
  fuck you veronica
  i swear i knew that polynesian kid
  around here we did half birthdays when that was the case
  how to fix low self esteem
  my birthday is the 5th spending it alone again this year
  damn this is sad on so many levels
  dddd
  what do i do when the momentum is interupted because i cant accept or believe that i will actually be happy even if i improve myself    like if im not ill poor injured disabled in fairly good condition and cant like myself or find happiness how do i convince myself to put in constant effort to improve when i cant even accept the status quo which is above average
  for me the thing that drives me or rather part of it is when im old and nearing death when i finally realise its happening soon will i be happy with what i did in life fear of being forgotten also drives me
  but i genuinely want to die my literal fear is growing old and realizing nothing anyone does matters and that i went through a horrible experience living a fake life
  we all want to die some of us even do be dead yeah imma try and kill myself and fail but not anymore its just an excuse find a fishing boat to force you out of the deep
  pls respond
  that hoodie is cool
  you are way overthinking it just banter through it and maybe go out for drinks after work
  it must suck being a parent to someone with no friends their baseline emotion is apathy  why does this suck its not like were costing them money or anything we still work and some of us can even fund their elder life if it sucks for them they should understand that its even worse for us
  my life feels worthless because other attractive guys have hooked up at least once im not ugly too which probably why i feel like i deserve a better life but im too fucked up to even have close friends too overthinking low self esteem socially anxious depressed angry etc    im always scared of not impressing people enough
  everyone has autism different degrees no doubt but you cant escape the tism
  i hate that feel but i see myself younger most of the time
  tfw every other normies are less white than you
i realized i dont know how to make friends i only had friends in highschool because i played sports and we were forced to spend time together went through college at a huge party school and made no friends now i work with nobody my own age still no friends and all my highschool friends are far far away
  its hard because i dont even sincerely want to talk to them i just feel comfortable with responding to their convos in my head and later fantasizing about how i would respond better to their banter its not even stressing me out anymore it feels like the default state of me
  sometimes i do listen but i just cant respond to them its like i cant even move my tongue i can only respond to them in my head fantasizing about how i can make them laugh especially those cute girls cus im really scared of being stupid and embarassing in front of them
  dont do it theyll judge you because they know that theyre not your close friends yet youre inviting them to a special occasion thats a bit pathetic id rather not celebrate at all
i dont like having birthday parties so i usually call a few friends and go out for a few beers
  same ive never really celebrated as i just had a cake at home either my parents and brother and got a few presents but that stopped after they forgot my 16th birdthday and during that day my parents even got to a fight same happened to my brothers birthday twice i have not blown any candles ever since because i just dont want to
birthday is on halloween  always went trickortreating on my birthday as a kid with my friends  spent rest of the night playing video games and eating candy  was comfy
  this triggered a memory from high school when i turned 16 and tried inviting casual friends to a birthday dinner and only 2 people showed up 
is iqos fa
  i dont know what that is but i thought pic related was a pregnancy test stick
  funny because using one of these is a guaranteed contraceptive
smells like feet popcorn
  you were almost there
  this    havent seen them in the us but when i was abroad earlier this year i could smell the stench 30 feet away
imagine the smell

  the wallet i got handmade in a tiny greek town from some old guy so youre out of luck there but the wood and silver knife is a laguiole 12 inch silver and olive wood
  isnt laguiole just the style of knife or is it a brand name too    speaking of which is opinel good or just a meme theyre surprisingly cheaper than i expected
  suorin drop  my nigga
  a friend bought one and it seemed pretty sturdy dont lnow much tho
  laguiole is just a style im not sure what exact maker mine is specifically  i got it from a vendor in the province and its not clearly marked anywhere not to familiar with opinel so couldnt tell you honesty as long as its handmade and in the 150 range youre sure getting something around the 150 range and made in france youre good
  is that a good my nigga or a bad my nigga

  humans have been edcing knives for as long as they have existed the knife was among the first if not the first tool man made
  why carry such a big revolver then    wouldnt you rather have almost 20 shots of p 9mm out of a glock 17/34 or even a cz75 shadow 2 or a beretta 92    hell if you feel like carry something that powerful get a 357 sig or 10mm block
  first shot damage even 9mm takes time between shots whereas in a big frame revolver one shot will have a high probability to hit something important due to fragmentation instead if 3 shots with moderate chance through straight channels

  i dont know how to read
  wearing cargo pants   ever
  looking good  cosplay
    the shirts wrong doesnt match at all
  its a meme you dip
  the joke      outer space      the atmosphere      your head
as a young man how do i dress in a classic way without looking cringy and unattractive
classic how or classy
  as in traditional and elegant but not formal
  its close to impossible because the style is simply dated many girls i know prefer sneakers to leather shoes jeans to dress pants the perception of whats stylish changes
post what you consider classy as for attracting girls this is the fashion board not the howtodresslikeanotineptperson board
  the style can work but you basically have to be masculine as fuck or 30    the problem is young nerds are going to look like young nerds no matter what they wear so they mayswell go for a fashion style that is basically hot nerd rather than nerd trying too hard
  what if you are a nonnerdy pretty boy
  it is possible quite easy actually  what to do  1 never overdress dont go in suits to school  2 dont do personal touches that arent actually classical theres a reason no one wears red dress shirts and black suits outside of funerals  3 get in situations where you can dress formal get a job in finance or lawyer so you can wear suits here in the netherlands we have corps which is basically a student society where you show up in suits and dresses  4 basically point 2 again but dress in actual classic clothing and not meme shit like jeans with vests and what not read literature about classic menswear do it right dont fuck it up  5 there are a lot of classic styles that work casually   my personal favourite prep british country a bit like  riviera style etc find something you like
  now some inspo
  similar to these  
  its quite simple really  dont be fat  dont be a lanklet or skinny  be muscular/athletic    most of this  distress your shit a bit  muted color palettes
i dont know how to use buttondowns it either looks either too casual with all those silly patterns or too office or menswear or something a clubbro would would wear plain white ones make me look like a waiter i cant find any model and color that doesnt ends in one of these categories  what should i do
what should i do  no idea this is the exact same reason why i never wear them i just dont know when to tuck them in or not etc
lift
jesus christ that image
get heavy cotton solid colors  wear them buttoned up and untucked with the top button undone
  can i misuse your image as meme op
they look like shit if your face is fat and youve buttoned to the top either remove 1 of two or try express different cuts for different sizes
jack
i used to plugdj with you
i thought you werent supposed to tuck casual shirts
  dont full button unless you are gay or ftm  dont tuck unless you are wearing a suit  if you have to do white dont wear black pants
      thats not me by the way its an old as fuck pic i had on my folder
  you are unless you are a zoomer bitch    im sorry but you are probably retarded  what you do   always tuck unless wearing shorts  wear actual casual shirts oxford cloth and button down collars make sure the collar is 32 inches besides oxford shirts plaid shirts tattersall gingham etc  wear good outfits  dont listen to zoomers who tell you not to tuck it will fuck up your proportions completely  good brands drakes brooks brothers mercer and sons piers and mackay prl sometimes kamakurashirts viyella cordings    also how the fuck can you not wear shirts did your parents never raise you
  also forgot to add dont button the top button dont fall for the supertailored meme do that only on business shirts since it is uncomfortable
  almost no one uses shirts here unless its required for their job or some event where you need to dress up certainly not people under 30
  damn you must live in a shithole
  it is
  unbutton it completely and toss a white tee underneath
  ultimate mfa soi look
  no  go away
  stop wasting your money on clothes and get a gym membership
roll your sleeves up for a less dressy look  only do the top button if you have a tie on  tuck/untuck based on shape most of the time    youre probably just a bit self conscious about wearing a shirt when everyone else has a tshirt or something similar its fine you probably dont look as out of place as you think
  mfa tier śoyboy advice
23 m nyc  im really bored of the old jeans/chinos/khakis/slacks polo/button down/tee/sweater for mens fashion womens fashion has a lot more dynamic range when i look at attempts to make heterodox mens fashion its abominable garish ostentatious its a ghillie suit of goose feathers its a pink latex body suit is there no reasonable middle ground what recommendations do you have for a young guy trying to spice up his fashion
  polo/button down/tee/sweater   jeans/chinos/khakis/slack    the reasonable middle ground is just using these options more uniquely fabric fit and color are all points of variance also outerwear  shoes are a nice way to spice things up because they can be mixed with many outfits with ease changing the formality or informality in interesting ways
i dont know what to tell you man you posted a picture of alt right neets so basically you just cherry picked the most inept autismo reddit group you could think of maybe give the rest of the nonretarded male population more benefit of the doubt
women have more clothes  is there a dumber tranny meme than that
  mens fashion is so much more interesting than womens fashion    stop looking at npcs and look at people that are actually interested in fashion
  this

  what a bunch of fucking cringelords
  its not really that boring mens fashion is mixing female influence and male influence from different cultures and its pretty good
go wear a dress then gay boy

  right wingers are pretty well dressed in history  richy spency is a fucking meme
  holy fuck is that actually a picture of contra pretransition    he was fucking hot
  cannot into hyperbole and exaggeration to highlight a point  cannot into the fact that as far as hyperbole and exaggeration go the example is not even that farfetched since whats depicted is the range of standard menswear in employment education and training  cannot into the possibility that im making fun of the autkikes  i dont have a microcephalic wojak stupidlooking enough to apply to your idiocy    well lets take just shoes as an example a woman can wear strappy gladiator sandals platform boots or stilettos and still be acceptable men dont have the same range of acceptable footwear but women can now wear mens footwear and be relatively fashionable    i would if i could but seriously some male dresses are pretty /fa/       bruce jenner and john walker flynt werent badlooking either
  wtf this nigga looks like a pussy slayer
  look at people that are actually interested in fashion  are you going to point some out for me thanks    show me da way    aesthetic     pic related    try korean brands  any thoughts on this
you def have more options in colder climate for mens fashion
  biting this hard
men do not worry about their appearances it is considered vain unimportant feminine looking smart and professional is no longer stressed and if it is men with no individual taste or experience flock to the uniforms of their peers whether it is a suit and tie or a polo and chinos they wear what they think they are supposed to look like
  in europe we can find strong masculine silhouettes functional formal wear with thick durable and often weather resistant materials wool that can stand to be dirtied and washed many times over leather that will scuff and crust polish and shine for decades to come coats that will withstand winters and keep the wearer and their underclothes dry when responsibility demands that they head out in the worst of weather
  recently asian fashion has been experimenting more and more with the abandonment of conventional silhouettes but they still have traditional menswear interestingly we see the continued experimentation with androdyny inspired by the likes of kiss and david bowie popularized in the east by visual kei and brought back to us through designer like rei kawakubo in the 80s and 90s slowly but steadily the perceived femininity of fashion is dispelled and men reclaim the appearance of status wealth competence and individuality through what they wear
  but you are actually pic related dont lie to yourself
  tasteful mens fashion is out there and not only in formal wear but fast fashion brands rarely push these styles to the general population because there is no demand while interesting and creative mens fashion ideas are constantly being produced they are not being made accessible to the general public    the major obstacle we face is that men do not care about what they look like and if they do it is for dishonest means i want women so i will wear the costume of a man a woman desires i want to look professional so i will wear the costume of a business man it is enough for fashion brands to sell cheap suits and dress shirts when their customers have no individual tastes and will accept whatever they have been told looks right without actually deciding it for themselves

  this reminds me of one of my friends a long time ago we were talking and he mentioned something along the lines of i wish capes were still in fashion    and i proceeded to show him somewhere around 510 examples of capes and capelike features that were showcased or played with by designers within the past few years and he responded that he meant in fashion but also socially acceptable    there is that constant societal perception of who can pull off what looks but honestly theres so much weird messed up and bizarre stuff in the public sphere these days that i feel like if you wanna wear a damned cape thats the least of societys problems if you wear your unconventional fit with confidence and its actually an interesting and functional piece people might think it actually works well and thats just trendsetting    mind you this is also a friend whose regular outfit consists of graphic tees and cargo shorts and he thinks turning that tee into a polo is dressing up so i dont know what exactly he had in mind

its liberalisms and socialisms fault for twisting the male ideal to the working and average man instead of dressing to display wealth power and taste     pre 1789 there was nobility and monarchies who dressed to impress each other and the commoners the growing burgher class however dressed in black and white and in a more professional and uniform look   as monarchies started to idealize the soldierking from charles xii and napoleon the flamboyant noble fell out of favor still the military uniform is what is considered formal wear for monarchs     the average person however especially in america learned to hate elitism and the upper classes and idealize the uneducated factory worker who doesnt care for fashion or dressing up     so now men only get to choose from jeans and pants with varying loose and slim fits shirts sweaters and hoodies and caring any more than that makes you feminine     gangsta culture is closest to the nobility in taste but due to lowclass background isnt considered tasteful flaunting wealth with screaming brandwear and jewelry     the true upper class wear conservative designer suits and formal clothes because flaunting your wealth is in poor taste due to ideas of social equality
  that guy with the swastika flag is a known antifa plant he is in several photos with antifa and his flag was clearly taken out of the package that day he is there to make good people look bad
  liberalism and socialism
  first guy on right looking masculine and comfy

man all these japanese examples suck goth died a long ass time ago and the earth is too hot for all that layering  i know japs have better unisex fits but im too lazy to search  interesting thread nonetheless and i agree with the sentiment male fashion is very limited
  he should have been kicked out then for carrying a nazi flag
based and reactionarypilled
  living somewhere hot  minorities arent effay ugh
  you probably think williamsburg is /fa/    interesting i was looking at the art thread and thinking i could rock this in a different fit    as opposed to conservatism and reactionism    polluting the planet with airconditioning just to be /fa/shionable in the global south    does anyone know who he is the nsm guys were of all the people doxxed
can we get a thread about /effay/ winter jackets that will actually keep you warm in 15f weather    not /effay/ larping winter real winter
coat/jacket threads never get any traction it seems
  this jacket is really good i just got one this weekend i actually use it as a blanket when i sleep because its warmer than my comforter the silhouette is p fucked though because its really boxy around the arms
this its finally hitting the 50s farenheit in la  bout to die need some serious coat suggestions
  15f  literally an undershirt and a hoodie
  edgy man wow
i want a duffel coat so fuckin bad man
  know of any good ones im looking for a replacement for my old one i want one that has cotton sleeve and collar inserts basically i want to look like a hokkaido school boy
  fuck i meant wool
where can i find a poorperson version of this coat
  can anyone recommend any cheaper parkas below 300 everything in the uk is so fucking expensive i just found out a canada goose coat would cost 100 less in america and 300 less in canada
  thrift stores
  want it now
  its one of the most expensive garment while making it cool is retardedly hard
  after a celebrity wears something zara and hm and f21 all battle to get it to market first  that literally needs to go in the sticky lol
  that guy isnt a celebrity though its just some dude
  arktis avenger coat  very versatile an absolute no brainer
  being this new
does anyone else look fat as fuck in a parka my shoulder blades and upper spine make it look like i gained 40 pounds from the side any fix do tailors work
even if its not machiavelli is it still worth purchasing and wearing out in public
thinking about this jacket not sure if the leather/duffle combo works
  i can tell you right now that will be annoying as fuck in actual winter or even a slight breeze the wind will get in under the coat and you will be cold this is due to the way the jacket is kept closed  it also looks like shit in case you were wondering
im usually not into conservative menswear but black coats are my fetish
  looks like a slop of shit
  quite sure he was part of one of the biggest boy bands of the 2010s
  nah it looks too thin and generic and also doesnt have fur/faux fur on it
  its only gonna get more expensive too
  where to buy
  absolute slop
just copped did i fuck up if so what are some nice militaryinspired alternatives that arent literally surplus i have enough surplus shit  inb4 zara
  toneddown outdoors/mountaineering recs also fit my style
  wtf since when zara puts their brandname on their garments
  hokkaido wool boy haha
  doesnt work at all
  most of the coats posted wont help at all in 15f temps for affordability and quality my first choice are ll bean or lands end fuck effay when your life is on the line because it is at 15f they actually test to temperature requirements and rank their coats by temperature category affordable prices too save effay shit for the club or your boifriends house
copping this
  save effay shit for the club or your boifriends house  posts on /fa/
  essential loser core why does everyone with one of these a total larp fag
  since they released a collection that actually looks acceptable and is somewhat original
  15f is not arctic temps you dont have to be dressed as a ball of fluff and down most of the coats in this thread will be fine with appropriate layers    for example  with hat and two warm layers would be fine for most people
  boy bands in 2010s    are you joking i cant even tell whoever the guy is he isnt famous or id know who he is
        zara forcing their slave children to make garments based off of nations who colonized them  the irony in this is fucking hilarious and based
  while your opinion is widely accepted in /fa/ it is far from truth that jacket is 100 cotton with 100 cotton lining you need at least 3 layers while walking or jogging to feel somewhat endurable in that jacket on 15f one underlayer one long sleeved t shirt one goose down jacket or military polyester fleece hoodie essentially cotton jacket does nothing much while really constricting movement being heavy but effay
  what is this
  some of the garments are made in romania others in indonesia from what i saw
  it blocks wind better than knitwear and by two warm layers i meant layers that add warmth so what you said since baselayer normally wont count
  i live in northern europe not far from the place where the lowest temperature in europe was recorded ill need it
    ll bean    i recently got the ll bean maine warden parka has been solid enough to just wear a tshirt in 20f weather goretex exterior and a ton of pockets really good for 369 and they often have 2025 off sales

  the sherling version should do the trick
looks comfy af
what im currently wearing now
  how do you get your hair like that hes using some kind of product right
   knockoff bedale  you can keep that
i have a question /fa/ can a tailor remove this stupid af edge to pockets
are geographical norway any good
  just buy actual milsurp
  1112  great logic    essentially what i said is cotton parka sucks so much that you need goose down jacket anyway    you clearly didnt experience 15f climate with severe siberian wind or heavy snow they are free bonuses not an anomaly so your opinions dont matter anyway
its not /fa/ in the slightest but in colorado i wore one of those north face style jackets that all the basic bitches wear it took a second to warm up but it kept me warm in 7f with just a tshirt underneath i know they look boring but it was a fucking kickass jacket
  but it kept me warm in 7f with just a tshirt underneath  this is the biggest bullshit ive read today
  oh okay
which alpha industries should i cop i already have a n2b shortwaist parka just getting one of these two for less extreme weather
    the chest patch on this one is removable the fur lining is removable in the first one
what are some quality but under the radar brands for jackets/coats
  id get this one my neck got cold when i wore their flight jacket

m70 ventile custom sizing
  1 asking what this is
  harry styles is pretty fucking famous man
pic is formatted stupid but i got this a couple weeks ago it hasnt gotten colder than 25 here but it kept me nice and warm
  dry with no wind is tolerable enough that you dont need a lot  i live by one of the great lakes and the wind/humidity cut through your jacket till you can feel your organs shut down lol  i have an ecwcs l7 try to avoid active duty people so they dont think im a poser but its so god damn warm i really dont care
  gloverall      vintage stores usually have lots of these jackets         its and overcoat with a puffa/down collar insert lots of hugo boss overcoats used to have these a few years back just buy a uniqlo packable down jacket and wear it under an overcoat if you want the look      you fucked up should have bought a uniqlo seamless down jacket instead        these look good      awful      i bought this one from a thrift store a while back its decent      i wouldnt buy a bomber with an integrated hood
my hiking jacket broke how about this one
  lmao he was one of the members of one direction and if you havent heard of one direction then you are far from an authority on who is and isnt a celebrity
  cant go wrong with a north face parka
  too expensive here ive found out from a friend in canada theyre roughly 160 less when converted in to our currency and they also have newer versions of their parkas we dont get is there a reason companies seem to just ignore this dismal little island
had a military surplus n3b from a relative that worked in rammsteins military base when i was a kid and id like to get one dont know the brand or maker of the old one but it was the comfiest coat i remember    eurofag here so i cant go the surplus route what options do i have alpha has a shitload of shapes and im not sure which one should i get besides i remember the hood having a lot less fur than current ones
  if youre gonna get a fleece id recommend getting a vintage one off ebay from northface or patagonia or one of the new retro styled ones they sell if it matches your style looks a little less white girly and will sometimes have a more interesting cut then an average fleece jacket fleeces arent that warm on their own though and usually need a lot of layering
  just wear a hoodie/sweater lol its not that cold
nah its 50 rn freezing my peen off bruh
  w2c
  oh im not looking for one i was just suggesting it because the guy was talking about 15 degree siberian winds i moved to the south where it might get that cold once a year
    
a few people said i look like a hooligan with this jacket but i dont think so
  get scandinavian or german surplus
  someone gifted me a similar coat and i like how it looks but every time i look in the mirror i feel like a matrix reject makes me sad
  mate who cares what you wear as long as you like it
  and 300 less in canada  still overpriced shit in canada but i guess that would explain why it feels like a quarter of the people in toronto wear canada goose
  ebay actually
  w2c shirt
the best of all parkas
  what is it link
 not op but 66 north jokla jacket  
    damn thanks but thats out of my price range lol
  german parkas have negative connotations here ie used by neonazis and scandinavian are hard to track id had to order without trying sizes     i just wanted to know if theres a different brand than alpha that did military n3bs in the 80s ill check in militaria forums
  used by neonazis  negative  i dont understand
  ewwww every chav owns this shit
  original op that posted the pic    i deff know what you mean i saving up to get one their other garments are really worth it     i have their lambswool sweater and it is the best sweater i have had think of it as an investment piece that will last you years
  i prefer the blue i think it has a good urban vibe to it looks pretty good
     i have a coat very similar to this in my basement ive always wanted to wear it but never thought it would look good could i unironically wear this without looking like im just wearing my parents old 80s hippie coats  also what would i wear it with this guy is wearing it with a hoodie and jeans and i dont really love that look
bumping for wool
anyone got a woolrich coat thoughts
  makes me feel rad

  trench coat for work  blazing orange for everything else baby    been wearing this coat for more than a decade i get so many mires
  heh i was considering getting a orange work jacket for midseason
  been wearing this coat for more than a decade  dont confuse attention with admiration
  oh believe me theres no confusion    confidence is fashionable my friend and nothing says confidence like shouting the color bright orange at people    like this image i know it was hard to ignore the sexy man in cargo pants but that coat is the true /fa/ hero
  looks like fun
  is this bait
  trench coat for work  thats not a trench coat
  nah i mean i have another winter coat a trench coat for work itd be obnoxious to go to work in something that would melt other peoples eyeballs
everyones thinking too hard  just buy a triple fat 400600 dollars and of comparable or better quality than high end jackets that are priced at twice the amount    saves money looks good warm as shit i know you wont be able to tell your friends that you spent a gorillion vietnamese bottlecaps in order to buy it but im sure you can live without having to
  too many rugs
  i want to buy their stuff but their name is too retarded lmao
  absolutely love this jacket but i could never justify the price while being a student my cobbler has a really really similar one from the 80s and his vintage one looks dope   inb4 some shithead says that its just a shearling coat his is basically scary close to those colours cut and everything    could look good could be warm but could probably also be shit    absolut beauty love the ian

  and it is definitely a warm jacket btw
fuck off now i want to spend 1k on a hard shell
thinking about getting pic related
  you dont want this unless youre trekking through snow in arctic conditions wearing this in the city would be overkill the nylon is extremely crunchy and noisy
  i live in atlantic canada we had heavy snow and wind throughout november in the winter it can get to 40 celsiusthis is the best i know
most rednecks wear choco racing coats which looks like the nascar version of a snowmobile coat
here
  people wear this and canada goose in nyc all the time because they wear this  just a tshirt or light sweater under it being overkill is a good thing especially when they blast the heat indoors you dont wan to be caught in 4 layers when its 80 degrees inside
  you should get shot in the abdomen shortly after buying it
  fatal abdomen wounds are the most effay way to die
  whats so bad about it
  i work for carhartt and can get this for anyone half off
  buy it and post pictures wearing it to find out
  hmu senpai
  id have to ask corporate if i am able to do this i wouldnt be charging anything more than what i paid plus shipping so its not like i would be making a profit ill find out by tomorrow
  where
  it looks like garbage if you arent tall and have the shoulder width for it also if it isnt absolutely tailored to your body it looks trash and even then it leans slightly too much into costume territory
  fuck corporate bro package that bad boy up and ship it
  i have no problem with doing one order but if multiple people want i dont want to do anything that could get me in trouble they are a great company to work for
  tell them its improving their online presence     dont tell them its an online chinese anime forum
which brand is best  the north face  patagonia   canada goose  moncler  moose knuckle  nobis   parajumpers   arcteryx  stone island  carhartt   alpha industries   fjallraven
    not effay
  trust me i wasnt going to do that
  anyone know what this coat is
  out of those north face wouldnt be caught dead in any of the others
  tnf is like half good shit particularly the heavy coats junya watanabe collab and early supreme collabs half basic meme shit denali jackets worn by middle school through college basic bitches everywhere newer supreme collabs
i wish it wasnt 1800
      nah hes right that pic was actually nearly a decade ago and i was already approaching 30 im middleaged now with coats    have another coat suggestion from 18yearold me nothing wrong with basic and tough if it makes you feel warm and confident
    i own an air force snowmobile coat just like that youre speaking the truth
  canada goose
  ofc but surely you approve that under 10c negative ops 15f doesnt actually recuire more than a basic jacket and a layer or two
  i feel like a bomber is simply too short for when it gets really fucking cold outside
  it is although you can wear baselayer pants but a longer jacket is a better idea for sure
bought this nearly 10 years ago and its still my favourite thing i look forward to every winter a nice winter jacket is one thing you can afford to spend money on get something nice that will last
  im not him but a lot of people in temperate climates dont seem to understand that 10 celcius isnt close to the worst of it its the 20 with wind chill that make it feel like 35 and you better pray that theres no moisture anywhere on exposed skin that seems like far out arctic tier conditions but theres at least a dozen or more days in winter with those kinds of conditions on the east coast of the us
  look up canadagoose on instagram for shits n giggles  entire page is almost entirely japs or extreme antifur vegans
how you get the job id love to work for a clothing company i have no job right now

  how much
  kapital ring coat
  lol you dont have a comforter why you lyin on the innernet
  literally just put on a hat and scarf if you really are struggling and need arctic level gear you might not be healthy yes im aware of the wind yes im aware that moisture/sweat can be a killer     a decent shell 2 warm layers long underwear gloves hat scarf and you should be fine down to 15f and below even with wind ill go even further and say that would keep the average man warm lying still on the ground
i desperately want to cop this blade runner 2049coat for winter  how to pull it of without looking neckbeardcore or tryhard core  im broad shouldered 63 tall and want to wear it with fitted black pullovers or dress shirts and slim fit black trousers/w boots ideas
  are you friends with spiral people
  are you as hot as ryan gosling
  are you fat  if you are dont buy it  are you thin but well built  consider it  do you live in a place with permanent winter  consider it  are you 25 years old  if you are dont buy it  do you hunt replicants for a living in 2049  buy it    all jokes aside if you buy it dont pull the lapels up like in the movie unless you want to shoot up a shopping mall
  are you fat  if you are dont buy it  need to loose about 10kg to be dreamweight/bmi of 20  are you thin but well built  consider it  working on it  do you live in a place with permanent winter  consider it  meh but pretty cold from autumn to spring  are you 25 years old  if you are dont buy it  check  do you hunt replicants for a living in 2049  buy it  will probably in 15 years    i think thats a go    mfw when im not a robot
the key to staying warm is layering the austrian m65 is plenty good enough for north american winters theres a flap that buttons over the zipper for extra wind protection     synthetic/wool undershirt  wool sweater  m65
    fuck those are expensive i am down with paying like 200 dollars for a coat or a bit more but a kapital wool ring coat goes for 600 to 800 dollars are there any affordable alternatives
  these are sick the haters dont know that its an og french canadian parka brand
  need to loose about 10kg to be dreamweight/bmi of 20  bmi20  dreamweight  nno
  i would very much like one for half off thank you
      i guess this is redneck then huh kids
  dont get wool as your outmost layer of defence its not practical and heavy no wonder that no outdoor brand use it get a waterproof down jacket/coat between 200300 dollars you can get good enough down jackets      the key to staying warm is layering  thats what i thought until i bought my first cold weather down jacket those act like a stove no need for layering often you can wear just a t shirt under and you wont be cold or a thin sweater fleece if you want something almost equally as good but cheaper look for columbia jackets with omniheat reflective
  id like one too was planning on buying it
  this its just like  says we here in the north know that indoors is a furnace so if you layer you go from 5stacks in 20 to 5stack in 75 and no hangers no locker for the 3 people you dressed into    a good winter coat one you wear in winter not work in winter does its job thoroughly warm without help and weather preventative
      send me an email greentextnewfagaolcom my 50 doesnt just limit to that coat if anyone is wondering why im doing this i just feel like giving back in some way my family is usually the only people taking advantage of my discount
  yeah but down jackets are ugly all the boomers wear them
  aol
  i made it just for this
  looks like a knockoff napapijri
  sent you an email senpai
  arcteryx  the velience line that is
  dont get wool as your outmost layer of defence its not practical and heavy no wonder that no outdoor brand use it get a waterproof down jacket/coat between 200300 dollars you can get good enough down jackets    is this true what about pants shouldnt you wear wool pants in winter
  what is this beautiful piece
seriously considering buying this but its 370 eurobucks and im a poorfag 100 percent wool said to be warm as well as wind and water resistant oh well

  i like moncler never been too cold in mine      if its really fucking cold you need some thicker pants anyway ive always felt longer coats get too bulky
  its a leidse zeeduffel made by the biesot company which is a very small dutch nautical fashion brand my uncle swears by it
  i just go full nude when its cold
  under 20 is considered underweight espec if you have a considerable amount of muscle fuck of twig twink
is it worth its money
just bought a patagonia jacket anons ready to hit peak normie and attract some wannabe outdoors girls
  polyester fleece pants are warmest you can also wear fleece bonded jeans  if you deviates from this you need a baselayer long johns      marmot is a good brand not overpriced and popular like patagonia but works well anyway
  fleece is not wind resistant and cannot deal with moisture fucking dumb idea for winter pants
  he doesnt know who harry styles is    pff get a load of this guy
whats something good in the 100200 dollar range in terms of longlasting and warmth    im looking at columbia carhartt wip uniqlo right now
  youre gonna have to go over 200 for most carhartt wip jackets
  id go up to 300 then my mistake
    but its going to cost you a pretty penny
is 5c cold enough for a winter jacket
  100 less then 1400 is not that much8
heres the secret to coats that coat you want that is wool mix and hundreds of dollars is garbage compared to the 20 secondhand one some dude wore three times  unless you are paying big money for new you are buying garbage all the reasonably priced stuff is cheaping out on you somewhere
  that coat you want that is wool mix and hundreds of dollars is garbage  that is why my coat is 3 layer goretex pro i pay for the material construction quality and style
  would you say its usually what youre wearing    no best u could do is sew a fflap and even thats tricky
can you guys be honest with me on this one i think it looks clean if i had some black jeans with it
  probably also has to do with the fact that the company is actually based in toronto
  looks cool but you need to be the right type of person
  what do you mean by that you mean just by being generally attractive and slim or certain personality
  both
  cloud rappa lookin sadboi  you cant look like john mcprep and pull it off  a little gothy maybe  idk
  yeah it can run pretty big if youre shorter like i am should try it on in store if you have the chance

  no it could absolutely be pulled off i like the look of the fur a lot got a link or anything

hey /fa/ im in need of a winter coat for work i like the one in this picture but dont know what id search for to find one like it what is it called
sure let me just tap into my endless database that can recognize any piece of obscure clothing from a low quality black and white image of a director forty years ago
  not that coat specifically but the type of coat
  its called a jacket hope i could help
  go to outdoor clothing stores webpage and search until you find one that looks like that for example  
  thanks for the reply but those are far too expensive and fancy
  i know      those are way cheaper and are more similar
is cultural appropriation /fa/

  isnt she italian 
        go back to black twitter with this lame activism shit no one cares nigger
cultural appropriation doesnt fucking exist you mongoloid
  the only people who think that italians are white are racist italians
  when choosing between white black or asian id have to say italians are pretty white you fucking dumbass exclusionist
  white black and asian the three ethnicities
  white black or asian  american education everyone
  yes
  black oriole gave embraces the canadian tuxedo
  if you get down on me ill get down on you
  i still cant find a good explanation for native americans some say is the mix of asian and black ok that sort of makes sense but problem is they dont have black features only the tan skin could be considered a resemblance i have never seen an native american with afro hair or with a really black skin color etc etc for examble in brazil you can clearly see when someone has afro mix even when hes got tan skin color
  maybe this will help burger
  argentina white    when will the meme end
  nah but id shot that club up
  gonna make you cum tonight  over to my house
  theyre as white as italians spaniards and greeks only partially
  people born in the arctic circle are grey
  no data
  italians only started getting referred to as white because all the pasty anglo boys were mad that the swarthy beautiful mediterranean men were making their women wet
  i was genuinely surprised at how wrong you were able to make this statement good job you retarded faggot
      for gods sake  red hair is obviously not her natural color  pic comparison is not being honest by picking a pic with very strong lighting and no tan and pic with strong tan and without strong direct lighting  she was dark skinned dark haired brown eyed mutt to begin with stop treating her like shes white
  t butthurt anglo boi who got his girl stolen by pietro dinatale

  br
  stay mad burger 56
    supposedly shes 50 sicilian 50 abruzzese so shes a terroni     terroni are strange in the sense that some will be extremely fair and pale while others will be golden brown year round     for me personally im 100 italian but from different regions namely liguria campania sicily and basilicata im as pale as a ghost and have greenish hazel eyes but cousins of mine who are more southern or sicilian both have darker features or lighter features     italians and their descendants are weird   i remember in elementary school someone told me theres no way i can be italian because i didnt have brown eyes and tan skin
she would look a lot better without that cartoonish ponytail literally any other hairstyle would be an improvement
  no fun
  nah just the consequences of postcolonialism
  she would look a lot better without that cartoonish ponytail  at this point its become her brand and she does rock it often   although she looks so adorable with it down
  what the fuck is rihanna thinking
  blacks and hispanics living in white countries and pretending to be citizens of those countries is cultural appropriation on the scale of a racial invasion    but tell me more about outfits

  america is not even white    america invaded native american lands and they killed a lot of innocent people  americans living in hispanic territories by stealing mexicos more than the half of their territory    that is cultural appropriation on the scale of a racial invasion
  it doesnt matter even with that shitty outfit she looks hot and i would fuck her black pussy and slam that black fat ass

be kid early 2000s   get a hand me down bi fold wallet from family  black leather smelled amazing  took it with me everywhere for a decade and a half  ff to today the wallet has conformed to the shape of my leg from being in my pocket so much  holes in the bottoms  doesnt hold cards or id securely  every time i open it i risk losing something important if i am not paying attention  resort to using a money clip    as much as i want to keep my old one it needs to be retired any recommendations for a bi fold wallet or even a trifold if it matters dont need anything fancy but an id window would be nice
 a smaller non folding wallet will generally last much longer but ithe most important thing is leather quality go to a department store and pick out whichever feels the nicest i got mine from tk maxx and its actually pretty nice and was only 15       its made by partridge
  make sure its got velcro  
  theres nothing cooler than a velcro wallet
want something slim fit that sits at the waist    levis 606 here  
wrangler 936
  how do 606 levis compare with the 511s a little looser or tighter
  606 sit on your waist rather than below it    wranglers are fucking ugly
    
  maybe try squatting so you have less soiboi legs and can fit into regular fits that have high waists
  i have small feet so the regular pants widths wouldnt work they would make the feet look even smaller rather than something like a slimstraight or slim cut
  second one looks nice but not a huge fan of the color
are chelsea boots gay
  yesh  mfw mindslave chelsea boot wearers are slowly changing to cowboy boots which are also gay
  if paired with skinny jeans yes
black ones are acceptable but brown ones are absolutely onions
  yes
  only if you suck dicks
  theyre only acceptable if your an ausfag things are different down there
  never saw a man wearing a pair
being this insecure
  what kind of inbred shithole do you live in where not only have you never seen a man wearing chelsea boots but youre also incapable of differentiating between saw and seen
  uhhhhh  he used saw correctly  never saw  havent seen  retard
hedi boys quaking

are your parents effay  mine are and i just realised how much it helped me with creating a style and with dressing well while younger
  are your parents effay  ño
  how do they dress    i also like seeing family pics of families that are all effay if you are a parent you should help your kid dress imo
    you cant get whiter than this
r8 my mummys fit
i would say for the most part yes
  and thats a good thing  but besides that black people adopted like miles davis adpoted prep too for a short while
  this even scandinavians dont look as white as they do
  sneakers on old people  jeans on old people  should not be allowed    post also in what style they dress  my dad dresses really basic but always clean cut now in winter wool trousers black/gray or brown cords with some random shirt and random vneck sweater i genuinely he picks them at random blus crockett and jones derbies  my mom dresses in all kinds of designer im really foreign in the world of womens designer fashoin though wool coats shetland sweater or cashmere cable knits and grey or black skirt
  old people    rrude
  10/10 would make love to birth another autist
    cant believe how people who dress as nice as this turned out to be so shitty
  should no be allowed  the ultimate authority on everything style related has spoken  kill yourself faggot
  my dad dresses like a typical dad regular fit polos that he buys a size too big so theyre always loose on him regular fit calvin klein or levis jeans with the bottoms rolled up costco reeboks or what you would say are typical dad sneakers    for work he wears a button down casual shirt with my old khakis from when i went to private high school inb4 poor were actually pretty well off my dad just seriously doesnt give a shit about clothing or dressing well    my mom used to be effay but not anymore she buys clothing from the woman section of nordstrom or stein mart usually black sweatpants with a black sequined shirt a colored jacket to diffuse the black scheme she usually has a black leather handbag back to her being effay in her younger years some of the things she has in her closet are fiorucci jeans a leather furla bag and several very posh fur coats that she occasionally lends to my sister
  ok man go on looking like larry david
  tattoo on your mom      yikes i bet she was a thot in her day
  hah my dad was an arkansas hillbilly with the taste in clothing that resembled a pimp from tijuana and he insisted on making all the clothing decisions for my brother and me   thank god mom and grandma intervened from time to time i tried the hippie look in high school then adapted a modified prep/town and country look in my military and college days  if anything my dad showed me how not to dress the wimminz in the family had the best sense of style
  implying ld isnt a fashion icon
  my mom would always try to dress me in those sleazy button down shirts from alan flusser or robert graham my mom is into the sleazecore look the only thing possibly sleazecore about my dress style is my retro polos and tracksuits
  my dad was pretty effay as a teenager in the 80s but now hes 100 dadcore
  and  treading on racism buddy
  treading on racism buddy  treading on reddit lad
  the incessant need by an autist to get someone guarantees someone will take the bait
  im canadian not reddit friend
  thats probably why its desirable
  who the fuck post his mom come the fuck on
one time when i was wearing jeans flannel and boots my dad asked where i was going dressed up
  nope my mums a hippie health teacher and my dad was a scientist who dressed like an actual hobo and killed himself were well off but my family doesnt care about presentation which is what got me into fashion
  used to think my dad dressed like an axe murderer milsurp boots checked shirts wax jackets and a wide brimmed hat with a feather in it     now i realise he was pretty based
  its probably some random woman making it even weirder
  yes    but my dad and mom were stacy and chad so theyd rather tell me i look retarded with my hair or outfit rather than actually help me out that was when i was in middle school and they still bought my clothes
im 1/16 american indian would it be appropiate for me to wear a feather or do you need to be fullblood for that
youre either b8 or a literal fucking idiot
  cultural appropriation is a myth wear what you want and if anyone gives you crap tell them to fuck off
  why the fuck would you wear one is the question
  to show pride in my heritage
  
  if youre not at least half native its fucking gay
  w2c i want a big black indian headdress to wear to piss off everyone in my gay liberal town then yell at them that they cant use iphones because white people invented it
  ill take the bait and assume you genuinely want to know it would help to see what your face looks like though
what if youre 5/16th and look like male hila
  you get one feather boywhorunswithfags
  thats a stretch       muh we treated the indians so well lets just further wreck and repudiate their traditions and culture badass brother
all that matters is if you look native you could be 1 half native and look white and it would be cringey as fuck or 1/32nd and look like running buffalo and no one would question it    in any case if you want to show that you take pride in your heritage i would recommend wearing clothing with native american patterns rather than a fucking feather like youre in pocahantus
    if youre not enrolled youre not indian you cant legally possess eagle feathers as a member of the wannabe nation you can be fined up to 25k dont get me wrong nobody is going to arrest you most people arent even aware of the law but just fyi you should focus on showing pride in the other 15/16ths
  you cant legally possess eagle feathers  what the fuck thats gay   you should focus on showing pride in the other 15/16ths  showing pride at all in your race is fucking racist i hate anyone that has pride in their race whether that be black lives matter fags or dumbass kkk tards maybe people should accomplish things in order to gain pride not by association by some random blood relation also being prideful about anything is stupid accomplishment is its own reward pride obscures it
  its about culture not blood dipshit
  its got nothing to do with fractions and percentages you absolute archfaggot    are you a chief are you leading the cherokee nation to war right now then a headdress is appropriate    are you not doing that dont wear a headdress    are you going to coachella in some chintzy knockoff feathers chase a bullet through your cranium
  sounds like something one of those turks living in germany or mexicans living in mutt land would do
fuck no and in what situation would you need that for like what the fuck
guys im 1/64th black can i say the n word
im an enrolled member of the comanche tribe unless you are visibly ndn and or are above 25 and enrolled in a federal tribe fuck off and take pride in another aspect of your heritage stop being a mutt who cant find the time to grasp onto the majority of your heritage muh ndn blood will only get you laughed at and mocked by us your indian heritage is nonexistent
  no youre not and if you were you wouldnt be asking such a dumb fuck question    badass brother  i dont know why but this made me actually laugh
if i saw you on the rez i would just laugh dont be a dipshit and just drop this idea of yours hell come to the rez and have some fun if you want to hang with some natives just please dont wear that
guys im 1/128 russian is it appropriate for me to wear a tracksuit
1/16  so these retarded americans blood percentages are not just a meme     my heritage  an old white dude raped a native and thus created your lineage i dont see too much heritage to be proud of
  you are more indian than elizabeth warren so yes
  a syrian did akshually
  based and plainspilled  good luck in your future buttblasting both native and white steppoids
  t elizabeth warren
thoughts
  my fathers duffel coat goes below his knees as does mine make sure it does this for you as well i prefer darker colors but to each his own get the sleeves brought in to length and never remove the hood or get one without it at that price ensure its quality material from a good brand so it lasts longer good classic choice
duffle cpats are amazing
i was considering buying a duffle coat too but im 58 and skinny so i dont know about the whole falling below the knees but im confident enough i can pull it off or just get a shorter one at waist length
  do not get a waist length its a waste get a toggle button coat or something else but a duffel wont look right unless its the right thing also who cares if your skinny if it fits your shoulders and your sleeves its fine its supposed to be a long body covering coat thats literally the whole point
killing retarded christian missionaries    absolutely
  yikes now thats edgy
  fucking 6 foot bows what a pretentious accessory
  heathens arent effay
  im still undecided on monochrome black
dress how they want  dont care what anyone thinks  do whatever the hell they want whenever  absolutely
  no they lack control
lmao the censor bars for the dicks are so long
  actually you could be more wrong    tribes have strict rules and hierarchies regulating dress     in the west youre allowed to dress better than your professor in uni in a tribe you would be severely punished for wearing the robes of the clan leader
  but this specific tribe is not even in the bronze age so i doubt they have complex tribal traditions as such as those
  dick censoring  americans i swear
  t fucking bow authority
  youd be surprised  pretty much all huntergatherer tribes are premetal doesnt stop them from having rules regardinh who can wear what
  pretty sure those guys are manlets
  go away idolater       this one is for shooting down police helicopters
  is that the andaman islanders
  not using recurve bows    utter plebetry
how do i fix this
  dont go around bees
  grow a beard
  dont be younger than 25 babyface disappears with age more gaunt usually unless you gain weight  chew gum to exercise your jaw muscles and to combat general lazy facial muscles  smile more   exercise    you wont get rid of it but you can do small things with your facial features that will make it less pronounced
  sure    no    thanks will try everything you said
be happy
  use acceptance
cope
  is this what happens when you drink whilst pregnant

tfw to intelligent to wear down/puffers  maybe you should be more prepared for this call
not wearing softshells
  to intelligent  ok
  to  intelligent    yeah bro
  its not matter of intelligence its the matter of cold with pic related jacket you would freeze to death in a proper winter for one its not waterproof for two its not windproof if you want the same level of warmth from that jacket what you get from a cold weather down jacket you need to wear a mad amount of layers and youll look just as puffy as youd be wearing a down puffa the only difference that youll be retricted in your movement and feel heavy as fuck but yea stay intelligent and avoid down at all costs
  yeah maybe you should wear a crash helmet instead when you ride the short bus to school so you can learn the difference between too and to

  it took me at least 4 full listens of die lit to swallow the carti pill but it was worth it also pcl cover is as big of a meme as unknown pleasures at this point
      if youve taken the carti pill his next project is gearing up to be his best by far and even a potential contender for hip hop album of the year do yourselves a favor and listen to the molly snippet

i see a lot of people here talking about hair loss i did a lot of research when i thought i was going bald and would like to share an overview of all the solutions      buzzpill/power donut/natural  what is does this is where you either shave your head or keep your natural hair pattern but cut it in a way to look nice   pros   looks manly/high test   solution   having to worry if your method might not work and having self esteem beyond your hair   cons  t fit a lot of head shapes especially big foreheads like pic related   men usually arent as physically attractive   you look older    rogaine/minxoidil   what it does the chemicals in it allow for more nutrients to go to hair folicles meaning they are well nourished and more hair grows you apply it directly to your scalp in liquid form    pros    cheap   over the counter   stop/reverse balding on top always expect it will stop but it often will regrow    cons   works so long as you use it   efficacy doesnt work well for a lot of people  t meant for receding hairline the vertex which is what a lot of men are worried about    finasteride/duasteride/propecia etc    what it does these pills block the conversion of testosterone to dht which is the hormone that blocks nutrient flow to your hair follicles and makes you go bald    pros   effective medical treatment   on top and on receding hairline   some hair for most men dont go in expecting it though    cons   expensive the generic comes in 5 mg doses and you are only supposed to take 1 mg and you arent supposed to cut pills into anything less than halves for dosing efficacy   with lower sperm count lower libido and impotency not as many men suffer from this as youre led to believe    nearing character limit so ill continue in the thread
im currently using finasteride  minxoidil and my doctor gave me 5mg tablets of fin which he told me cut into quarters 1mg tablets arent subsidized here while 5mg ones are is there some issue with this
hair systems/toupees  what it does a stylist glues fake hair to your head    pros   decent if done well   be done on any level of balding   messing with chemicals    cons   has to be replaced somewhat often   fall off and youll look bad   change in appearance might have people make fun of you for getting hair work done    hair transplant  what it does follicles from the side of your head are taken and moved to the top these folllicles dont stop making hair so youre good     pros    time cost   most effective option for reversing hair loss see elon musk    cons     as much as a new car cheaper options might not look very good since you pay per follicle   everyone is a good candidate you want very thick side hair    only be done when balding has mostly stopped or youll lose hair behind your hairline and itll look patchy and weird
  just what i read im not a better source than your doctor so youre probably fine
  this dude would have looked completely fine with just shaving head
t meant for receding hairline the vertex which is what a lot of men are worried about  sorry but that is just completely wrong finasteride and minox both help in stopping a receding hairline from getting worse also finasteride is works in like 90 of males    so  limited efficacy doesnt work well for a lot of people  doesnt make any sense either
where can i get a shirt like this guys  i need those hong kong prisoner vibes on me
  there must be a black guy in every prison on earth what the hell is a black guy doing in china anyway
  structural racism
  sure but most girls hate it
  it depends on what youre smoking desu
  nope     enjoy your cancer
i still think that smoking occasionally is /fa/ but smoking constantly looks a lot sadder and grosser than it used to because now we know the health risks also because it fucks up your skin and teeth
  maybe  doesnt mean its worth it though
smoking hasnt been cool for literally over 50 years outside of movies dont start
  bad breath is not effay and neither is smelling like a used ashtray to a person standing 3 metres away   it sucks to stand in line next to a smoker they smell bad
            smoking is bad because someone somewhere said it was     for a broad of individualist id assume you could form your own opinions guess not
  someone somewhere said it was  ive been smoking for years fucking faggot its horrible and disgusting also there isnt a single thing about this board that ecourages individualism the hivemind is almost as bad as rddit
  bait or mentally retarded
  do it
  prove smoking is bad and not smoking twp packs a day anything in excess is bad for you smoking a pack a week has no negative health effects and is demonstrably true
2018  doesnt smoke    are you bullied mentally handicapped or both    bbut it kills you    and was life a contest about who lives the longest    its addicting    its not as long as youre not underaged and you can smoke in moderation    itsits expensive    who forces you to buy a pack every day fucking peatgavel
  sure list a few sources that you deem acceptable so when i prove you completely wrong you dont dismiss them as jew media
  that hairline    hes not gonna make it
  its still cool  being addicted to it is gay
always /fa/  always a social lubricant   always easy to find sexual partners   always a perfect start to the sunrise with coffee   always a perfect end to the day  always so satisfying post coitus    or you could be a vaper like pic related
  guess im a sheep for thinking cutting my dick off is bad and a majority of people agreeing with me  enjoy your lung cancer
  why are you so obssessed with jews

  guess im a sheep for thinking cutting my dick off is bad
  circumcision isnt just a jewish practice it didnt even originate with jews and amerifags canadafags australiafags and muslims all do it so some extent calling the practice barbaric is an insult to real barbarians
  how is circumcision related to smoking
  both of them make autistic people mad
  not the guy youre replying to but harvard has shown that it is indeed barbaric and jewish at least in america

black hair/fashion thread    discuss black hair hair products and fashion   black hair community  
omg whos spamming this why not just add to the hair general
  hairgen doesnt really have much for people with kinky haur
why would black people bother posting on 4chan i dont mind but it seems like a place where the word nigger is used at least 3 times in any decently sized thread isnt a natural option when looking for a discussion board    in order to make this post somewhat relevant to the thread pic related is one of my favorite black hair styles it looks so god damn good
  black americans use nigger quite often themselves so why would that be an issue
    black  posts mixed people with a high percentage of white dna and have mostly caucasoid facial structures  hm
  it wasnt really the niggerthing per se mostly the blatantly racist attitude the average 4chan poster has
  ive become desensitised to it at this point its just amusing especially when i see people saying if you arent blonde and blueeyed then youre basically a nigger
  people saying if you arent blonde and blueeyed then youre basically a nigger  guessing you use more boards than just /fa/ then lol     also are all the greentexts about  be white  put on timbs  he cute  any true in the sense that timbs are a universal status symbol to blacks i cringe into my own asshole whenever i see one of those unironically posted
  what products do you guys use for dry hair i have pic related hair and things like shea butter makes it feel greasy
  i guess it might be true for some people timbs are popular among black americans mostly but even then only in some places if youre asking me if this is how women think how the fuck would i know      i use water and soap nigga
  er and a is different like if one black person called another black person er shit would go down    most black people on 4chan are mixed
  learn lco or loc method anon
  i use a leave in conditioner
  ty ill look into this      any recommendations i also have the issue of my curls being stiff
white person here is there a white equivalent of this
  about the closest youll get
  because its important for black people to open their eyes to racism and see the fact that its more prevalent than one might think
thoughts on me getting this hairstyle for my graduation picture or should i wear an afro
  how long is your hair
  ive been growing it for about 3 years so it about 912 inches if i stretch it out
have had an afro for the last 5 years  easily recognizable and a conversation starter  forced me to become a sociable person and to develop my social skills  now im considered one of the friendliest people on campus currently in grad school    grow out your hair and get an afro today although i have no idea what to do with my facial hair gf wants me to keep it but i just want to style it differently its currently a thick chin strap with a soul patch and a rather thick mustache suggestions
  why would black people bother posting on 4chan  a lot of the use of the word nigger on 4chan isnt out of racism or hate most of the time  its just a release people want and take advantage of due to anonymity  same goes for the word faggot i doubt there are many people on 4chan who hate gays to the level of westboro baptist church but because were anon we can do it and whatever else we want here    honestly the nword isnt as common as you think it may be on a board like /b/ or /pol/ yeah but this site isnt focused on poster identity and race rarely come up unless through shitposting or serious discussion  if youre casually on boards like /a/ /m/ /vr/ etc you might never even find out about that side of 4chan    ive always seen 4chan as the shadow to the mainstream persona of western social media internet culture  using both in unison give you a new perspective on the kinds of people on the net and even the real world
  you mean the only redeemable features
how do i do this
why arent you holding her /fa/
cause there exists a better girl
  because i hate myself too much to improve myself to the point im attractive and confident enough to approach someone and too mentally ill to be able to have a healthy equal relationship with meaningful emotional intimacy even if i did achieve it i would hold her to an unreasonable expectation and end up resenting her when she justifiably doesnt meet my unrealistic expectations and pushing her away or vilifying myself enough that she leaves me i am not hardwired for meaningful human contact my birth and survival was a mistake and i am a blemish on the species an error in the code that wasnt eliminated or corrected i will live an empty existence and either kill myself when the time comes if some chaotic merciful force doesnt do it for me or wither away and rot in the corner and become a husk that drains resources untill they die of natural causes
its not me im a loner
   i fucked a girl that dressed up as rei for halloween so does that mean i did this already

is there any way to stop getting fucked when selling my 2500 watch on ebay whats stopping people claiming that i sent an empty box    pic unrelated
  is that bezel ceramic does it come in steel ceramic bezels on sports watches are dumb
  looks like someone got a new hannukah present
  after you sell like 10 or 20 things you get more seller protection
  yes      black friday shouldnt of bought anything but my hands were tied i cant pass on true valueeeeee both watches were on my list and got  slashed because they are both from back alley chinese people pic related is coming next
  is it better than the squale 1545 what movement it has
  nah i doubt it its more competing with tisell and other homages around 300 just a miyota 9015 i was ready to eventually pay 300 for it so was happy to grab it at 240 i like their wavemaster too     
ive not heard good things about phoibos chinese and the customer service is what youd expect from the chinese
  i didnt realize theyre chinese wnc that and the octopus sort of look like a mask with those eyeholes too spooky
  ive seen mixed really dug into whether their qc was alright before buying and their fuck up rate is pretty low probably more than normal microbrands or whatever but thats the game if you want china man value
are there any small watches that have a thermometer ive been wanting a thermometer for camping and my current watch is too bulky when im wearing both jacket and gloves    ideally something cheap but im willing to spend up to a few hundred

  the pants
    yeah see the problem here isthese are gonna get dirty and look like shit real quick    theyre the kind of shoes that girls wear to raves and just get absolutely destroyed
  thats actually exactly what i want i want to get them dirty and give them an old look
  this has to be bait hell no    teknos arent terrible but id reccomend you go for the off white/orange colorway over these these are too bright white and most likely wont age to an off white color due to all the synthetic materials theyll just get dirty and look awful    joggers
  fug i dont really like the orange streak thats why i wanna get these  ill give it some thought tho thanks anon
    they arent joggers nigger they are wind pants
faux suede looks warmer than anything i own yes
    for the price you could get actual leather or suede if you did a bit more shopping keep looking sheepskin also looks better yo

  this
  maybe in black i prefer the other colour though
  easy cop    dont fall for the designer wallet meme just get this     yes that doesnt look feminine at all
  thanks anon bag dude here    my gfs trying to convince me that the black is better but i like the brown more    my concern is that the black wont work with most of my fits and im especially concerned itll look tryhard if im wearing black jeans kinda like someone playing matchy matchy because they think they can dress like someone in gq    would you mind being the tiebreaker in this debate    inb4 why do you care what your gf thinks/why do you care what an anon thinks
  get brown
  thanks 
  personally i like the look of the black more but thats because i took the allblackpill but if the brown will work better then definitely get that they both look really nice
  forgot to mention the brown looks more masculine anyway
    really appreciate the advice id like to take the allblackpill one day but im too poor for that ill look like i took the hobopill
  love u baby
repost for opinions      too expensive for faux        christ    shearling imo
for 90     not gonna lie im kinda into the one on the right but it might make you look as if youre larping as a traffic cop
  way too pricey i swear these fucking people that post this shit think they know vintage and charge rape for it this jacket is worth no more than 30
    discounted from 200  end me
  get shearling lasts you way longer is easier to style and is comfier
  you going to do bdsm with a bomber jacket on
y/n
  the absolute state of /fa/
    whats this called looks dope as fuck
  you are wrong
  please dont    theyre okay    dont like em tbqh    no its neither truly cool looking nor good materials    probably yes unless you have a very bad body    no pls acne suxx    out of these the shearling wins easily    dont wear graphic tees especially ones that are these lame    grandpa shoes no pls    looks decent better than the black one    i dont like nonleather bombers  its okay for one    get one where the shearling is white and visible    brown looks far more interesting imo
  im really undecided about this i want a common projects clone but every single one has flaws the arigatos flaw being that it looks too bulky
yes/no tell me fags
  yes
i dont like the hype behind yeezy but i cant stop likeing 500 silhouette
    check adidas court vantage in all white they look nice and are much cheaper than any common projects clone        the hype crowd considers yeezys dead because its so easy to get a pair nowadays  good news for everyone else i think now its actually possible to wear a pair without them dominating the entire outfit since theyre not a hype superpiece anymore and stand more on the actual aesthetics and not just the limited availability
  i like them too to be honest if you can find them for a decent price id say go for it
  
  the all black 500s are fucking incredible
  im shopping for vegan shoes i havent found boots so please give opinions about pic related        i like black between the two but i would also recommend any other bag from       another vote for allblack      would cop if lining was faux shearling for retro fits                  dnc
    editing to add  the 2 wedges are size 95 and i am between 885 would it be possible to wear them or get them to fit
  probably not sizing down in shoes is sometimes ok but sizing up especially for shoes youre not going to wear with socks is almost always a bad idea you could roll your ankle easily if theyre too big
  are you really bragging that any grandma on the street could probably take you down
  keked
    appreciated i wont buy buying ㅅฅ can i please get your rating though on 1 2 and 3
hhelp

  is this an hm piece
  chinatown market
  i know looks like one though pretty boring but if you wore a jacket over it might look decent
  yeah i was thinking itd look good with a colored zip up hoodie and a jean jacket or something   the only issue is i dont have either of those things kek any recommendations from where to cop a basic hoodie and maybe some sweatpants too im in desperate need of some essentials i feel like i dont have that many clothes
  honestly i was at both gap and old navy the other day since my brother wanted a plain hoodie and they had some nice gear for cheap i would avoid hm for basics though
  why should i avoid them i was thinking of just going gildan for the zip up i got a pullover and even though its a teensy bit baggy it gets the job done
  in my experience their quality is below sub par and generally a waste of money other people here have crucified me for saying that while others agree so its kind of a luck of the draw thing a piece might last you years but i dont think its even worth the risk gildan is alright im not a huge fan personally but if you like the pullover you should get a zip up
i really want to buy a torc the one i want is literally from a larp shop but i dont look too autistic and im convinced i could pull it off the question is should i
  a torc like the thing you wear around your neck

honest opinions on this brand
  good outerwear but overpriced
  im not gonna pay 240 for 80 wool 20 polyamide made in china knitwear just to look like a zoomer chav
good jackets like some of their track pants that arent skinny crap rest is moneyfishing shit but few good stuff here and there sometimes also osti was g o a t
its a brand for middle class white zoomers that listen to immigrant rap music over here
  like it have two jumpers pretty uncommon in my country gets a bad rap in england looks like its nigger tier over there    expensive af though
  for real some of the knitwear is exactly what youd get from uniqlo with 200 dollar tag if i buy that i expect a chunkier knit or higher quality material
football hooligans always come to mind but i not really sure why its just what ive been told
  how did football hooligans afford 500 pound jackets in the first place
  thats one of the reasons why im confused as im pretty sure they all shop exclusively at sports direct i mean theyre not the brightest so maybe they just spend all their benifits on jackets
    what is shoplifting  what is mugging
  contrary to popular believe shops that sell stone island often dont have them somewhere up for the taking outside or something they have a lot of well trained staff and dont have too many people inside at once
      football hooliganism is dead for the most part these matchday hooligans as they call them are just local middle class kids that spend way too much money on clothing and appearance and act tough 1 day per week together with their friends    im a substitute teacher at a very posh school and theres heaps of boys wearing stone island jackets often driving vespas as well and larping as arab drug dealers its pretty hilarious when you think about it  and back in my highschool days about 10 years ago it were the same type of guys that had stone island just kids with rich parents larping as scum
  chavs
biggest brand for chavs in uk some alright stuff but i just associate the brands with chavs now
  its football hooligan tier in england you moron thats mostly white poor folks
      actual chavs wear sports brands and junk like fred perry   the ones wearing stone island are just middle class kids that listen to soundcloud hiphop and probably browse /fa/ as we speak
  poor  so nigger tier then
  t stoney wearing retard  middle class kids pretending to be hard chavs wear all the junk ralph fred perry stoney fila nike adidas tommy cp company paul and shark doesnt make them bad brands er se  the kids wearing stoney with nike trackies are the same ones who got brought to school in a porsche or audi 2 years ago it is laughable and extremely cringe    but seriously you need to kill yourself for writing that description
  im not talking chavs specifically stone island is legitimately a football ultra not that england has real ultras brand in england if you see a guy wearing a stone island jacket at a game you know hes looking for a punch up google it its not some hidden secret or something its like red laces on docs
  if you see someone wearing a stone island jacket at a game theres a 70 chance hes there with his dad    t listens to soundcloud hiphop
  shut up middle class nerd   i feel offended for even being regarded as a hip hop listener
  mate you know im not talking about high school kids stop pretending you dont know what im talking about or stop pretending youre from england
i dont believe anyone who wears stone island can be an actual hooligan
  i think youre just repeating age old memes from long before your time and believe they hold any sort of truth today
  anyone who wears stone island is a globalist nato shill
  in case youre wondering why that is stone island is a complete scam of a company that just took its logo from something already excisting it was made by the same guy that started cp company
  isnt that just a very standard design for old maps
  also that same guy could be most important designers to ever exist
  yeah windrose
baracuta is better
  overhyped overpriced you pay extra for a fucking arm patch
  perhaps but stone island is nothing but a moneygrab look at toyota and lexus toyota is one of the greatest car companies out there meanwhile lexus is just a marketing trick to grab money from westerners
  yep he took stonie with him in grave meme island is maserati of clothing
  i heard you can get beaten for wearing that in eastern europe
its for uppermiddle class teenagers in northern europe and scandinavia
  you get beaten regardless of what youre wearing in eastern europe
  if youre a shitskin its very possible refugees are not welcome here
  the least amount of arm patch what a unit of currency can buy
effay if ur a drugdealer fail if ur middle class
their retarded branding ruins even their most interesting pieces some of their items are extremely ovepriced  i always imagined that this is what you wear when you graduate from wearing emporio armani crap
what does this wardrobe consist of  the look that comes to mind for me is a black turtleneck cuffed black wool trousers and i dont know some black leather derbies or dirty white sneakers what watch should i wear outerwear
  just dress like the faggot you are  should shine through your personality
dont even worry about the fit dude just open your mouth im sure people will catch on quick enough
    maybe my autism kicked in too hard when making this thread it was somewhat satirical in nature still unironically trying to look philosophy breaux core
  post more lukas pls
was he effay

  yes and so were the guys in pickups driving home from work in weeeeeeeeeestttttttttt virginiaaaaaaaaaa
why is fashion so obsessed with youth culture
because it sells
  clothing  culture bitch
  i always thought it was weird how everything fashion related is supposed to be marketed towards kids when adults are the only people with disposable income i suppose its because adults are too busy with responsibilities to spend a ridiculous amount of money on clothes the target age group of most brands is 1823 at that age you start working but dont have everything in order so you start blowing money on things you dont need
  fashion is self expression by definition hype shit is not fashion
  the target age group of most brands is 1823  no its not thats the target age for most streetwear hype brands but that makes up only a small fraction of the total industry id argue that the actual target age for most clothing is an even spread across the market with people 65 or older being the least represented you just see brands like supreme and think all of these brands are obsessed with youth culture when theyre not but thats because you might be exposed to supreme and similar brands more than others
  thats mostly because these are the only brands that need ads to be noticed
  thats a good point
  even still what about high end brands like balenciaga gucci undercover no 9 lv raf simmons helmut lang which have all made efforts to appeal to younger audiences be it through celebrity collaborations or ventures into streetwear
  yeah theyre making a push towards that audience because its hot right now but i highly doubt that will be the case in a few years and i also doubt thats a sustainable direction they are definitely prevalent here and within fashion circles but they are nowhere near having a prevalent market share across the globe designer brands and fashion houses dont even come close to making up 10 of the entire clothing industry in the us alone which has the largest market for clothing in the world
  yeah but are the majority of the clothing industry really that relevant i mean if you think about it most people get their clothes from the mall are places like old navy kohls hm really considered to be pushing the envelop i understand theyre the majority of the market but the most influential powers in the fashion industry are those top brands/houses   also just curious where do you see fashion going in the coming years personally i think the youth/streetwear movement has a little more gas left in the tank but it is dying out since everyone has done it to death
  yeah but are the majority of the clothing industry really that relevant  it depends on what you mean by relevant are they relevant because they clothe the majority of the population well yeah but theyre not exactly reinventing the wheel they play it safe almost all the time and they lightly follow trends without going too niche but in terms of originality and design skill theyre not relevant in the slightest    but to counter that point i wouldnt exactly say big houses or the hype brands are really pushing the envelope either extra emphasis on the hype brands its the same flashy gear every season with stolen or repurposed designs at least with some of the real designer brands they at least sort of experiment even if its just lines that are directly influenced by fashion from a few decades ago    also just curious where do you see fashion going in the coming years  personally i think the youth/streetwear movement has a little more gas left in the tank but it is dying out since everyone has done it to death    i definitely agree with your statement on youth and streetwear culture but i dont think streetwear in general is going i think well see a very harsh decline in people wearing heavily branded gear for example i think supreme is either going to have its biggest year yet soon or maybe thats already happened and were already in the declining phase same goes for the rest its becoming very stale and the people that eat it up are even starting to realize that designer brands will always be around because some of them legitimately deliver a quality product and there will always be people that are eccentric    as far as style goes who really knows i think well see a revival of eighties fashion as weve seen with nineties fashion in the last five years or so more regurgitation definitely some new big players within the next decade the us has been slowly moving towards a much more european style over the years too
kids want to be adults and adults just want to be kids again
  big houses or the hype brands are really pushing the envelope either extra emphasis on the hype brands  very true however i dont think the high end brands are underperforming that much they make good clothes even if theyre not shattering the conception of what the medium can be this sounds like a huge copout but how different can they make things hype brands have kind have been stuck in their own box for a while now unfortunately which is ironic because the whole idea behind streetwear was that it was antieverything    i agree with you that something big will happen in the coming years though supreme has been shit for while now akira and scarface collections were especially shit and i think people are realizing its not as cool as it used to be and that goes for other streetwear/youth brands across the board theyre just not cool anymore not only does everyone have hype clothes their new designs have been fucking boring and trend hoppy lately in all honesty i actually really liked streetwear when it was authentic and interesting now its just spoiled rich kid fashion people in japan and korea implement streetwear style in a kind of interesting way but they still reek of i paid a lot for this so it must look good mindset     i wouldnt get hung up on people mimicking eighties style too much though personally i feel like we went through the eighties revival already and idk if itll happen again
  its not obsessed and its just some of the brands these brands found the loophole and preying on the weak someone mentioned that adults are the only people with disposable income that might be true but adults have kids and they do spend on their kids they buy a lot bigger things than just a few clothes  you make most of your irresponsible decisions when youre young thats when youre the most gullible and thats when the sheeple mentality peer pressure is the strongest anything can sell without actual value brands know this very well
  as other posters have said kids and people wo are trying to be young spend more money on clothes    also brands that are more attuned to advertisinginfluenced consumers ie the young and those trying to be young tend to advertise more so you see them more
  tfw too old to wear hypbeast styles  it sucks fellow bloomers/zoombers
  be thankful that you cant participate in those moneygrabs anymore
i suppose it always has been ever since like ww2 when kids realised they had money
  western culture is obsessed with the youth in general anyone above 30 might as well not exist
because the youth are stupid trend hopping sheep that have their parents buy everything for them
get the cream
because its really easy to trick kids into buying your shitty shit garbage clothes for exorbitant prices for superfluous reasons

  truly fashionable no     en vouge during this particular slice of time yes     off white will go the way of the hundreds diamond hood by air and every other brand that blows up in the urban scene     postironic streetwear is about as lame as it gets but somehow he was able to get the backing to convert the dead pyrex brand into something else thats actually sought after can he do it again only time will tell     off white will be looked back on as one of those what the fuck were we thinking moments in time much like see through air force 1s and coogi denim are viewed today there will be no revival once its dead no fond memories only the notion of what the fuck was i on
  virgil is lvmhs now thats not going to happen and the true genius of virgil was never the clothes he is the king of networking like real networking not the buzz networking people talk about in business classes he literally has links to everyone in the fashion scene also athletes and musicians  trendsetters even haider wears his converse collab he sits front row at a hedi show hell he even got a picture with hedi theres just no way he would be cancelled unless theres a major shift in pop culture ie heavier music becomes the mainstream it thing and fashion would change with that
  theres just no way he would be cancelled unless theres a major shift in pop culture ie heavier music becomes the mainstream it thing and fashion would change with that  grunge revival is coming boy
  grunge is literally for faggots
  and the true genius of virgil was never the clothes he is the king of networking    i agree see       somehow he was able to get the backing to convert the dead pyrex brand into something else thats actually sought after      his fits/designs themselves are trash but thats not what garners a brand publicity or prestige     hes not going to get cancelled but whats the move when people move onto the next thing will he restructure or keep the current brand name hes already done it once and changing brand names every 6 years is not a sustainable model off white is so well known and closely associated with urban fashion trends he would have to restructure under a new moniker but thats a terrible move in terms of building a brand long term his connections got him whee he is but cant keep him relevant when the point comes that nobody checking for his stuff
  good points but personally i believe virgil is at a point where he isnt a trend anymore he has elevated himself definitely from the pyrex era but id say in the last 12 years he has gone past the offwhite virgil as well he is louis virgil now sounds a bit dumb but im trying to say that he has grown out of simply being something thats in currently the way i see it is that his friends literally decide whats considered fashionable in the mainstreamish culture so how could he fall out if his friends are literally the people who decide whats in and whats not    the thing i like about him is the way he has constructed his own personal brand smart enough not to participate in anything too risky ie kanyes political statements yet smart enough to keep kanye very close even when it might be considered a bit risky  the hug at the end of louis show     and he is not weak he is not dependant on his friends  even though they are probably his greatest asset its not like with hba where all it took to kill the brand was one line from rocky actually one of my favourite things is this video  at 210 listen to what rocky says and now few years later whos that rocking the 1s at the beginning  funny    same situation with the louis appointment he didnt need it lvmh needed him him the person kering had both michele  demna who did lvmh have its a business after all and in this current time ig logomania whatnot virgil is the person you want to have at the helm of louis    hopefully this didnt come off as too pretentious of a post but i genuinely find him interesting as a phenomenon if i studied marketing id definitely do some research on how he ended up in that situation
