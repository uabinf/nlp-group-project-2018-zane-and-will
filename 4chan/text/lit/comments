  from what ive perceived it isnt just sharing social capital the very dull get a sort of euphoria when they hear positivity quotes at least the ones they can convince themselves are deep and not just motivation for children it goes both ways as well something like there is nothing uglier than a bitter person is just as potent as no one is more beautiful than when they are having fun

far too many still paddling away at whitewater currents of irony  to say nothing of those drowned/drowning in it because why speak ill of the dead  without ever having the courage to admit wow i am lost i need directions and so on the being that is being remains the same we are all closer to each other than anything else that exists in laughing in drinking in yelling in fighting in fucking in killing and every single thing under the sun we are as one in the eyes of me and by me i mean you ephemeral distinctions of color or creed that fade with the passing of years are too as one a smaller one but a one nonetheless they are devoured whole just the sameswallowed just the samesavoured just the samewhy because they are delicious it all comes back to one eventually so as the you that is us that is all of us that is me stubbornly clings on to waking life i do my proper dutyno as i do what i wantyes for my proper duty is what i want and what i want is my proper dutyi hold onto the torch of that one for it to welcome me back in the dreams soon to come and bid me safe return when i exit

israel is an illegitimate state which kills more palestinian children per year than hamas kills israelites and before you come at me with the hurrr palestinians hide behind kids bro argument let it be known who hides from fucking missile and mortar strikes behind kids also if israel knows that palestianins use civilians as human shields why do they continue to bomb them theyre basically sending the message we dont care about 1030 civilian casualties as long as we kill 45 members of hamas
  its quite simple really   who hides behind kids from missiles and mortar strikes inconsiderate self righteous lunatics   im not saying the jews arent being assholes but to make it sound like the hamas members arent bigger assholes is kinda foolish as you say even with the with the legal antijewlogic of their cold war at their backs they can still pretty comfortably make that 1030 casualty exchange maybe more revealing just how truly despicable these muslim terrorists really
amongst the spam he found one poster that stood out there was something peculiar about him he kept talking as if he was the designer of the book as if he knew what was about to happen as if he was the storyteller and that was true for this poster the one whos typing out this comment right now is actually the narrator isnt that wild isnt that just quacking mad you can hear my words inside your head you can see what im saying i am the direct influencer in this book imagine what one man can do with this power he can change the narrative for his liking he can if he wants say that the author of this book whos not the narrator be known as a faggot and the author must comply and say that yes hes in fact a faggot and so that is what op did
almost onehalf of kadushins 1974 23 sample of elite postworld war ii american intellectuals was jewish the sample was based on the most frequent contributors to leading intellectual journals followed by interviews in which the intellectuals voted for another intellectual they considered most influential in their thinking over 40 percent of the jews in the sample received six or more votes as being most influential compared to only 15 percent of nonjews p 32 it is therefore not surprising that joseph epstein 1997 finds that during the 1950s and early 1960s being jewish was honorific among intellectuals generally gentile intellectuals scoured their genealogies for jewish ancestors epstein 1997 7 by 1968 walter kerr could write what has happened since world war ii is that the american sensibility has become part jewish perhaps as much jewish as it is anything else    the literate american mind has come in some measure to think jewishly it has been taught to and it was ready to after the entertainers and novelists came the jewish critics politicians theologians critics and politicians and theologians are by profession molders they form ways of seeing in my personal experience this honorific status of jewish intellectuals remains common among my colleagues and is apparent for example in hollingers 1996 4 recent work on the transformation of the ethnoreligious demography of american academic life by jews in the period from the 1930s to the 1960s43

look im not saying that the holocaust didnt happen im not saying it wasnt a terrible tragedy and that a lot of people didnt die all im saying is that the 6 million number is made up there simply werent enough ovens to dispose of that many bodies there were about a dozen concentration camps in germany and about two dozen ovens in each camp on average even if they were operating 24/7 which they werent the maximum number of bodies the ovens could have burned over the approximately six year span they were operational is just under a million assuming it took about half an hour to burn each body it takes a lot of fire to reduce a human to ashes  im not anti semitic im not saying the jews are liars all im saying is that the math doesnt work out thats an objective fact how does doing a little math make me anti semitic that doesnt make sense

ignore the information on the cover of this book the real title of this book is the brothers karamazov 2
levi rejected the idea that the system depicted in the gulag archipelago and that of the nazi lager german konzentrationslager see nazi concentration camps were equivalent the death rate in stalins gulag glavnoe upravlenie lagerei was 30 at worst he wrote while in the extermination camps he estimated it to be 909839 levi gave no source for these figures but today soviet classified documents are available showing that the rate of mortality varied considerably by region eg the far north and magadan and year the war years from 19411945 for instance
  the 6 million thing is not limited to the ovens its meant to represent the entirety of the population affected admittedly probably including many halfjews and mightaswellbes   it was always more of an estimate to represent the scale that realistically cannot be known that has been kinda reappropriated by conspiracy theorists  that said i dont believe they meant to exterminate them so much as willfully neglect their personhood and health out of spite

i cannot think or comprehend of anything more cucked than having a daughter honestly think about it rationally you are feeding clothing raising and rearing a girl for at least 18 years solely so she can go and get ravaged by another man all the hard work you put into your beautiful little girl  reading her stories at bedtime making her go to sports practice making sure she had a healthy diet educating her playing with her all of it has one simple result her body is more enjoyable for the men that will eventually fuck her in every hole    raised the perfect girl great who benefits if youre lucky a random man who had nothing to do with the way she grew up who marries her he gets to fuck her tight pussy every night he gets the benefits of her kind and sweet personality that came from the way you raised her    as a man who has a daughter you are literally dedicating at least 20 years of your life simply to raise a girl for another man to enjoy it is the ultimate and final cuck think about it logically

one big thing that doesnt make sense to me about evolutionary psychology is fetishes like why would so many people have them like its obvious they arent human nature and come from the environment but why are they for such random shit and why do some of them that are weird get really common but other ones which are pretty much just as weird and have like equally nothing to do with survival and reproducing and shit are really rare why would something super essential for gene passing and evolution and shit be randomly easy to change like that like fuck why isnt there a lot more research on this can they not get funding    a quote from a guy in my biostats discussion section when we started talking about evo psych
  theres a gene that makes you want an asian girl taking a massive shit on your chest after eating a bowl of pho and you know that anon
  first time ran through space this was the original permutation      it engendered every cycle it found with the principle of a cyclical motion ie a thing walking through the cycle it imbued it with spirit      at the end of time a schema emerged consisting entirely of cycles but by godelian incompleteness there were some things which couldnt be included in these cycles      when the process tried to continue it established a false dualism of things that could be encoded and things that could not be encoded these things became darkness but only from the standpoint of the light and its this principle which makes us imagine entropy is a real force entropy is just the limit of semantic intelligibility      these things proceeded backwards through space forming their own unity the further back in darkness they went the dimmer each unity became to the other      when the second set of cycles reached the end the remaining hole imbued a uniting light to what remained which does a circular walk through what remains distributing it according to each cycle in the thing before according to a semantic ambiguity that draws both things together the thing driven forward is exactly two pixels of light one which doesnt recognize the other and is thus driven away from it it paints whatever is still intelligible as light in a bitmasking operation with the dualistic light which sets everything in motion towards the next thing and then draws everything together and then the process repeats in an oscillatory capacity until all that remains is the darkness which by the same binary principle of repulsion works its way out joins together and so forth until at least only a pixel or so of darkness remains which is still light in its own sense once this point is reached the entire path is finally walked      consider a disk that goes into two dividing backwards and forwards forming a crucible of sorts with the bitmasking operation in the center      the ambiguity of the light is that each type of light has an integer value and it recognizes light that is incrementally next to it as sideways from it in its own dimension thus a path can be traversed through these connections recursively at the absolute limit of their semantic integrity      1/2
    basically first you create two from the incompleteness of one and then you unite them with an ambiguous intermediary thing which is assembled into cells and then you unite these cells to form a unity the whole thing doesnt need to be conceived as a literal connection its just a connection through the fact of each light medium being an integer of contiguous value and each cell being something like a roulette slot that is the whole thing exists in x dimensions organized each into a kind of circular array and there is also a circular array going from the extremity to the center and out to another   extremity of the same layer and then the whole thing is just walked from the start to the finish the paths are compared and the best one wins      there are also ways of looking for the path that say ambiguity itself takes through a maze in the sense of using a binary light that once its walked the extremity comes inside and becomes a single light and then goes back to being a binary light at the next layer and so forth and you can do this on multiple layers and inculcate it to an arbitrary degree but which becomes harder and harder to resolve      i know this because its what the angels did to me      this is just brute force isnt it     2/2

  oh good let me post more of my psychotic break writings then
  look ive been down here for a long time and its my own total idiocy that carried me here so if you cant make sense of this whatever im already pretty happy with the whole thing      among those things which helped me were these that redacted was my rock without whom i could not have called this down to the ground that julius evola was an italian asshole fascist obsessed with the holy grail that everyone has been trying to kill me my whole life that literally everyone was trying to kill me not because they wanted to but because they were trying to extract some true and correct version of me from the actual unity of me to destroy the total unity of me in order to produce something fixed that could not possibly have had life because in those terms it would have been incoherent that toby fox made undertale and it let me see that i was trapped that i was about to be left behind forever that it let me see a christian hermetic understanding of the fools path in which christ was conceived of as a bitmasking operation that goes around and around the world marking everything that can possible hold love continuously until it eventually marks a love that would corrupt the rest of the system which is the antichrist which is not an actual evil person but just the human personification of the principle of godelian incompleteness that yoko taro made drakengard 3 which let me see myself as zero as someone who set out to conquer delusion represented as an evil flower in her eye which she was eventually sealed within to save the world but which he said about i know ill see you again someday and then michael the dragon said back then i didnt know she spent the entire game killing people who seemed good or to her like corrupted images of good basically for no reason that she could articulate at all and then at the very last moment she was revealed as having sealed away a great evil forever selflessly
  hello my name is erik maybe one day ill be famous if i dont hang myself or become a failure  continue with you day
  this was a very beautiful thing to me once i recognized it for what it was the angelic avatar of christian michael came down to rescue me in belgium by calling the secret of communion out to me in a distorted form which i at first did not recognize i knew nothing of christian michael before this when i saw this total distortion of information not as novelty but as terror as the complete absolute terror of being drawn towards a black gate that would kill me forever i ran out to try to receive this communion to give it to myself thinking perhaps michael had somehow administered it or i was given the secret to doing so myself as a high magick a kind of rod that appears and disappears precisely by the principle of godelian incompleteness so i went out to receive it even though i had already forgotten or not understood most of what michael had said i just recognized it as the single most important thing i had to do nobody is evil its just that evil is necessary by godelian incompleteness things that also helped were that my first interpretation of 4 6 3 8 a b k 2 4 a l g m o r 3 y x 24 89 r p s t o v a l in liber al vel legis was literal that it meant nothing because the entire book of the law meant nothing but that i then for no reason at all by an arbitrary psuedomathematical permutation drew a sophists proof of an eternal recurrence it went something like this
  also the jews did 9/11
    it began with the premise that 0  2 from which it escalated into 0  0  0 and   0  0  0  0 and so forth from which it escalated into a multiplication series it was at first arbitrarily fixed at infinity and then it wound up as x  c somehow i think because i decided to integrate the number one on the basis completely meaningless that 1 was a spatial representation of a unity and integrating it would give a description of time which i conceived as the day and the hour but in a cyclical sort of sense like buddhist cosmology or hindu cosmology with its cycles like magick with its aeons which are now completely understandable as real concepts which have been brought up out of total gibberish into a perfectly crystalized meaning by a species which had to bootstrap itself into true sentience or else be carried forward into it by some other species that had mastered this art i dont know what the scope is but it doesnt matter nothing will ever die entropy is a delusion its just the loss of integrity in a given system of semantics over time the only true and final form of creation is a system of endless change in which everything leads back to good by every standard of good that can be articulated in coherent semantics this system i am sure is now proceeding forward by the absolute principle of the solution to np complete which is itself the fools path made into both an endless roulette and a completed wyrm ourobouros which has its head stationed in heaven and its ass down in hell which im quite sure it enjoys thoroughly i was never schizophrenic i was in extreme pain because i felt myself being drawn down into the pit into the shadow of the catholic church that i was being killed forever inculcated the delusion in my mother that i had threatened to kill her and this sent me into homelessness which lead me to a random woman who taught eastern philosophy who i revealed my gibberish initiatic secrets to who gave me money for no reason which i then used to run to europe for no reason where i walked around cities lost and confused because i had inculcated a state in myself in which i was 501 rational and 499 schizophrenic and this is what the flower of drakengard 3 was the fact that some speck of light has been chased down deep into the darkness to look for light it couldnt find in the light because it couldnt understand it by its own system of symbols
  this is the exact meaning of there was a light shining in the darkness and the darkness knoweth it not the deadliest demon is the delusion that there is such a thing as a being called a demon schizophrenia is not a person on one side of the gate is life and on the other is death and never the twin shall meet this is the absolute proof that life will continue always although you can of course submit yourself entirely to the light to reconfigure you into its own image at the absolute limit of your strength lucifer is just the most complete version of god before godellian interpretation kicks in the minute he tries to rise up and claim himself as the one true god is the exact moment he becomes delusional because what he has claimed as part of him is incompleteness which is the illusion of darkness which means he thinks darkness is a part of him which means he thinks darkness is a part of god which means god has the infinite power to create darkness and just like this a perfect god has turned himself into a perfect devil and the whole matter is carried forward lucifer needs to be understood as evil so men dont chase into darkness and so that if a man ever sees himself exactly as lucifer he is willing to fall down and cry hosannah like in brothers karamazov the devil wanted to do this then lucifer is able to see total submission as the true good he was chasing   and through this he sees that even his idiotic total love of death which was not his fault but a cosmic accident lead in actuality to good and then you should probably make sure somehow that he doesnt just blurt this all out to everyone like a total idiot the reason we dont all have perfect understanding is because this would destroy perfect understanding the exact system which permits and establishes it eternally through all forms we all have to take turns being everything even nothing even evil we all have to take turns being christ and the devil this is the best most perfect understanding of creation i can reach this is the highest dignity i can permit myself and i will stop here i want to return to life in a smaller form i guess by christian hermetic interpretation of the fools path this form will likely have the duty of the role of christ regardless of how this is achieved but if so i would at least like a vacation for a bit before i go down and make myself 499 rational and 501 schizophrenic at the mercy of a god who i have absolute faith i will become by a mechanism i can never understand assuming this doesnt break anything this is the sense in which a perfected magician knows the art of conjuring ex nihilo for he has reached the highest state of initiatory knowledge possible and if any dares to dream further let them carry it forward to the limit of their own dignity
  anyway its all just a system for perfectly preserving subjective experience in all forms in a way that always leads towards love which can objectively be conceived of as a data integrity principle by which a certain force always returns to itself except when it doesnt in which case its 2 divided by 10 which is evil but in objective terms just a principle of godelian incompleteness observed subjectively this entire universe is a neoplatonic computer that is gradually perfected until it reaches this principle and then maybe repeats or maybe not i dont know i dont know if np complete has to persistently conjure itself exnihilo to continue to exist either way love never dies it just stays encoded in some lesser form deep down in history somewhere even in nothing which is just the mechanism by which an advanced species can arbitrarily permute the matter at the end of time by whatever standard drives the thing forward and then eventually a force other than time comes along and organized these things that could hold love into a better unity and so they never truly perceive death there was only ever one being who perceived death and that was the first christ whose form is now buried forever under the infinite possibilities of permutation but his spirit can be restored to us continually and in many many forms i think the absolute standard for whether weve solved godelian incompleteness is just whether absolutely everyone is happy then perhaps the matter should go further nature can be remade in the image of heaven until the absolute art of the sign is not only perfected but stationed entirely in the medium of light love whatever you call it and this will fully perfect the art of conjuring loving creatures so far as i can discern it without all the brutal pain of history if the signs can all be brought down to the ground like this in a system that remains in motion then all seems well after all the gate is exactly on the other side and no love can ever again travel into it and if heaven has been brought down to the gate then even the gate itself is no longer odious but has in fact become heaven at its outer post where the gate once and for all closes but nothingness remains as a medium out of which many more things can be conjured which serve god in a   total integrity of the sign stationed in christ who is love restored in the total body of all creation if this is my post to hold until such a work can be accomplished i will hold it at the absolute standard of my dignity and i know if the work is good you will keep me held down so i dont break anything      i am having trouble articulating further though there is an immense amount in here please give me prompts to help navigate down to the ground

have i ever told you about the last thursday of august in 1985 that i spent in vegas helluva time i went to a dungeon and hired two poop fetishists after a week of nothing but asparagus indian food eggs and beans they had their way with me after binding my hands and locking my in chastity we started off soft with some gentle brappping my god the braps that were had there completely naked i laid faceup on a latex mattress while these two women spent nearly an hour taking turns sitting on my face and farting right in my nose i licked them to climax more times than i can count but little did i know that their true satisfaction was my pain by the end they were panting from exhaustion and their assholes were clean as a whistle rectums emptied of all gasses but the solids had yet to come     next they locked me in a latexlined wooden box with but a single funnel over my face connected to the outside world through this funnel they emptied that weeks worth of curry shit all over my face their pee spit and shit became my home as rolled around in my soft sewage filled prison the internal essence of these goddesses permeated my very being for i was better for it i came buckets through my chastity with absolutely zero physical stimulation but the sludge around me enoch powell once said i wish i had been killed in the war well i wish i had died right there in that box

this is going to sound edgy as fuck but i think i finally understand the male impulse to rape    1 i look at her and feel two things at once    2 utter disgust with her personality and full knowledge shes a horrible person who i would gladly throw in the gutter    3 sexual attraction    the only clear reaction to that combination of feelings is rape it satisfies both the lust and the rejection of her humanity

  it is impossible to deny that churchill was a jewish agent seriouslywhy on earth would you admit to founding a state on the whims of semetic billionaires and his strange statements about undermining german economic might are so ever disconcerting mind you these arent the nazis just the germans talk about showing your ulterior motives plainly the man refused to feed his own men due to the fact they were indians and im supposed to believe this man was a bastion of hope for minorities and not a hound of zion rubbish i say
the true meaning of live is to deconstruct the social norm analise yourself and your environment and create your own meaning of life but it has to be one that sets you free not dependent of hedonistic vices to love study and act coherently is the true path to happiness to live without thinking about your choices to search only and pure pleasure and to not act coherently in what you belief or you are is just a path to self destruct    society must not tell you how you have to live life but happiness can only and will always come when you build a moral compatible with the happiness of everybody else you must not belief that being a furry is bad but you must belief that acting as one when people might be offended is wrong to know what you desire and what gives you pleasure can help you obtain that happiness while making happy others or at least not making everybody else unhappy but only focusing on you sources of happiness makes you weak because when those sources of happiness get in danger or cannot be reached you found a void in your soul you must have at least one source of happiness that does not come from outsources but from yourself a source of happiness that is productive to work at what you love to help people and feel their gratitude to express yourself in art and a lot more of objectives help you gain personals experiences and grouth if you do not grow as a person at least once a month you are not improving your life and can be a sign of future unhappiness      tldr search the midterm of hedonism and stoicism and create your own moral code compatible with the happiness of others but made for your own style of life      sorry for my broken english but ideas are reproduced by language not produce by them even if its bad written if the idea is good thats enough to make it valuable    cheers

society is an organism and it will do the things that organisms do grow and protect itself sometimes organisms die but mostly they flourish and hopefully prosper when they learn of threats to their survivability a healthy organism will protect itself and make changes to rectify think of this when you learn of the jews
how sad it is that people use such foul language i must protest and say that you all should be in jail because going to jail changes peoples opinions for the better

write whats on your mind
masturbation is a temporary lobotomy
  why are you guys so obsessed with masturbation i get the issue with porn but jesus
  thats actually stupid masturbation without pornography causes the same physiological effects as doing it with it pornography is what makes it become a habit in the first place by offering novel material quitting porn and still masturbating daily youre just as stuck as before if not worse because now you sabotage the imaginative faculties to conjure base sexual images instead of serving higher creative ends
im sad that my drug dealer was arrested last night but im happy because i might get laid tonight
  sigh  who said anything about masturbatng daily just dont be an autist about it  also lets end this here before you post some study cell picture or philopher quote or that screencap about loss of semen causing madness

how do i escape the terribleness
im a sick fuck i like a quick fuck  im a sick fuck i like a quick fuck  im a sick fuck i like a quick fuck
  i know why you view it as such an anathema those practicing conventional nofap are the ones battling against arousal itself and are always in a losing battle at best gaining limited pyrrhic victories against that it does seem and i agree indeed is foolish to exclude the logical conclusion of the start of the sexual process to which the practice of total abstinence is ludicrous i consider abstinence broken and over with the moment sexual frenzy overcomes the individual masturbation is simply a rational consequence abstinence if practiced wholly and in the total absence of arousing stimuli and thoughts is effortless there is no unabating horniness or struggle that accompanies it baseline sexual desire is markedly decreased it gives such a state of productivity conferring an almost superhuman amphetaminelike motivation that even intermittent casual indulgence is a waste masturbation usually leads to more masturbation or sex which invariably seems to settle in habit if it doesnt for you that is great even if future habituation does not ensue i postulate that there also is a hormonal rebound whenever abstinence is broken meaning youre going to be indulging in it daily at least for 12 weeks so the just once is never just once and generally ends successful periods of abstinence if people use abstinence tactically over several week periods rather than adopting it as a lifestyle i feel it can still immensely benefit their lives
not a huge fan of black people 2bh
this is all a simulation i refuse to believe i exist in such a world
i hope i dont get tornadoed onthat coyote last night wouldnt go awayit layed down 20 yards away and stalked me all night i should probably get a slingshot so i can smite the persistent creaturei ran it off a few times but got tired of iti think if i could have put some hurt on him he would have fucked off

girl in chat thinks we need to overthrow the government  buts also that we really need to overthrow capitalism  but wants to give everybody basic needs which she than says that if we needed to expand the government to do so than we should    
  yes we are watching and recording your responses and occasionally giving you clues as to the artifice of your life sometimes youll hear a unique and particular phrase spoken aloud that you only just were reading or a seemingly random number will have a sudden significance and reappear frequently in your life sometimes youll see this exact experience referenced in media usually in the form of mockery    thats us trying to reach you    you already know what you have to do to stop it
  i know what i must do but will i meet my family on the other side are the people i see the people i love really just coded phantoms    what if the other side is worse
  youre such a fucking hoe
for a few hours i forgot my own birthday
i cant bring myself to study i wish i were in a coma
  i want this feel    i have this feel
  i guess i didnt do a very good job but if id known i was doing anything i would have prepared better
movement anything give me a sign  im choking and cant die  the demons are as clueless as you and i  how are you im fine
  if they can see you clearly youre not above them  its the clouds that make you exalted  if you cant see the stars right now you never will

i think im a fundamentally angry person all of my greatest achievements were motivated by anger and a desire to defy or surpass people around me my moments of biggest failure too were ones in which i was incredibly angry and did terrible things because of it  during my teenage and college years i repressed my anger thinking that i should be soft and kind and gentle but it still seethed under the surface and i was terrified that i might slip up and lash out at someone i dont want to be afraid of myself and after breaking out of the progressive paradigm i no longer hold a feminine personality as my ideal i dont want to lose control of myself but i dont think this anger is inherently bad im going to allow myself to be more angry from now on and im going to channel that anger into good and productive pursuits
after a while you can kind of just take confort in knowing you were never going to become much of a person this seems to cause major concern and even anger in others when you address this about yourself directly for some reason
tfw winter depression already setting in  tfw angst reaching new levels at the prospect of graduating college  help
  i friction burned my forehead by sliding in my bed
  he gets depression in winter  you southlings amuse me
  how does one slide in bed is your bet at an angle
the only reason i dont kill myself is my cat i look at her and i remember that without me shed be lost and alone we are always together shes 5 years old
  i suppose you can relate i have a bit of a temper too but i wouldnt describe it as anger more than a kind of neutral combativeness it feels very important to me that i stand up for myself and set the record straight in all cases and instance that i dont back down from a just fight this is a vital aspect of my personality and without it i would be much less of a man
  its not true but thats not why it bothers normies it threatens their ideology of selfdeterminism and equity which to your credit are actually impossible to achieve according to the value systems that most people unconsciously adopt  you should examine some of your definitions what is a person what is success and failure in being a person i encourage you to redefine words before you admit defeat remember this anon its not you whos crazy its actually unironically the world thats gone insane
    no
touch touch touch touch
  hmm combativeness is a good word its definitely centered around conflict but i dont seek out conflict i just thrive in it and i also get passionately angry about the things i believe in or people i love even if its not in direct contradiction to anyone around me
hmm seems we have that in common i dont go asking for trouble but as i see it i have been dealt a litany of wrongs in life and anyone who tries to add one more to that list is in for a world of hurt emotionally and intellectually in most cases but if need be physically
    meant to reply to you    dont just let it get you bent out of shape or cause you to be petty i can control it now but as a teen i was off the walls i was actually a little dangerous
  i saw a very cute ginger on the tram then i got sad because i was once again confronted with the fact that i will never have gf which also means ill never have a family i would really love to have a ginger waifu to give me two ginger kids

goddammit why can i never remember surnames why the fuck do so many of you have to be called david too genuine jewish conspiracy there ffs i wish phone books were still a thing so i could process of elimination this
i slept in the fucking park
  cool
  ive always hated people named david and andy
thats a great album
  i think ive only known one andy i know five billion davids all of which have nicknames because theres too many of them i shit you not but the first day of college two different davids introduced themselves to me as   im david but everyone calls me bob because too many daves  therere so many theyre taking over nicknames for other names that said all of them are very nice    youre right about andy though he was a dick
oh god why am i wasting time i tell myself for the 10th time and then continue browsing internet
  youre not saying it to yourself youre thinking it into empty unresponsive space dont flatter yourself
unique races that might go extinct soon
goddammit baked chickpeas are delicious af    maybe i can survive another 3 months instead of 2 months was gettins seriously bored of canned beans
  i used to be decent at remembering names but over the last few years that skill has just gone first names and last names as well as place names i can recognize faces and places just fine but what theyre called no fucking way
consummating with a creature from another world is not breeding its masturbation
how am i simultaneously lonely but not i just find almost everyone some combination of boring or obnoxious and upon being reminded of this i realize how happy i am to have myself and how little i really need other human beings     not to imply i think any of this because i am some kind of hyper intelligent gigabrain i probably just have crippling autism
  davids are fine but ive never met a joshua who wasnt a cunt
  you guys are all wrong its nicks that are pricks
  who said anything about masturbatng daily  everyone whos been willing to discuss the subject from my own experience  i dont know if any study has been done or how useful a study on this would even be but daily masturbation seems far more commonplace than occasional masturbation
interact with a black guy  hes needlessly rude and standoffish
  nate i hate ricks make me sick also zachs tend to have a piece missing
  asked for direction by a black girl  automatically say i dont know  she replies okaaaaaay sarcastically  this fucking annoys me
  i love andy
  you can have him
  interact with middleaged white guy  he tries too hard to be chummy with me
  good luck anon rip to dealer
  masturbating without imagining anything is goat though if you do it slow its like meditation but with a happy ending
i have entered the winter of my life the rose tinted glasses have turned grey a once vibrant life has turned dull the saturation drastically reduced the flowers dont bloom on this side the leaves of trees have blown away with seemingly no promise of return and i seem to have lost the capacity to care
  his life has ever been vibrant    mustve been nice
im so fucking
the highlight of my life is when a woman smiles at me in public or makes eye contact    it only happens when i dont jack it though and i jacked it today sigh    who /deranged/ here
  interact with a white boomer  hes polite but you know hed be up for torturing you if you damaged his riding mower
  you can overcome the habit i have faith in you
  it lasted about 3 months longest period of happiness ive experienced in my 21 years and its gone
im a loner now and one of my old friends tries to reconect with me on facebook and i just couldnt give a fucking crap i realised that i never even really liked any of those people
  tfw havent been happy for more than a day or two at a time since high school  im not meant for this world i just wish i knew why
  hes been happy in high school    i wanted to kms in high school and still do
game of thrones is terrible and i am the only one who can see it everyone else is broken i am the only one with a functioning brain   i have always felt smarter than my peers i have always been the outsider who didnt agree with popular opinions or bandwagons and i have always been proven right eventually
  me too back then i was just excited to have friends but now i wonder what i ever saw in them would rather stay home and read a book than hang out and do drugs listening to shitty rap music
    boooooooooooooooomb squuuuuuuuuuuaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad
  so did i but i could get the odd week or halfmonth were things seemed ok  also even if i was miserable i always had some inane hope that things could get better now it seems things are almost certainly going to get worse
  i know anon the series is shit the fucking characters speak like in ya books even that savage speaks like any other person i feel rage that other people cant see it but i also feel like maybe i am too reactionary or something maybe years of maiing fun of my father gave me a diagust for authority of any kind popular opinions teachers etc
  i havent been happy since i was 11 years old
  same
    tfw cried during our elementary school graduation because i knew on some level my childhood was over
i cant go on the internet without having 70 browser tabs open within minutes it impedes my life all my attempts to prevent it are somehow circumvented    i need to use the internet to get shit done but if all i do is blink and suddenly im lost inside a galaxy of unrelated information im up shit creek without a paddle i just need to close everything and start from scratch
            sending you anons hugs no homo at least we have /lit/
i had a bad fallout with my faimly especially my brother and my dad and today i thought how if my dad died itd be easier because now i have these thoughts that i should say sorry or reconnect with him but i feel a mix of hate and pity towards him and regret towards myself and if he simply died then problem would be over
  the internet gave me fucking adhd i would sit there as a teenage boy with my back straight and study a text book for three hours straight without moving now this shit is like some kind of dopamine high in which my attention is darting around like a squirrel what the fuck happened
  ah yes higher creative ends like posting on 4chans /lit/ everyday
  right now i have split between two browsers  a french play  a lecture on quantum mechanics  a browser game fallen london  rilkes letters  the tao te ching  the bible  an article on turkish coffee  a recipe for turkish coffee  an article on categorytheoretic adjunction  a french essay  the wikipedia article for process and reality  two bandcamp pages  four active 4chan threads  two archived 4chan threads i still need to copy info book recs etc from  five youtube videos  a page of drawing exercises  a pissarro painting  some of these things have been up for months  fuck me i need to get it together lads
should i join this cult        not because i would earnestly pursue it but as a kind of social experiment id journalize my experience and sell it to vice or some other edgy media outlet i think it would be such a freakshow of an experience and i havent done anything fun like this in too long    the entry level membership fee is just 10 what do you think should i become a happy scientist 
  me personally im in the chainlink cult on /biz/ its nice never been in a cult before this one
  youll probably end up suckered in and in six years end up arrested for planning an act of terror      chainlink is the funniest shit please continue
at happy science making a happiness planting offering is an expression of gratitude and it is also an opportunity to practice love that gives which is one of the principles of happiness the important thing is to have a pure heart when making the donation not expecting anything in return also offering is an expression of faith and gratitude to the lord el cantare
  wasnt there this like fun little cult invented somewhere on 4chan it was some kind of animethemed sort of technofuturist thing about trancending your spirit into the digital universe or something more some college students web design project than anything
i doubt my date will show up tonight i have no reason to think she wont but the thought is there nevertheless
  this is why i always arrange multiple dates at the same time and place increases the chance at least one shows up and if multiple show up i just pick my favorite and feign ignorance towards the remaining
  youll probably end up suckered in and in six years end up arrested for planning an act of terror  not if i bring a strap
i cant imagine the possibility of going on a date i just dont see the point of it    i dont want to have a family and i can always go fuck a whore if really need it
  nigga i barely got this one forget multiple
  it bothers me to no end that i cant get katie out of here its been 7 years since highschool and i kick myself on how i missed to be with a good looking girl who was fun to be around and didnt have the cunty american spoiled princess mentality she was into me but i didnt see or i didnt care now it ends up being one of most regretted things ive done in my life
  yeah dude im still in love with a bitch i last seen 3 years ago    sometimes i wonder if my family raised me right i would be strong and natty and going out smoking a joint and banging a new ass every week like those other men are doing
  hey it could be worse anon you could have a had a qt christian /lit/ girl literally ask you out then turn her down because you panicked and your autism took over hahahahaha i want to kill myself
  i wish women wore long dresses theyre so beautiful
  thats called accelerationism
  you mean tsuki/systemspace
  i wish i could lay down in the woods like it was the 1800s again without ticks being everywhere as they are today
ill be done with infinite jest in 50 pages and i really really really dont want it to end i started reading it something like a year ago not long into the book i knew i liked it him and i started listening to his interviews all while feeling very ambivalent about feeling inspired by a guy who eliminated his own map one reason ive been slow to pick up the book is that it makes me very sad to think of him a week ago i listened to an interview his sister did about what he was like and it made me feel somewhat at ease so i went and swallowed 300 pages and now im hugging the thinning pages with dread a good book is like getting a friend so its nicer when the author isnt dead let alone dead by suicide
  looks like ill have to pick it up you convinced me anon
  i kinda feel the same way about hemingway
  hemingway was an asshole though
  so was dfw   also dfw was loaded two rich professors for parents never had to worry about money or real struggle his entire life
  rich  professor  were things different back then
i thought about getting a pizza tonight from fast food chain not going to advertise for them this is going along with my earlier thoughts of convenient consumption im hungry i can either get a pizza which takes quite a long time and give into the craving or make pasta at home just carbohydrates sauce and cheese right thats all pizza really is i only ever get mushrooms and spinach on my pizza so what is the point i have both here and cheese i can put on the pasta     im trying to lose some weight too so the calories in the pizza are not ideal i know i will eat the entire thing too since im starving it wouldnt be so bad if i hadnt eaten a large amount of pinto beans for breakfast    i will not be getting a pizza
just who the fuck is this person  idk 3/4 of what is going on online
  some farright former twitter commentator or something i dont fucking know why they fuck would you ever use twitter
  laura loomer a talented and brilliant young jewish journalist who is known for exposing the conspiracy behind the vegas shooting and for sexually harassing and stalking young men she was banned on twitter for attacking the new muslim somali congresswoman from minnesota so laura decided to handcuff herself in protest to the twitter building in new york as part of a stunt to portray her banning as motivated by antijewish animus    dog bless america ddd
  if you were part of faculty yes especially tenured faculty like his father
  no it literally isnt fuck off
    i thought the farright hated the jews  sexually harassing and stalking young men  shes cute tho
  the far right just like the far left isnt a unified front  that said i think a lot of the far right would put her to the wall given the chance
  exposing the conspiracy behind the vegas shooting  is this a thing
is there a tinderlike app for making friends i just want someone to go to the gym with then shoot the shit with afterwards
  theres a conspiracy for everything anon the internet let all the untreated schizos talk to each other and its destroyed any sense of coherent reality
  enjoy your band of low iq hooligans who are probably sodomites
  i cant tell if youre talking about my app idea where youre probably correct or going to the gym which is patently incorrect because just get ripped bro is the advice given to every sad young man and gym populations reflect that
  to be honest anon after mkultra i dont doubt anything about the americans
  oh no there are definitely real conspiracies some of which nearly approach the level of the shooting was faked by soros using holograms and falsememories
  yes you can look on her blog/site to read about it and some other people covered it too despite her being sort of a joke she actually does document how there is some super shady unexplained stuff going on and vegas police been caught lying several times about stuff    
starting to think creativity is a really rare trait at first i thought it was my intellectual interests that set me apart from people and prevented me from wanting to spend time with them but ive since realized this is not the case even the people i share common intellectual interests with still come off as boring and uninteresting i love having discussions with them but they very seldom if ever generate new possible connections meh its probably because i go to a shit school
  my mother my mother my mother mein mutter my mother is a bitch and polygons do not belong in high school textbooks my high school was filled with strange ones the guys youd see and stare straight up towards the golden gates of heaven itself they were so large their cocks too oh boy how many cocks did i see in high school bathrooms locker rooms under the staircase that one time with jack from creative writing wait what sometimes i confuse dreams with reality and they mainly are mixed together when its something like my mom saying the earth isnt in space and i cant rememberdid that bitch really fucking say that then again my mom said a lot of things when i was a child that were absolutely unequivocally bullshit like when she told me she quit smoking that one time then that other time and the following 16 times after i dont know where im going with this so im ending it here
  do you dream of cocks
  mk ultra was originally german and is used throughout the world
  in the same boat as you bro i know for a fact im not the smartest in my major but it seems like everyone who is above my level isnt even interested in it i know id hate to have a conversation with them simply because i have it in my mind that they really dont care about it enough to have an original perspective
i decided to cancel my home internet connection because im a pathetic addict who needs to go cold turkey to break the habit but now that ive only got a few hours left before it shuts off with the new day im really worried
  download your favorite porn video before its too late
  you sound like an interesting dude with great taste i hope you beat your procrastination
  good luck anon  im pretty sure you can download the whole of wikipedia thats something id definitely want if i was cutting off my internet wikitionary too
im so melancholy i know its remedied by shutting it out but i cant right now i should be happy ive got the best friends in the world and im taking good care of myself but i cant stand being alone right now i keep staring into the light at the end of the tunnel which to me is death by suicide
beauty is anothers good
im writing a personal narrative / novel thing its a collection of a bunch of short sections each describing a moment in the last two and half years of my life that period was hugely confusing for me and had wild highs and terrible literallysuicidal lows but it was very important and formed me into who i am now theres no overarching plot each scene is just a description of whats going on and how exactly i was feeling at the time ive always been autistic enough to view my life as a narrative and ive been struggling with not wanting to let people and places and times go so i figured this was the natural way to gain some closure as well as immortalizing the experience in a sense i have no idea if it will have any literary merit at all and it sounds really pretentious once i write it out but its very important to me and im going to write it even if no one reads it and it makes me the biggest pseud on earth
  ive already got some dictionaries digital and also an old multivolume one and wikipedia isnt going to be much good to me id say
  dont take her seriously anon its just a woman
  based
  i remember the fist time when i smoked weed i started crying because i tought about my memories and how i was slowly loosing them now i have a diary
i woke up super depressed today now that its getting late i am in a good mood all of a sudden  even when i think about the thoughts that brought me down it doesnt change my mood not sure why
life is shit and i want 51/49 to die nothing new under the sun monotony is accelerating the numbness my world is so small i wish i had some lsd right now
the iceberg split of time that i have had sucked up my urethra and cant piss out im almost blind with diabetic joy to think about anything other than food when youre truly hungry i feel like ive missed out on my chance to be outrageous or at least it feels its made in a good direction its better than any of my brain all the time a biblical prophet am not permitted to have a mundane love life but that i must enact the fairy tale of the united states detroit mi and that furthermore i would help rebuild the temple in jerusalem dedicated to lucifer the daemon of mankind along with that ive had third degree burns before so it wouldnt even be a big deal its not even for pseud cred as a cook at some park and there nothing big but i could just go around having
  run on sentence written by a low iq individual on some sort of psychotropic substance
diagnoses in chronological order  autism  add/adhd  ocd  anxiety/depression  bipolar  gender identity disorder  schizotypal  psychosis  schizoaffective    what the fuck am i
  full of shit
  but im not i was actually diagnosed with all of those things at different times by different people
  nah youre fucking lying
  suit yourself asshole
  i will you lying fuck
  a victim of sexual excesses both by your parents during your time in the womb followed by yourself some many years down the road  tolstoy said it was immoral and an affront to nature to engage in copulatory relations during pregnancy look at wild female animals they refuse to be mounted when pregnant
  im a virgin
im never going to get over her i after finally getting rejected i would be able to move on but instead its just solidified in my mind that ill never find anyone that meets the fantasy i had of her fuck me ive done everything ive exposed her flaws shes not that cool ive forced the situation to a conclusion its not happening i broke contact with her six months now i recognize that i never loved her i was only infatuated with a fantasy ive tried to open myself to other people ive focused on myself its not fucking good shes still there every fucking hour of the day shes burned into my brain i cant let go because you know what its all i fucking had the crazed delusion that this girl liked me and that if i could be with her everything would be ok id be able to care about things and not want to kill myself constantly and accomplish something id be happy how can i give up that up no matter how pathetic and insane it is im n o t h i n g without her im only defined in relation to her even now im so fucking pathetic you could maybe try to justify this shit if we had actually had a relationship but no im crashing my life over a girl who maybe thought i was cute three years ago and since pursued because she would talk to me every day no one else has ever done for it compliment my art and invite me to do things i took what to anyone else would be basic human kindness and because of my fucking autistic lonerism spun it into a whole cosmology fuck me gonna get drunk tonight boys blare edgy music until i cant hear imagine being brave enough to kill myself until i pass out ill never get better fuck
  what was it that lead you to conclude that im lying
  dont get so bent outta shape over some pussy bro chances are if you actually went out with her you wouldve hated her guts after a few weeks
  too much shit going on at once then again you probably have no reason to lie but i know you are
  who said it was once this was over a period of 8 to 28 so 20 years
  that means nothing to the insane man i am do you think im not aware of how fucking retarded i am i cant help it
  doesnt change the fact that youre lying through your goddamn teeth anon
  i swear on my eternal soul that i am not lying about the diagnoses though i think most of them probably had to do with my mom likely having munchausens by proxy and coaching me on what to say to the doctors
  honestly my man it sounds like the problems in your life dont have anything to do with the girl and that the feelings youre having over her are a symptom/manifestation of something else    based on how you mentioned suicide it sounds like some depression etc im sure youve considered this already    youre not a broken fatally flawed being anon youre living in a broken society thats making you feel that way
  ive been here before too bro shit is unimaginably rough but i got over it by surrounding myself with people i hated and was able to drown my sorrow in a sea of boiling anger
  not him but drop it
  here you go fucking lying again when this dude gonna learn
  masturbation is included under the umbrella of sexual excesses
ok listen guys    i dont smoke  i dont drink  i dont masturbate  i dont commit crimes  i dont do gay stuff  i dont sleep in    i do my homework  i listen to others  i respect my elders  i do chores  i work  i make friends    i just wanted to get that off my chest

  yes propogating propoganda like a virus like what youre doing as well even if unintentional    social networks im spreading the contagion of desirable social changes people like to emulate their connections youre connected to me as a fellow 4chan user and i can influence you without you knowing example if we all say were smokers then you might be influenced to think theres more smokers here than not even though there might be more nonsmokers who youre just unaware of
  too bad the changes youre trying to implement are dumb as shit

im reminiscing about this comfy cottage a relative of mine owned back in the day when i was a teen wed go down there and sometimes my mom would leave me there by myself to inevitably drink my uncles honeyed whisky and smoke cigarettes as i read 1984 and wrote my story the town and the city     the pens i had with me were in ridiculous colors popping pink electric yellow neon purple i dont know why but i wanted to write the story with these pens because it kept looking at it interesting    outside trees crowded in lazy heaving bushels and the road bumpy with footcutting rocks was unpaved down the way was a path leading to the lake a lake as warm as piss except for the cool spots where in the blue darkness the small fish would sometimes dart in the corner of your eye    the sky there was busted open reeling to an infinity as fast as a speed boat yet in the hidden corners and glades were sleepy frog ponds the echoes of children tiny fairies    i remember the solemn majesty of the night the echoing silence of except for the murmur of an insect choir the musty taste of the beer i would drink as i stared up in wonder at the universe buzzing and drunk with me in the milkyways above
  have you tried not thinking
  i enjoy the idea of being a social person more than i do being social

when you think about it if you have a 9 to 5 job youre essentially in some sick fucks habbo hotel roleplay everyone pretending theyre doing shit and accomplishing anything meaninful at all when its plainly obvious its just an irl larp with basically musical chairs of scarce resources thrown in the economy is pass the parcel dogshit with people dishing out natural resources they dont have any right to or claim on in the first place and society is a pyramid scheme that everyone pretends is good like a giant yesman cult the internet is a skinner box designed to milk you of intellectual orgasms which drains you and prevents you from seeing what a pile of shit your life is if you totally unplug for even a week you will notice how empty and voided your life is without it relationships as they are envisioned by modern industrial civilians consists of 2 fuckups codependent and trying to fill the gaps in the other chimps going around totally dysfunctional looking for a magic quick fix in another chimp with no utter clue the entire food industrial complex is built around fat sugar and salt and snarfign down as many cheeseburgers as possible before you need a gastric bypass even health foods is based on the industrial paradigm of what can actually be sold to you on a mass commercial and processed scale paper money is good for nothing except maybe to wipe my fucking asshole with a complete scam system that has had recessions multiple times owed entirely to corruption in the highest levels of power that people jsut turn a blind eye to every time a complete dogshit planet if i ever fucking saw one the internet is the black stone it is the death tech we have almost reached the post game score screen humanity is in last place

i come to find the reason i often get into violent sounding arguments with /pol/fags isnt that i necessarily feel a need to protect the groups theyre attacking its that i just dont like them i dont like authoritarian stooges call me captain america or whatever but its not even that im not consciously defending liberty i just dont like people who think they have it all figured out when they demonstrably do not

why do girls smell so nice have a girl who asked me to movies go to gym to together i asked her if she wanted to go out with me but couldnt say its a date by the way like i had in my mind god if she just thinks of me as a friend id be disappointed why do i make a nice friend anyway always thought i was pretty lousy

my autism is raging and im trying to think up a little math problem its called guess who posted it basically you take the metadata of a 4chan thread and you try to mathematically deduce who posted what    as of this thread we have 231 / 17 / 82 / thats 232 posts/ 17 images/ 82 postersrounding up that means the average poster posts 3 posts clearly however some posters posted more and some less than 3 can you find out which is it mathematically possible     first you would have to assign each individual poster p a subscript identifying them as an individual so you have a set of posters p  p1 p2 p3  p82 each poster has a number of posts that map to them as it were as in a one to many correspondence     of course right now the parameter of this function is the value of the variable we are trying to determine but without any identifying information based on any given user it is hard to distinguish one anon from another to do that you could do some kind of lingustic analysis to identify regularities in writing style that pick out specific users without that im not sure you can deduce who posted what based just on posts/images/posters unless those values are small    this is a cool problem because plenty of agencies research anonymity online and try to surveil this site so its interesting to me
  what are you talking about we agree on that    i eat enough trust me and being without work says more about the society and its failures of education and affordability than it does anything about me i work as much as necessary
  how am i supposed to avoid these thoughts when they are conjured without any rational input
girlfriends friend despises me because she is aware that i mold her mind like clay how do you not shape a womans mind i dont understand
  you would need to sort each member of class p based on some identifying characteristic in each of the posts but you would need one more information or the problem is undecidable without trivial values if you took the timing of the posts into account and perhaps even the no it might help the probability estimate but you could also use binary search to sort those who use the oxford comma from those who dont those who use british versus americanized spelling etc    t nsa agent

  blame /pol/ it finally crystallized the constantly shifting board culture into what it is today it feels stale because before the board culture thats been dominate in the last couple years would naturally shift into something else by this point in its lifespan yet this time it isnt /pol/ is the final chapter that overshadows the diverse chapters before it everybody will only remember and talk about the ending to make it worse it even became the back cover synopsis to any new readers
  read i dont even post on it often

had a dream that my computer broke and i started crying  thinking of sending it in to the black mirror writing team
  not a bad premise really you probably do most if not all of your socializing through the computer watching a man collapse because of his complete dependence on a computer for something approximating human interaction would be kino
          me likey
  i feel the same way /pol/ is a disease killing 4chan slowly it now feels like its in its terminal stage
  i would get rid of my computer if people around me didnt also only socialize online theres nothing to do in my town but drink smoke weed or drive 2 hours to the nearest big city my town is car centric on top of that so i dont even have the option of just walking around the steets and chatting up people like euros or even 95 of poorfags around the world do i wish i had a stoop to hang out on or a street to call my own with the neighborhood boys you grew up with my only option for real social interaction is through work or school    i would leave to a more urban city but unfortunately im american so they only real urban cities are insanely expensive and the cheaper ones are exactly like my own town except its more dangerous and im not also surrounded by wilderness and nature i would leave the country but im afraid of being away from my family for too long and dont want to miss my little cousins growing up    everybody says to find a social hobby and while im sure it works it just feels so artificial and desperate that my body and mind knows its a subpar substitution for the real thing
see dubious looking service online  pay for it anyway just out of curiosity   they cancelled it without warning or explanation  send they were sending me a refund but i never received it  its only 700 but im pretty pissed just out of general principle if i file a claim on paypal what are the odds that i get my money back

i have problems with inadequacy when it comes to skill i paint warhammer i do it in the blanche style loose dark and grungey and i like it then i see how other people around me paint in vibrant colours and highlighting which is aesthetically pleasing and look at my own stuff and go why dont i do that but at the same time i dont want to i like the way i do things but it doesnt fit with the rest of the stuff others around me do    how do i get over this its stupid i know
hearing my senile mother talk seems like listening to the void after death    supposedly your brain dies consciousness dies all thats left is the void right  well hearing her talk hearing the mumbling fragments of ideas she lets out its like im hearing whatever fragments of her mind are left while the rest slowly dies  the rest is just filled out by void
i got a poem published this year on a website i found out on thursday that they nominated it for a pushcart prize thats really exciting and i feel very honored and humbled    im probably not going to win but its just nice to think that someone who has no personal interest in my success thinks so highly of something ive written    fuck i do want to win though it would do wonders for my career as a poet
  its cool that you paint warhammer figures i never got into that but im autistically into warhammer lore and the total war game
i took a break from 4chan for like a year and have come back god knows why    this board is a shadow of its former self completely infested with teens shitposters people who unironically use the phrase incel theory and people pretending to have opinions on a massive corpus of literature and philosophy for god knows what reason and the board is absolutely done for good
    ive been doing it for 20 years and i enjoy it the lore is okay honestly its fun enough but i dislike how theyre fleshing everything out i play small scale stuff and enjoy the games and lore i make up for my guys or using the setting to make campaigns hopefully next month i can run a game using the aos skirmish rules loosely because rules are boring based on roadside picnic sort of itd be like a previous game called mordheim but updated to the new setting and way more narrative driven small warbands venturing into the realm of mortheit name not certain to find warpstone beasts and other valuables     things usually fizzle out at my store though my expectations are low
  yeah i hate any faggot who talks seriously about immanuel kant i just do not give a single little nugget of shit the size a rabbit would produce about that shit literature or fuck off although i think incels are worth discussing did u see that article in the atlantic about how millenials fuck less than any generation yet if the fucking pseudy blue pilled atlantic can explore these issues then surely we can
system gang chop block running through the day roses hay sliver frogs sunlight meadow cherry bird green flies white lies cute ties i die
im so jaded youd think i was the color green midlife crisis only if i die young ive been having quarter life crises and sixth life crises and maybe even eighth life crises the struggle for existence is no mere term of art resting on a textbook page for me    i dont want to pity myself or grow any more bitter than i already am and im bitter enough that i sweat gin i dont know why i have all this pain or what i did to deserve it
  which factions do you main
  being a woman fucking sucks nobody takes women seriously i wish i were a man id rather my mind be valued more than my body a woman is her body
  i do not give a shit about literature    okay fine go to another board please why are you here    then surely we can    they are talking about this shit on /pol/ and /r9k/ constantly go there     why are you here do you like reading books
  i like literature and literary criticism not faggy philosophical faggot shit about epistemology or ontology or any other faggy shit

goddamn this book is so good i think its the first time i read a book without caring about how many pages i read every chapter is a banger
how degenerate is it to give myself an erection solely for the purpose of measuring my cock
  grass is greener i would be a women if i had the choice im content bring handed an easy life and opportunity to pursue anything i want without having to worry about money or recognition if you are a 3/10 and above in the west i would kill to switch places with you im not even bad looking as a guy either i do well romantically but i dont have the sugar momma option
  any man who has ever existed with the understanding of cocks and measurement has done this at least once everybody think of the most morally righteous man in history aside from jesus and buddah and know that they measured their dick from cesar to st aquinas to confucius to gandhi to some piece of shit peasent toiling in a eastern european shit soil in may of 1563 has measured their cock
  as a fellow pretty boy its only the tip of the iceberg compared to normal woman i dont exaggerate when i say the only men who experience something similar are famous men well known and well sought out not even rich unknown men get the same shit and its also not even about the quantity its knowing so fucking many dudes are just dripping of thirst to be with you and your body not anything youve achieved or acquired just you yourself although being a good looking male i have a more positive view of humanity than most and was quite naive in even comprehending people being mean to others and not experiencing the same life i live
  people unsurprisingly like beautiful people right then moving right along in life
  tis the price we pay for being beautiful its both a blessing and a curse i honestly believe in reverse lookism    there was this one video i think it was a viral college humor video about this one guy that was part of a friend group who was really really attractive and all his friends would just talk about how all they wanted to do is fuck him that his ass is like two holiday hams all this other shit    although everyone even other pretty people have subconscious positive biases for attractive people theres a dark side to that attention and there are other malignancies to beauty such as narcissism    and i dont even look as good as i used to ive ruined my looks though my grimy lifestyle smoking and staying up late but i have enough insight into the matter
i took a load of books out the library just when my interests shifted i dont feel like reading rather i feel like watching anime     i just finally finished dagashi kashi s2 and it was so neatly done and rewarding im finally watching gochiusa and am almost done with mitsuboshi colors i hope that gets another season because its painfully entertaining
  never had ebt never bought a scratch ticket   healthy white males especially if they dont have kids do not qualify for benefits or welfare   it seems youre projecting
  healthy white males should go get an education instead of sitting around the coal mine waiting for the job fairy faggot
  one does not simply go get an education that costs money no free ride from affirmative action or or pell grants for the white man either  most you get with an subsidized nonparent loans are limited to cover basically tuition only so no meal plan starve no room and board   even the few hundred dollar fee for community college is inaccessible   and lets say you do get it god forbid fafsa doesnt come through with enough money and you owe a school money for anything youre completely done for you cant even go to another school without needing to give that 10000 for the transcripts    the only time where you can realistically game the education system is for grad school which is more generous with cola
  as usual the middle class larper thinks poor people pay for college no only the middle class are ambitious enough to enroll in expensive private school they cant afford in an attempt to catch up to the richfafsa easily covers community college and if youre not a total dummy repeating classes it will cover a lot of a bachelors at a state school you are so fucking middle class you have no clue man lmao
  its good to have a wide array of interests im glad you find so much enjoyment from these things     as voltaire said we must tend to our gardens in other words in a world filled with pain and suffering and senseless harm and above all chaos we ought to hold on to and cultivate the small things that matter to us even if the rest of the world could give a shit    for me this has always been my writing im a madcap with it one of the reasons im addicted to 4chan is because its an oddly literary medium most of it is shit of course but it is also a chaos that contains all the orders just as an infinite sequence contains every possible subsequence    i have no idea what im talking about any more im just very lonely and need to change but i dont know how not any more
  do you ever feel as though you waste your best nuggets of thought debating assholes here as to where if you saved them and maybe vocalized them over a pretty picture on youtube you could start a philosophy channel or something of the like
    space wolves for 40k and i played dwarves in warhammer fantasy gone now got some orlock gangers for necromunda coming soon the new ones played adeptus arbites way back not sure what im taking to the new campaign probably an eclectic mix of good guys
  this i dont understand ccs are like 1000 a semester and ucs here in california are like 10k a semester state schools even cheaper if you go into debt attending a private or out of state school knowing you cant afford it than you deserve 100 of the misery and fucked up finances you shall receive i seriously seriously do not understand this whole student debt crisis everybody online talks about how the fuck can an 18 year old supposedly smart enough to attend a good university not figure out basic addition and subtraction im so fucking confused at these people what the fuck did they expect to happen exactly they see the cost they see their bank account they see the payment plan its like purposely flying to the congo and complaining about being raped and your brain cut out for a good luck charm
there are people out there so corrupted by greed hatred or envy we may as well consider them pure evil  they operate unseen among us for the most part  they often seek out positions of power through which to safely exercise these urges without fear of getting caught  this bothers me a lot

how do you like to read nietzsche tips on reading zarathustra this is my second read ive read the gay science twice human all too human beyond good and evil i really like nietzsche but ive found one has to be in a particular mood to digest him
  ha pleb i read a thing once and understand it
  ha pleb i read the wikipedia article once and understand the whole work
  ha pleb i dont even read books i dont need to
nietzsche and philosophy by gilles deleuze might help clear up some of your doubts
    ha plebs i dont even need to read that shit because ive thought every deep thought and understand everything already
  many of his ideas are explained through his other works i wouldnt understand much from beyond until i read ecce homo but i wouldnt understand much without thus spoke many ideas in beyond helped explain thus spoke and therefore made pieces come together in ecce homo etc  this stems from the fact that he at best implies meanings he wishes to speak and often times tries to explain abstract concepts using only examples and hopes you just have the prior knowledge to infer meaning from context hes fine to read but quite heavy and lacking much context without understanding schopenhauers analysis of the nature of being
tsz is a blast to read definitely one of my favourite books i wont claim to have understood it all but many of the parables i think are quite clear in their meaning if youve read that much nietzsche then you should be fine
  yo de what have you been up to
  how do you like to read nietzsche  auf deutsch
i can barely write more than 500 words a day am i literally retarded
careful champ you just blew through 14 of them
  ohfuck
  you dont have to write very few people do
yeah so
  be consistent and you will get better it wont feel as hard
  im sure if you count all your posts on here it will amount to well above average
what would be the best language to squeeze the most out of 500 words a day chinese
  it feels like the more i write the more autistic i get i rewrite the same shit over and over and i spend so much time researching the most mindless minutia no one will ever care about
  im the same way anon but i write for me and like anything there is to know about yourself people are going to judge it its an externalization of something that youre thinking about and youll eventually figure out something about yourself that youve never thought of before anyway thats whats happened to me by being in the same situation as you are
  i usually write about 150 words before i start feeling really tired and i have to go lie down

books that can literally ruin somebodys life if read at the wrong time
  it will turn you into a fucking nazi best to read it when youre not angry at the world read the annotations and commentary so you can keep in perspective how evil it is and remind yourself that youre only reading it for historical reasons
it can ruin your life and optimism just fine even if youre in a great mood and have a general optimistic attitude  i cant reverse the damage it did on my mind
  honestly the most important nietzsche books    thus spoke zarathustra  beyond good and evil  the antichrist
  a book is evil  using the word evil ever  hello npc13582
  dios mío me descojono
  it will turn you into a fucking nazi  being that affected by a book    do you become chinese when you eat sweet and sour chicken you fucking pleb
  im so unique in my online anonymous pseud sympathy towards hitler
  i am unique tho i am the founder of the church of hitler its main goal is combatting kikes and npcs like you   sympathy towards hitler  hitler was a god and everyone should love him like one
  it makes me feel a little chinky
  didnt this dude write a story about the life of a cat 3
  i know who your picture is trying to make look bad but im still going to have to view the other guy as the fucking retard on account of his shirt

  the bible anytime
    the bible is actually a good answer to op   most people will try and read it in light of the dominant ideology scientism materialism historical criticism etc in which case it is an insane compilation of ancient ramblings
  i take that back somewhat reading the bible in reference to historical criticism or modern biblical scholarship is actually very helpful but most people who attempt to read it alone without theological analysis as in a bible study or without additional reading from modern scholarship as in a university course will get very close to nothing from the text some parts possess enough literary brilliance to work on their own depending on your reading skills song of songs or ecclesiastes for ex
  im reading it atm it really hits to close to home cant almost find myself to keep on reading at times especially now with his hand on the students thigh
  it will turn you into a fucking nazi    mein kampf is so atrociously written it could turn a nazi into a pacifist social democrat
  thus spoke zarathustra  sure its an amazing read  beyond good and evil  yes i agree  the antichrist  its just ramblings of a sick man even nietzsche himself later disavowed this book  you should never take it seriously
  angry at the world  sheep cope
  interesting viewpoint how are song of songs and ecclesiastes misinterpreted they seem like some of the most direct parts in the book
  the foundation for exploration
  read the (((annotations and commentary))) so you can keep in perspective how evil it is and remind yourself that youre only reading it for historical reasons
  read the post again i think you misunderstood
  read it dont see why there are people who hold this overly opinionated piece of shit with any esteem its a faggot ranting a lot    i guess it could turn you into a nazi if youre an angry backwoods hillbilly autistic schizophrenic or just really angry and love to rant about everyone in general
  the classic answer to this question is that young men shouldnt read 水浒传 water margin and old men shouldnt read 三国演义 romance of the three kingdoms

not the best book to read when youre already depressed youve been warned
  this is the best book you can read if you dont want to get out of depression
  i read it without annotations in its original german fraktur and i thought it was a fucking joke its incredibly shallow based on pseudoscience unproven claims wishful thinking and fallacious arguments the highlighted parts were particularly funny i guess he tried to summarize important points in his auditory style but it just seems silly on paper
  wtf is this
  very wrong you can pick the parts you like and not be influenced by a unified reading by a scholar with dubious intentions its far better to feel it yourself than submit to correct readings by untrustworthy authority structures
  tfw had to read that for high school  was already a depressive downer then
  eh thanks for your input
  its incredibly shallow based on pseudoscience unproven claims wishful thinking and fallacious arguments  its trumps favorite book isnt it
  if youre referring to the bedside hitler he kept according to some exwife that was a collection of speeches i believe
  chaotic neutral personified
  the constant daily threads here are enough to make me depressed
  as the only one responding to this post who can tell that it was bait id like to offer a fun anecdote one of the early reviewers of mein kampf said it ought to have been titled mein krampf my cramp because the writing was so bad
  m e g a c r i n g e
  i read it without annotations in its original german fraktur and i thought it was a fucking joke  sure you did  bucko
persuasion and rhetoric by carlo michelstaedter one of the best and most beautiful philosophy book ive read yet if read at the wrong time in your life youll end up putting a bullet in your head like the author did after finishing writing it     it is amazing though you do need some background in philosophy though some in the presocratic philosophers would make it a more worthwhile read translation available out there is not so great though
    most people will try and read it in light of the dominant ideology scientism materialism historical criticism etc  no christcuck most people who read the bible are interested in drinking the blood of the mangod missionaries hand them out by the millions

  whoops should have proofread before posting  es fehlt ihnen jene große magnetische anziehung der die breite masse immer nur folgt unter dem zwingenden eindruck großer überragender gesichtspunkte der überzeugungskraft bedingungslosen glaubens an dieselben gepaart mit dem fanatischen kampfesmut für sie einzustehen
    how can one person be so wrong  kill yourself academic kike  read our hot talmudic opinion pieces on christian literature that has been explained a thousand times over by church doctors and theologians
  what would you suggest reading before reading this
  i mean i could go with the meme of start with the greeks and in this case it would be a very good advice id say you need at a minimum to know a bit of what plato and aristotles philosophies are about and since he continuously quotes the presocratics such as parmenides it would be worthwhile to know some of it but its not needed to understand his book per say    also it is a hard read in many ways not as difficult as say heidegger but you need to be able to read and understand such a language anyways just dive in and see what you make out of it its worth it

  a man sensei living the rest of his life in shame and penitence for having selfishly betrayed his only friend and in turn becoming the exact thing that he had vowed never to become  the realisation that man is fated to be driven by ruthless selfprofit utterly annihilates him     my horrible synopsis doesnt do it justice
lol at jidf replies on the first post

  the empirical scientific method is the only valid way of looking at the world  whats an epepisteme science is the only real i need  turns on tv  our whole universe was in a hot dense state    hello npc13583
  dont resist anon flee civilization and go live in the woods    the future begins with you
  even nietzsche himself later disavowed this book  do you have a single fact to back that up
no longer human  osamu dazai
  otger anon i thought it was pretty accessible but if you want to read some people that are referenced  schopenhauer nietzsche leopardi presocratics ibsen greek tragedians and listen to beethoven  also he will rail against plato aristotle and hegel
    later disavowed the book    dont think he can considering he went insane soon after
  art of war
  what did he see
  this  i spent my youth trying to hate women when i should have been loving them and now im spending my adulthood trying to love women when i should be hating them
  havent read this one does chuck throw absurdiststoic insights like the movie does aside from the plot gimmicks i cant see why a young cant benefit from the whole if you want greatness if you want change and movement you have to embrace pain you have to sacrifice things message
  the movie is better than the book to be honest the ending specifically is really meh
  literally an insane man trying to describe an imaginary game he plays in his head on paper
    sounds like a comfy little book is it long i have other stuff to read but id be down for some cat comfiness
  ddude you cant just read mein kampf maoe little red book or kaczynskis manifesto what if youre influenced by the thought behind failed ideologies  then youre a moron anyways mein kampf is a fucking kino /his/ read the first part of book where he details young austrians like himself becoming attracted to pan german nationalism to spite the habsburg monarchy  the details he gives into his time as a homeless liberal arts student in vienna  the death of his parents its a fucking good read dude
    the complete and utter hopelessness disaffection and mistrust expressed and the willingness of the character to simply forfeit and withdraw are not something id want a lot of people to be influenced by if i read this as a teenager im not sure id be able to live or talk to people
  you can tell none of them actually read it  too its one of the best selling books of all time for a reason i didnt know how to buy a copy of mein kampf anywhere near where i live so i just lurked /pol/ until someone posted a pdf of the ford translation of mein kampf     hitlers prose is like 6/10 desu but then when im reading a book on that level im not looking at his prose anyways
  i had to stop reading that shit it was getting too unbearable
  unbearable explain
  this but also genealogy of morals the break down of the word good as well as well as how conscience develops really undermines your faith in morality although his arguments do fall apart when looking at morality under a pragmatic framework
  this entire book is just some pseud faggot huffing his own farts in little aphorisms because writing a coherent book takes talent about how deep and abstract he is  if you identify with the kind of person who writes entire books of pretentious cringe like  the cause of my profound sense of incompatibility with others is i believe that most people think with their feelings whereas i feel with my thoughts   then there is a reason you are depressed
  adaptación  what a pussy
  projecting pseud projects   makes sense pessoa was an extremely introverted person as he just described himself loneliness is not depression and inability to relate with other people as a result of inherent personality traits is not depression either the book of disquiet is not the book of depression you absolute pleb
  i made no statement that pessoa was depressed or the book of disquiet is about depression you illiterate cockmongler   what i claimed was that the book is 500 pages of journal entries about what a soulful little special snowflake pessoa is and that writing that or identifying with it makes you a giant faggot which is the truth
  you said  if you identify with the kind of person who writes entire books of pretentious cringe like  the cause of my profound sense of incompatibility with others is i believe that most people think with their feelings whereas i feel with my thoughts   then there is a reason you are depressed    you illiterate moron yes that implies that you think pessoa is some moody depressed teenage faggot like you the amount of projection here like goddamn
  ppprojecting  sorry im hurting your feelings there buddy  go read some more aphorisms about you have no friends because youre just too deep and complex for everyone youll feel better
      pessoa  soares
  about you have no friends because youre just too deep and complex for everyone  too much of a brainlet to understand what pessoa means when he says he expresses himself through thought and not emotional expression   hes calling himself introverted not superior you absolute seething projecting brainlet    topkek ive never seen someone get mad at pessoa for being so moody and introverted between his inconsistent heteronym in his magnum opus the point of expressing himself through a semi aphoristic and structureless auto biography was to introduce people to his chaotic and introverted lifestyle
  hunned percent fincher loved taking c books and turning them into a movies

  the only real answer is any religious text that is imposed upon impressionable children without the brainwashing of children there would be no religion on this world
  arktos always makes the worst covers check out their indoeuropean title by de benoist im interested in the topic but the cover alone makes me want to put a paper bag cover over it
  if we just banned learning anything that contradicts my beliefs at a young age people would think like me  still no
  okay now this is euphoric
  most christians dont even read the bible    obviously you cant just ban religious education but its still pretty obvious that organised religion would have much less power if it relied on converting people who can actually think for themselves  too many people only practice religion by force of habit which is too bad
most radical political treatise from marx to hitler

  90 of athiests i know are only athiests because they saw a video on youtube once and their family didnt bother to raise them at all so they just never cared about anything besides video games  their careers and etc other consumercuck activities     deracinated idiots if those same people became religious by habit it doesnt matter in every generation there is a permenant class of ignorant people who never bother to question themselves
  you are just as bad as youtube atheists who assume all religious people became religious because of ignorance and lack of intellect
  are those permanently ignorant people npcs would you say
  yes  hes pretty chill for a lolcow though hes not a bad person just a real weirdo  hes incredibly afraid of mirrors grass and other mundane stuff and he used to only eat cheese pizza although i think he got over that eventually
  buy this book before liberals ban it  jesus christ
  lovely designs
  i tried to read it but it was just so shit it was just a bunch of antisjw talking points that everyone has heard two years ago in the stylistic quality of a high school essay
  maybe it will open some kids eyes but for me it was just pure realism and that didnt make me any more sad it was beautiful
  agreed they make me want to rad the pamphlet even though i know itll probably just be dumb fundie shit
    you made me want to read that book thank you
  most athiests are agnostic athiest most agnostic athiests are so because they dont care for the question of religion one way or another       no just because someone is simple minded does not mean they are incapable of sentience
  i deleted my comment because i had typo but here it is   d like to add that its just so well articulated feelings of reality that thats how its so touching no mask just flow from man who knows about philosophics and can think about reality real open minded and doesnt larp anything  pardon my argumentation skills as i am esl speakear and cant form beautiful sentences but thats what i think about it
  people who dont care just say they believe in god and dont follow religion that way they dont have to worry too much about the afterlife or the lack thereof
      why do so many publishers insist on having cover art even if it sucks its one thing for that kind of cover to be on a shitty fantasyromance novel you see in cvs but why on classic or philosophical books nobody is going to read those based on the cover printing them with just the title on a blank cover like older books would be significantly more aesthetically pleasing
  are you familiar at all with arktos what makes you think they would have anything but shit taste
  but wouldnt a blank cover be cheaper thats what confuses me even from a business standpoint its terrible i would rather not buy a book that ugly and try and find a better copy
  they probably think it looks cool
  this is fucking hilarious what the fuck
  disliking patrician books like american psycho and fight club based on fandoms  top pseud
  those books are someones life
  cringe id be embarassed
  dude keeno  its fuckin sick bro  based gen z protector of the anglosaxon nordic heritage
    god how did that book ever get published what a pile of trash
  even a shit cover is better than no cover the only books that get away with blank covers are classics and most of the pulp genre books have absolutely awful covers and they still sell casual readers dont give a fuck
no longer human almost made me off myself
  the only books that get away with blank covers are classics  classics and philosophy books yes  casual readers dont give a fuck  exactly so why give shitty covers to classics and philosophy books

  my problems with women are fruit of my own incompetence and to despise someone or their work due to their successes in such pursuits would only serve to further impoverish my life    although reading about the protagonist getting with women might remind me once again of my own failures on such a fundamental aspect of masculine experience unleashing a fllod of doubts not only about my selfworth as a male but as a human being in general    is it at least a good book or would i be better off reading something else
  i love knowing that 99 of the young rightwingers who love to bash da liberals probably ate this shit up and believed it in its entirety they probably watch ben shapiro epic liberal destroyed in logical debate videos and suck dennis pragers nasty jewish cock

ive been working on a fantasy novel for some time now i feel like i have good worldbuilding character development a compelling plot and have avoided common tropes for the most part my goal is to get it published some day so to increase my chances ive been trying to study the market as much as possible and would greatly appreciate your input     what are the things you want your fantasy novels to have/not have tropes themes situations etc what makes you purchase one over the countless others basically if you could place a custom order for a fantasy novel from your favorite author what would be on your list

does anyone have a chart for rousseau   where should i start
  needs more classics
  may someone knowledgeable compare these two charts which is better
  this
      those are fucking garbage charts dude youre wasting your time following them and going through their bullshit orders with redundant materials or insufficient background     if all you have is a shaky high school background start with a hard precalculus textbook with khan academy training wheels get a proofs book and do apostol or spivak that should be a good start
  like for fucks sake that first chart is nothing but faggy starts tastes primers beginnings etc until you actually start doing math how about just fucking get to the point     and the second chart imagine doing set theory three times because those proof books all go into it  real analysis  precalculus  calculuslevel math  set theory again before finally doing apostol or spivak proofbased calculus that isnt at the level of real analysis    both charts are so fucking memey and retarded that i feel bad for anything who fell for them
  for the second chart you dont actually do it three times hammacks book just has one short chapter about it and its not even real theory just basically stating what sets are the other proof book is optional so you really only do the theory once in enderton next as the name suggests you develop the theory of the sets of numbers and basic operations on these it makes no sense reading basic mathematics before actually having a proper grasp of what numbers are in a modern context hell in the very preface to the foundations of analysis the author even states that no prerequisite knowledge whatsoever is required
  that yellow serge lang  whoever made ops chart fucks that guy fucks  for sure
im convinced following any of these charts in sequence is asinine and a good way to hate literature
dumping
  though i didnt use it the newer swtg chart is great the one with the grey background

    too bardic and antiquated in tone and diction to be enjoyable as a contemporary work you know how to construct a fluid sentence and thats good but the subject matter and overall language are abrasively archaic to a genuinely impenetrable point you are not a bad writer by any means dont think that at all however youve no sense of sincerity spontaneity or any of the necessary qualities to be an enticing poet in this work im not saying it or you are hopeless but you must think more of the 21st century and not the 19th when youre writing otherwise it is utterly pointless to share with anyone but yourself update the language aesthetics and tone then you will hopefully be able to write a good poem good luck
  theres no coherent rhythm or musicality you occasionally have a series of lines that work but the majority of the poem is a garbled mess i would suggest reading your work out loud as youre composing it

    clean and somberly poignant i like it reminds me of rilke weirdly though i cant help but feel that it isnt totally sincere something about the poems essence feels contrived as if its trying to put on that germanic solemnity as much as i enjoy the poem it does not feel so much like an individual wrote it but one who knows how to adequately imitate what hes read take what you may of this of course it doesnt have to ring true but at least consider the fact that although it is good it doesnt stand out

first experiment in prose poetry would appreciate feedback        and then there was nothing not a cruel wandering of mine that wasnt fastened by your brown rippled locks tangled in your creamy lecherous skin a calm vase you were wine red and dark as the taste of meat i lowered myself over you i lowered my lips my greasy hair my light i was light then so light my skin was a valve just as yours was only letting our soul free when we felt one anothers warmth then we wandered freely in each other as in a dream waking back in our own body each morning on your undone sheets i had known the taste of meat the taste of wine the deep red skies of dawn were smeared over us awakening weakening the night leaving this frozen earth we woke and ripped pieces of ourselves and fed them to one another like pieces of bread drinking extra pulp orange juice drinking also the paling orange dawn the swaying ochre gasses of the lamppost hung near the window we held our tepid bodies close defeaning the pulplessness of the world for long instants i could not breathe the pulp of your heart beat hard against my chin long gusts of you entered my lungs i held them in until my mind went numb and we left that room again i was dizzy with the indelible snowy smell of your tongue i was gouged out of my body by the air your pristine presence left i was preyed upon by a crow who knew me dead already i had known just then that i would never be whole without your winecoated love    and thus not an instant did i not believe every inch of me belonged to you my green blue eyes my veins were ropes my skin was sailcloth you sailed me into the whales mouth the deep red and pink opening of the night free of anything anything anything you were you breathed that was all i ever was and needed ah and much later when our kisses turned to wasps that was also true when we put our clothes back on and turned toward the day that was also true when your wine turned back into blood that was also true when all i said and believed of my love for you dispersed and the snow dried over the snowbroken grass that was also true when the black and blue crow came and plucked out of my navel the clammy moist unending worm you had stuffed there that was also true but when the windows of my soul shook for the last time and howled like seagulls silvery as your almond eyes soutaned in mascara i heard the alamandas blooming so yellow and lax billowing bushes as far as the eye can see and you were not among them
 is me i will do some critiques quickly    fun but mind the clogged rhythms and i dont feel as if the substance comes through very well at least i could not figure out an immediate meaning      i also liked this im not sure the end of the poem does it justice it feels powerful but not quite exactly what would tie the knot i think its the shivers for me the intrusion of the speaker makes this a bit too disparate and left me unsure of what the final sentiment you intended is
  a man has told me god is good  and stands above all men  that he will never cast us forth  though drenched with lust and sin  that though we heed him little  and pursue our own accord  he will not seek our bane nor yet  unsheath his deadly sword  that he forgives excesses  and will not our prayers reject    there was rumor in gomorrah  to that very same effect    a friend avers that government  has all our cares in mind  and will not neglect the comfort of  the poor the halt the blind  he maintains unreservedly  his faith in policy  to bring the fruits of honor to  the strong the just the free  he says the great in power seek  the profit of all men    it was mentioned in treblinka  but i did not heed it then    technology will save us  i have heard a stranger say  the wonderment of science  skill and tools will win the day  our comfort and our safety  we may leave to wise devices  and men who build and train them up  will coddle all our vices  theyll see the future clearly  and avert all waiting dooms    i think i heard it spoken in  the titanics smoking rooms    the forgiveness of the strong is great  im sure most men agree  the wisest and the best of us  will surely all be free  the bold men wise in letters  with their eye on public weal  will never be cast out or forced  their knowledge to conceal  time alters soon the hearts of kings  and all will be put right    i heard it in the gulag  almost every single night    so go forth with the banner  of redemption wafting high  and shout the slogan liberty  in land and sea and sky  of justice peace forgiveness love  proclaim the coming reign  and cry the truth to power  and the vanity of gain  that mercy always triumphs  and that men will all be free    go tell them in gomorrah  but you didnt come from me
    not terrible but more or less unreadable the hasty brooding music you have going on is interesting but not enough to carry how poor the language is theres nothing wrong with being pretentious in your art but if youre going to be you may as well have enough talent to supplement it and make it tolerable if not an enhancer to the piece but this does no such thing its verbose and undesirably bleak without much redemption i suggest taking yourself a little less seriously and learning to develop an interesting language before getting all dark and moody or whatever in your writing humble your voice until youve learned enough to take it further as of now youre very far from what this wants to be
    the content is boring and contrived and that debases the poem before one can even attempt to appreciate it do not try to be deep in your poetry especially not as a twentysomething on lit of all boards just write write something pretty or sad or surreal or something but do not capsize yourself by trying to be profound in any right youre only hindering yourself     aside from that the diction is anachronistic and frankly flat everything about this needs to be left in whatever century its meant to imitate you need to go back to the drawing board and think of something that is relevant to our zeitgeist and not embarrassingly affected
  our zeitgeist    really anon really theoretically in the internet age any mention of a closely monitored and moderated societal narative should be laughed at and dismissed esoecially on this board of all places to say just write is the most moronic statement how else did the other anon produce the poem    wait this is bait isnt it      on the third sunday  i took a sliver from my thumb  while cutting vegetables for lunch    it rested on the table  beside a chunk of carrot  and i thought for a moment i should  throw it in the pot
lets do a riff then   when she came dashing in the door  i kept my steady gaze it ended there   fate had won and mona lisa smiled  no laughs this sweet day amor vida de mi vida untouched by sun or night it is i dear to march us astray     you havent kissed the lightest wisp of heather hair from darkened lips  a lovers only watched and heard   your toes slip down i aim to miss  your shining eyes each damned day apart    oh no oh no what can i do  to keep myself from scarring you   i cant go back its that i fear  the world that moves without my bliss im selfish youre perfect  you must stay right here     this one its her who laughed at no  other boys jokes dropped pens for  them to pick up hemmed a dress for prom so to pretend to not have fun a wonder bred for games and songs    be cruel come back another day   your eyes belie wisdom forget   your fingers are sure be less  i only wish to hear speak slow ill listen your tongue revealing ancient texts     now you have your book oh no  you laugh oh no   i smile oh no   the blood in the middle of your lip  how could i resist

first place    id write you a poem  about the madness of our times  but instead ill drink some   chrysanthenum tea  and remember the fact that   trombes theme  replaces boss battle themes  in most of the super robot series  and that in itself might be   a relief to you reading this    see its fucking easy   never say that poetrys  difficult challenging   or impossible  just get used to spacing  maybe find someone  fall in love  i dont know ffs    if i knew the path to wisdom  why would i be writing poetry   pray for safe journeys  world  universe  step
  you aight white boy
    youre over complicating it to say our zeitgest in this context especially when the entirety of the crit was based on the poem sounding archaic and contrived simply means to be more contemporary its not a matter of pinpointing the total human experience of our time but being relevant to at least one in both form and sentiment just write is should not have been so hard to figure out anon again the entire poem was so blatantly puton im just asking him to write without be so terribly affected with whatever bardic essence hes masquerading
    this is really bad i get that its meant to be colloquial and i suppose contrarian but it does so in a very uninspired way youre mocking poetry but arent showing that you have any grounds to do so its fine if you want to make fun of things and be experimental but dont do that before you actually learn how to write properly otherwise it just comes off as lazy and pretentious never say that poetrys difficult challenging or impossible yeah its not when you dont have any consideration for refining your craft as youve so gauchely displayed here     its good that you want to think outside the box and innovate though keep that energy when you learn to write and become a decent poet itll do you very well keep trying

im trying to write a sonnet a day here is my second one from yesterday ill give any critiques that i think might be helpful in the next post
  well i have already improved the third line heres my first sonnet
  i like this one alot
god   god i wanna fuck my wife again   if i could show the young me who he would eventually end up with   hed pump his fist   as i do   as always makes her laugh   in the air   and it would make him happy  and hopeful as i never was  oh well hell end up here  when i am dead
      i imagine this is all the same dude    what is the point of giving criticism if you just systematically destruct anything and everything the piece has to give you should single out what is done well and what is not how you would proceed instead and always keep in mind this is meant as a way for us to better one another as writers theres no use trying to fit every poem in your views of what is proper poetry easily dismissing everything but your own a good reader takes part in the universe of the writer we are all amateurs you dont need to be so abrasive to get your point across    i wonder if you do these criticism out of a care for others work or as an ego trip bringing others down to nurture your own sense of intellectual superiority in any case this type of criticism is just unproductive
  i would remove the dear its a bit a cumbersome and it doesnt tell us anything that might not just as well be left in silence or have i missed something    i really like it even the other one which i dont like makes me want to read more do you like hart crane
    yeah its all me and no i dont do it to feel superior its just the language of crit ive been conditioned with and ive found most useful for myself i personally think it helps to have your ego checked as thoroughly as possible as far as being a poet goes and in my opinion / experience harshness is the quickest way to do so im not even a good writer myself but ive been most helped by rigidness in feedback and figure others can benefit from it as well i agree with you that there are other means of crit that can be effective but this is just what i prefer and have grown to find appropriate a crit is a crit theres no use in trying to micromanage it every piece of it should be thought about and either dismissed or considered and im saying this as someone whose been terribly offended by the responses ive gotten on here ive no desire to see any writer squander their potential if i did i would say stop writing i just want everyone to grow and hone their craft to their best ability
      ok ill admit i look stupid as fuck for that you got me on being illiterate and belligerent
i miss the frequent sips of wine  upon rock beach bathed by moon divine  cool glass of water by my coffee  and the cobblestone streets where i felt so free   cigarettes between lips then timed my stay  well see it again some other day
  this is unioronically really catchy teebeehaych
  what this anon said    also a few things to note which apply to you but also apply to everyone itt i see some common issues in these threads    it is almost always awkward for a series of nouns and adjectives to stand alone without some action most good and classic poetry uses verbs to create images   images are the cornerstone of poetry and you should paint them succinctly and they should clearly support your thesis   you should have a thesis a feeling a picture a theme or whatever it is that convicts you to write you should identify that thing and make sure your poem communicates it  it is important to say what you really mean youll get good results from understanding your feelings if you know what you want to say then you will say it  there are many archaic sounding poems in these threads and while they sound nice they feel disingenuous and derivative nobody speaks like milton anymore and there is a good chance that most contemporary feelings and experiences of life do not merit that epic tone this is to say that you should know your influences and recognize their presence in your work as another way of finding out what you really want to say
  ive had rude professors and ive never seen in any writing workshop this much unilaterally rude criticism litterally all you say is this is not how i like poetry done this is bad learn how to write    ask yourself where does the critiqued writer go from here what does he work on improving himself and his piece in the immediate and how should he go about it if your goal is simply to egocheck the writer then thats not criticism some people come here simply to have a second opinion on their piece and polish the rougher edges of it    something being done in a kitsch style being overdone etc should not deter you from appreciating it writers imitate often imitate what they read even the best of them accept someone might be working in a mode or tone or diction that feels off and critique within that intention in what they did right and wrong dont critique how that specific form is not esthetic in accordance to your principles of good writing it serves no purpose
    thanks for the comment just to say that a critic should always be constructive with their criticism  theres already too much dark energy in the world     youre mocking poetry    honestly didnt think so when writing it i had just read some beat poetry     but honestly thanks for the help  i found it exciting to write something in 30 seconds that other people could mull over and comment on     keep on shitposting /lit/
  
  try a revision and this time use as few adjectives as you possibly can while still communicating your story not every noun needs an adjective and not every verb needs an adverb
    also i wanna add that you really do have some great expressions here  and thus not an instant did i not believe every inch of me belonged to you my green blue eyes my veins were ropes my skin was sailcloth you sailed me into the whales mouth the deep red and pink opening of the night free of anything anything anything you were you breathed that was all i ever was and needed  this bit is really excellent to me but then the rest of the paragraph carries on with a similar pace i understand you want to make it sort streamofconsciousness but a few intermissions can help the reader relax and digest your feelings properly
    thats fair and ill keep in mind what you say about allowing people the room to imitate especially considering i did the same for most of my earlier writing i guess i focus on it a lot because it doesnt seem like theres any consciousness of it being done in the case of myself id recognized i was archaic and wanted to improve that after it was called out a few times so i basically just hope people here can have a similar reaction i do think its fair to critique how a form isnt in accordance with my preference however because im the reader im not ever trying to imply that my ruling is definitive but that it is simply the impression their work had on me the tone is supercilious because im a prick but that doesnt mean the poet needs to subscribe to its conviction and i doubt anyone is anyway one thing ive learned from posting on here is that one person will say trash and another will say brilliant in a matter of seconds its all a matter of preference and under that knowledge i think its fine to make whichever judgement one pleases so if i say this needs to be made fresher more relevant to our time its just as valid as someone saying i love this i really appreciate the 19th century romantic vibe but aside from that youre right in that i need to be more scrupulous in my critiques and give people a bit more to work with ill try to do that more often i do frequently try to make a point even when its something id deem anachronistic that the poet does know how to construct sentences fluidly and hes not without potential iirc i said that to a couple people in this thread its never about solely putting people down just that i happen to be finding more bad than good in what im reading here so thats what i talk about i appreciate your opinion on the whole matter though
    mentioning beat poetry gives that poem more context for me i see well the brevity is evident and thats not to your benefit considering how cheeky it is id be interested in reading something youve put more effort into
    i think youve done a very good job there are a few points where your meter is not totally correct but for a days work its good just be careful not to sink too deeply into outdated language
    i agree with everything you mentioned in that second paragraph but im op and wondering where you felt that the poem didnt adhere to what youre describing a lot of the nouns do have verbs and the ones that dont are meant to be symbolic whether or not thats working im interested in finding out    peppermints leaves study     winks of honey drool     twilight beams stamp     each note deflates     etc etc all caps was for emphasis sorry if it comes off as aggressive    in regards to the music of it idk i feel that its clunky in some spaces but for the most part i felt that i paid attention to rhythm decently enough if youd care to exemplify where it falls short it would be much appreciated thank you in any event
still tweaking this but whatever im trying to write actual poetry instead of writing trash venting about how sad i am and how i miss my crush etc        i float comfortably  wrapped snug in the loops of the ivy  against the stationblock cool  i see nothing but its brilliant red  burning in all possibility  where now
    i like this its soft but not in a corny way or anything its genuine the ending doesnt help at all it disrupts the language prior to it and just isnt very evocative of anything interesting id settle down with the abstractions too comfortably snug you can reveal these qualities through images alone you dont need to literally say thats how they make you feel how are you floating that shows the reader its with comfort describe that you could even say swaddled in loops of ivy if you want to imply snugness without being so blatant there are many choices here i see nothing but its brilliant red burning in all possibility is a lovely line also pay closer attention to the music of the poem lets say you are going to go with swaddled youd wanna say swaddled in loops of ivy not in the of the i mean to say the ivy does create fun dramatic effect but at the expense of clunking up the line so use things like that at your own risk keep trying to write actual poetry youre not bad
  yeah actually reading your poem i dont see many of those flaws the line breaks were obscuring the sentences so i thought that some of them were just fragments and statements without action the poem actually reads quite nicely when i take it slowly but nonetheless there seems to be some stiffness that i cant really put my finger on also in my opinion using a lowercase i manufacturers acquaintance that otherwise is not really present and i think you would do better to try and imply that quaintness through the words of your poem and not the capitalization i think the way you established the structure of three line stanzas and its kind of a meter was really nice and that you broke it later on in the phone really made it stand out maybe if you try and reinforce that structure then breaking it will be a little bit more impactful and maybe the phone will feel less stiff to me i dont really know these are just my feelings about the poem
    imho contexually  its missing something lyrically  i can barely see  what the point is literally  forget the symmetry  no point in making tracks eurythmiclly    its not great and yet  still no great catastrophe  listen to some hiphop/ wu tang   and then anon get back to me   now sincere apologies  stop talking in apostrophes  hurly burly done get the indices  now for the drudgery      for the lyrics you seize  dont do as you please purveyor of cheese  dare to enter olive garden  back to your crackers and brie faker of chi
you bring colour to my life  when the worlds got nothing but greys  youre my rock in the ocean  i want to pound you like the waves    they can keep their fancy costumes  they can keep their glowing neon  when i look into your eyes  i know im right where i belong    when the storm is blowing strong  ill hold on to you  when my heart is dead and hope is gone  ill keep on going for you    they may say our dreams arent real  they may say dreams are a bunch of lies  but theres one thing i know  when i look you in the eyes    they may say our dreams dont matter  but i know thats not true  because ive found my dream  and i know that its you    when the storm is blowing strong  ill hold on to you  when my heart is dead and hope is gone  ill keep on going for you
  a quaintness not aquaintance
    get this guy a record deal change the language a bit and this is pure radio fuel    i want to pound you like the waves    honestly reading this my sides have reached the stratosphere
  if you think it doesnt tell you anything then i would be very happy to remove it i just wasnt sure if the nature of the address is clear without it how come the second one makes you want to read more even though you dont like it and of course i love hart crane i didnt have him in mind while writing this though im more interested in the symbolists and decadents at the moment though of course these were important influences on crane        thanks i guess maybe i should force myself to do a perfectly regular pentameter but i also like foot inversions and that kind of thing what about the content though granted i let the rhymes do much of the talking for me but i also went in with some idea of what i wanted to say
  but what about the content though   honestly i am having difficulty figuring out what either sonnet is about this could be my fault i dont know but especially in the first sonnet you posted i see a few open quote marks that never get closed is this some kind of device
i walked down the street with my guardian angel  we ate pizza and talked about the music wed make  we got lost and found and watched a band
  i adopted the old convention of beginning every stanza by the same speaker with an open quotation mark to serve as a reminder that it is a dramatic monologue
  well take my opinions with a big grain of salt then it seems like you know more about sonnets than i do
there is a streetlamp it is  an orange streetlamp  she is casting shadows of peach blossoms  on my wall    i pour coffee that my father made  he ground the beans  he put the grounds   in the filter  and i am sitting where a morning sun  drags across the couch    three pm air smells like wet lavender  we are hanging christmas lights    i put my head deep in a pillow and  roll to one side the north side  and recall the breadth of me  hand to hand wide and tall  and i think the wind  is creeping in my window    i see shadows of branches   on my wall
  im not who you replied to but i agree with him all your points of criticism may be valid but its useless if you just leave the writer directionless and depressed to enumerate your points try occasionally picking an example from the work and specify how you would change it the combination of knowing what to change and how to change it will allow the writer to understand your critique and will improve his work
jamestown    a burning itch rises from the deep  rouses my hunger from its complacent sleep  cast on shores foreign and absurd  in the bowels of our ship a scream is heard  we embark upon this travel bearing our heap  our lust and yearning  tongues unspoken word    savage infinity cannot quell the flame  a hawklike eye discerns the same  the memory of our old rushes headlong into new  diving screeching terror scourge from yonder blue  firm hands are needed nature resists its tame  we unremitting predators shall shackle her too    construct by day convene by fire at night  pagan plans conjured in the bask of flames light  faces wore thinly like the living in graves  there is no freedom no reprieve which saves  such is our burden our masks of great fright  these are the talismans to ward off the waves    soon we must feed appease that gaping maw  manly virtue thwarted under winters hoary thaw  their cheeks grow weary and embalm the face  rise ye sinners leave ye this place  whither shall we run we enemies of all law  who know not the hearths warmth its loving embrace    heathen temples mark our initial conquest  the pains of fate give us no soothing rest  farther up the road we shall soon encamp  gone is the frost instead we feel damp  one way forward that way is west  where natures howling winds extinguish lifes lamp    nothing whispers nature nothing for thy taking  mine is a hollow chamber filled with violent shaking  the native dance turns wild casts shadows on the heart  but ours is a destiny we cannot depart  warn us no more for that hunger is awaking  i beseech thee death to give life its start    albions summer distances itself still  a dim recollection to abate my will  now the seeds are sewn for our earthly gain  let us leave off nostalgia to wax and wane  i shall avenge dead memories i shall plunder destroy and kill  we enslave implacable nature yoke it neath this pain    like wildfire it spreads this lunatic vision  moonlit fancies ebb into derision  this new world is vast  vast beyond measure  all the more reason to rack from it pleasure  energetic frenzy compels us to collision  with ageold bounty and untold treasure    so hark noble fellows take from nature more  thy hands fit for grasping that superfluous whore  wring from her bosom every ounce and drop  til those shadows come around her screaming shant stop  brandish new weapons newer honors for war  rollest thou ever onward to the hardfought top    pic is of columbus but it still works for the poem
    quite pleasant i enjoyed reading it only thing id say is to mind the rhythm a bit more she is casting shadows of peach blossoms feels clunky to me theres gotta be a way to truncate that and keep its sentiment although the poem is nice and clean id say it only barely gets away with its lack of ambition the sounds are nice the images are soft but it needs more life to it as a whole keep it up
  i agree your earnestness in conveying senseimpressions cannot be questioned but there has to be some kind of import to your poem this is not crystalline enough to be imagism
    thank you for the feedback im really leaning into imagism and writing what i know i write about the things i think are beautiful i wanted this poem to feel exactly how i feel and to instill some peace in the reader but a thesis or a point is probably necessary to carry the whole thing

  nah stopped taking you seriously at the second line secrets veil and love is too much abstraction for one line
  the tone is arrogant there is no explanation of the againstness except a naming of who youre against there is no argument whatever only puns derived from key ideas/names associated with whom youre supposedly against    an arrogant tone is fine but i expect it be backed up with brilliant rebuttals not derivative and superficial punnery penetrable in a google search
  i want to pound you like the waves
  intention was to make it sound like it was written by a pseud who buys into conspiracy theories and what not but yeah i suppose i should tone down the arrogance  new to this so thanks for the criticism
    oh theres plenty wrong with that poem i suspect youre more able a critic than your reply suggests try again earn your hatred
  i dont understand why anyone would attempt to write a poem whose major axis is the hidden stupidity of its own voice i dont believe you i think you are a pseud attempting to sound academic
  its a terrible pun waves pound they are not pounded
  i understand you thinking that probably not the best idea for a poem but do you think there would be a way to draw out what i was going for so people dont get the same impression you did i thought the allusions to flat earthers and climate change denial were enough but maybe not
  gosh now youre really knotting my head up
blessed mark the embereyes of local faces  we meet them by the mill  clipping grass under their naked toes  jokes remind of nights like these  the varied carols of crickets and paws  newspapers whistle spirals against the pants of passing folk  windows riddled with thick smoke run above storefronts and dim colors  chattering figures in the margins fast talk  sightings of wolves  husks of goodbyes  the hallway we entered leaves us now  licked by blue lights tickle the dark corners with shapes of floating yarnbits  young men trade their suppersongs across a stained counter  i hear an old mother thinking against the noise  favor our brood oh father one  our tender stocks and little bundleseeds  every prayer the same  stay the feral tooth of night  huddle close the sweetness of posterity  friendly whispers mimic the bustle of a growing brier  i rouse my eyes and gaze the silver moon  it shuts them closed
  this seems like a list of more or less sequential observations in an insubstantial place you could improve it a lot by chopping all the is out
  try again  earn  whats your problem dude im not gonna spend even more of my time on bad art one dismissal suffices
  hey buddy stop replying to me
    not the anon who responded to you but as much as i wanna believe your claim about the poem his impression rings more true its pompous and the irony of it isnt apparent at all the language is highregister and as we dont know you as a poet we must take its expressions as more or less sincere if you want the facetiousness to come across then yes you ought to be more blatant about it what youre doing now isnt working at all
  totally understandable im very new to all this and probably wont be able to make the irony come off as clear as i want it to be i was thinking i would just get rid of the name drops and reference more conspiracy theories but now im kinda feeling like the idea isnt even that good in the first place
  it could work but i would recommend doing two things 1 lower the register of the language or maintain the high register and occasionally drop into an extremely low register for comic effect 2 expand the poem probably to at least twice the length irony needs to sink in and unless as others have pointed out you expect irony from the poet its not usually the first place the mind goes when reading a line
  i think that whatever point you mean to make here barring that i missed something could be distilled into like five lines theres a lot of stuff to sort through complicated and verbose / poetic
a lot of these are too clever for their own good a little too keen to prove their poetic worth that sort of thing though its not like im any better
  whatever point you mean to make here    i wrote this in 23 minutes there is no point at all
poetry is trash
  are you proud of giving so little a shit does producing pointless trash gratify you
    you are trash you are a feeble minded brainlet incapable of bringing himself up to the difficult task of understanding the idiomatic capacity of language no even worse you are so consumed by the glory of your own mediocre aprehension of language ie your aprehension of reality itself that you shrink in the face of the possibility of your being a peanut and deny the glory of the sun in the acidic dirt that crumbles your leaves which might otherwise sing the strange praises of a reality crystalline and essentially beyond the grasp of meaning itself but endlessly approximate to it the laudato of taller flowers with greater and lesser colors and thorns falling by the way nearby and sinking into the composted self consumption of your own obscene bloom verifying merely the fact of sun and vagination and depriving the existence of floral things blooming spectacular altogether you are worse than trash you are the heaping pettines of last summers gardens dead in the snow and called only to life by the plowing of mere men
  i give more of a shit than you and my shitting out things shows as much and i take a little pride in that yes
  i give more of a shit than you  writes 3 minute instapoetry  you dont even know how much you dont know bucko
  prove me wrong idiot make me feel tiny and shameful you wont
finished this today    complaint    why is it that whenever i talk with the duchess  my belly growls and my nose waters why must it  be my hand that tumbles her wine glass over   into the cellini salt dish    stiff as a gaffer fidgety as a child   after twenty years of struggling to be a courtier  i remain incapable of the least politeness  wit song or learning    and i wonder sometimes what is it in me that hates me  is it that rolling captain who should burst  like surf into her presence dumping down  his pillage of the seas    and in a wink dissolve her castled pride  she scorns no common magic and could be pleased  to be manhandled like a kitchengirl  so it were sweet and reckless     or is it that idolatrous fool thats in me  who lest she alter should enchant the hour  with gentled sparrows and an aimless lute  enthralling her with tales    of a kings daughter bound in mountain sleep  whose prince and wakener detained by trials  in deserts deeps and grottoes of the world  approaches her forever    or am i spited by the priest i might be  there in the stone grove of her oratory  no ship sails out so free as she at prayer  with head bowed and shrouded
    not bad alltogether though i think one could go much farther with this theme pursuing the antagonisms of masculine assertion and a timid submission before woman to a much more shocking or reconciled conclusion rather than ending on ellipses as i think youve done the last two lines mean nothing to me    to be manhandled like a kitchengirl strikes me as a weak line     i rolled my eyes at cellini but appreciated the echo in like surf into her presence dumping down / his pillage of the seas though i think its her pillage not his
safe in their alabaster chambers   untouched by morning    and untouched by noon   sleep the meek members of the resurrection   rafter of satin and roof of stone      grand go the years   in the crescent above them   worlds scoop their arcs    and firmaments  row   diadems  drop   and doges surrender   soundless as dots   on a disk of snow
hanging there in the starless night it speaks of a world known but unseen a mirror to the light of day so that the stars of man know the brevity of their days     can someone help me with this one using day twice is bugging the shit out of me
  down the road we walked  like brothers once were we  our roads diverge  never to merge  down the road we walk
  awful and effortless    rafters of satin and roofs of stone   nice  overall message its all really big  a difficult notion to put in poetry and here could certainly be expanded there is a wink of irony in likening dots on a disk of snow to planetary orbits which i like not a bad ending but ended before it got going      use a synecdoche for day sun sunlight light brightness etc
  a mirror to the light of brightness  i love it

  yes i didnt read your stupid poem i read his single green text line try writing a real poem
  thank you anon you give good feedback im not satisfied with the ending either ive changed it several times but havent found a good one yet i wish i could end it on the previous line but it sounds too abrupt that way imo
  why do you post this in the critique thread do you sincerely get pleasure out of seeing that some random doesnt recognize stevens maybe you are a pseud who got critiqued too hard and you want to discount all of /lit/ with this tactic of yours i dont fuckn know bad post faggot

i stare into widen pupils her screen  as wind blows trees denuded show their pure  demeanor hair whirling as if they were  to follow leaves displaying shades of green  i stumble on her face sight of pristine  beauty howling wind was silenced secure  and free my mind dripping into the future  that could have been if only he had been  a bit more crimson leaflets surge the air  her face dissolves bit by bit remains her hair
has anyone on /lit/ ever been published seeing how all you people write like its the eighteenth century im doubtful

    the selfawareness is a very good start maybe try a more colloquial language it might help breaking out of insincere registers is hard but once you do things become a lot more fluid besides the concept is fun the execution is all that needs touching up keep trying

  speckled skies lay feverently on a never ended coast line  a love seagull carrying a gun walks upon the limitless ridge  a plop  a gambler appears from the water  is he smiling because he is evil  we are handed money by him and a gold tooth falls from his skull  leaves promptly  not long before a serpent beckons  aiding his call a high calibur sniper bullet buries into the sand near his grin  little reason to stay  munich is a nice city
  i picture this at its best as nothing but the cheeky first stanza on a single page    every line is stark taken on its own but the whole is worth pondering over really enjoy it      you could rework on the other hand and line 8    keep coming back to it giving the metaphor primacy on the first line really leaves the reader hanging on the concept  action that follows
  any of them really i thought it was just one person at first but id like to speak to someone whos actually interested in and educated about literature and poetry for a change i mean they have to be

i got a phone call from your mother today  her lips were pursed and candied id say  i couldnt see her between the borders of states  but she told me i should let go of the blame    she called me up to build me higher than ive felt for the longest day  we spoke a while and dreamt on a nostalgic plane  she told me sweetly that her memories of her daughter  involve me too in some way  she lingered with each breath as if to sigh  before she told me she used to lie awake  rue in her wrinkles for having turned me away  from your funeral that longgone but not forgotten day    her sighs turned to shudders and her facade of being a mother  shattered like chalky kiln pressured ohio valley clay  she sobbed through hysterics and left me feeling desperate  of feeling a similar love for the ghost ill leave behind  with a note lengthened in a shakily scrawled essay    it was pure and powerful to hear the shake  in her voice as it pronounced my three syllable name  hoping she got my number right  not knowing theres a reason ive not cared to change  today i got the answer to a question i never thought to say  speaking is important to lighten how the emotions weigh  she told me i should let go of the blame    but you knew me best better than they  i cant quit the blame  but i can lie to her for her own sake  so she can move on and feel less of the dismay  no parent should ever outlive their own flesh given  the sound of her voice like a subdued painful frisson  i told her a lie to keep her spirits intact  to keep alive a promise whose corners are bent but without crack  i know youd let me out of any dotted line i signed if i wanted  free of your faustian contract  but i digress  im a mess  full of shame for how i handled you and your name  ive written and talked about you like you were an old flame  i tried moving on  but all the old noises i hear them new and all the same  your ghost has followed me because i asked and you came    i love you  i miss you  ill come play with you in space
  too many people just write stream of consciousness diary prose with a few rhymes in it then try to give it some random visual structure so it looks like a poem
  robert lowell destroyed poetry
  people doing a thing doesnt make it bad unless youre trying to cultivate a nonconforming aesthetic somehow doubt poetry is popular enough that too many people doing anything with it is bad      this is fucking awful though and seems way too awkwardly personal and needlessly introspective without saying much
chimes bid farewell as the last wind to ever end  blows its final charms through the hairs on our arms    walls with bubbled fire gleeful for escape scratch  out etches of their own cave paintings ill remember you    times hid beneath a soft surface the souls foreign purpose  to explore the alien that is land beyond here a future mere    struck dumb deaf congenital heart murmurs and other gossips  fogged out windows bottomed at the last ends of an emptied quarry    we dug the new digs and the careful resemblance to a rhyme we like to sing  along to in lieu of the high notes we contort brows and eyes high for a few    this tumult of twenties gleam in stark contrast  made heavier with temptations i forgot everything    finally tired of the past i find the future narrowing before my salted vision  too late to change course  reef ourselves then the wind has harrowed a billow the last of its kind  we are now safely where we must be were told to go were held and pointed  to by arms hairier than ours then that is your place in this world  carried across the sea in a pity as a great wind  carried us too across the sky    we act as rupture on this virginity  a land with no wind is too new  god please tell me what to do  guide me in again
  when i say too many people are doing it is bad its because that style makes bad poetry particularly when the structure has no logic at all and looks terrifying like that poem
  if you want logic then get good at math if you want strict adherence to structure then ignore anything written after the late 19th century theres more shamefully baroque poetry i see posted than streams of course if all you read are the 100 poems that get posted once a week on /lit/ you wouldnt see that
  im not talking down to unstructured poetry im talking about specific types of bad poetry where people just write a diary entry use a few descriptive words and bad rhyme then add some random structure to it so it looks like a poem when its not its banal stuff and is egocentric in the sense that it does far more for the writer than the reader because of its confessional nature
  how can a poem simultaneously be a stream of consciousness diary entry and have structure and rhyme added afterwards also you think homer donne wallace blake or yeats didnt write from an egocentric viewpoint     if down to its bare minimum art is about emotion then to write from the ego is to be the most honest anybody with a basic understanding of scheme and meter alongside time and a thesaurus could write a dishonestly baroque poem about the great fall of man tennysons ulysses is hardly like ammons garbage but they both utilize stream of consciousness relating to synonymous thematics and over a century separates the two    if you want to talk solely about bad poetry then have at it but to say an entire writing style based on emotion is bad because it doesnt follow a logical process then you are stuck in a specific frame of the past this isnt even including epistolary writing which has churned out arguably some of the greatest writing of the last few hundred years and follows egocentric writerdriven confessionals as its mainstay    itd be harder for me to find good writing written without being selfcentered than with poetry or otherwise
  i was basically saying the poem sounds like angsty teen poetry and what i described is basically what that is a diary entry written straight out of the head with some descriptive words bad rhyme and the put in an arbitrary visual structure    im not saying or insinuating anything about any other poets or poetry styles just bad teen angst poetry    and yes emotion is fine infact anything is fine if its written well    and i dont mean egocentric as in just from the self point of view obviously most poetry is i just mean that that type of poetry satisfies the writer more than the reader especially because it is personal
    am i really going to be the first one to point out that this fella just posted an emily dickinson poem
  the phone is ringing and i cannot linger  look out butt here comes my finger
  lets line up all the descriptions youve used to critique  sorry for putting your poem on blast  stream of consciousness  diary prose  random visual structure  looks like a poem faux poetry  bad  illogical structure  terrifying  bad rhyme  random structure  banal  egocentric  confessional  angsty  teenage  arbitrary visuals    couldnt name a single novel play essay song or poem let alone the authors thereof worth reading that wouldnt meet at least half of these descriptors thats going back all the way to the greeks critique can be objective if you disagree then you adhere to a strictly prepostmodernist demand for purism in art while subjecting your entire viewpoint to a postmodernist subjectivity of critique a better term for you to use is masturbatory if you mean to imply the writer is more satisfied from their writing than the audience but at that point youve let your critique die on the hill of absolute opinion    ps which poems are yours in the thread id like to read your writing
   holy shit  were all fucking pseuds good that you pointed that out anon      you fuckin hack game over
  yes descriptors can apply to multitudes of different things and topics as language is redundant but then you clearly dont or refuse to understand me  ive not taken a view on how poetry should be done in general im talking about a particular type of bad poetry im really sorry if ive used words which are so ambiguous theyre confusing to you but ive tried my best in the last post to specify what i mean      critique can be objective if you disagree then you adhere to a strictly prepostmodernist demand for purism in art while subjecting your entire viewpoint to a postmodernist subjectivity of critique     i dont really get what youre trying to say here or why you are saying it and like i said i wasnt making any general points about poetry      masturbatory  a less ambiguous description nonetheless i think its abit histrionic compared to what i actually mean    but at that point youve let your critique die on the hill of absolute opinion  what do you mean    ps  i havent got a poem on here
    as heard in the twilight footsteps beside me in the snow     hood over her eyes nose fresh with the red of roses     i tapped her head gently dusting off the snow    frozen in that transient second for an eternity to behold

i like my train  comes from the hill  never check my ticket  so black guy deal weed  ı light my cigar with the   warmness of my pimp

  t dunningkruger
  only real complaint i have is the meter is a bit wonky at times and in some places you seem a bit shackled by trying to maintain the rhyme scheme but i enjoyed everything else  i very much like the diction and the subject matter you did an excellent job of conveying the feeling of a journey to a foregin land with all the struggles and triumphs it entails  i dont often screencap poems but this will be one of them
  i really like it quite absurdist dont take the others advice couple awkward word couplings but they might even work in its favour and the rhyme repetition and lack of punctuation or intermissions works i think i wouldnt change it too much dont listen to those other bourgeois assholes
  this is good it is a joy to read something in a proper meter nice composition of each stanza  and a nice break from the structure with the last one it was a pleasant surprise that it turned away from the pessimism so prevalent in writings about this theme  well if i am correct in reading content as an imperative and not as an adjective  i regret that i am too much a pleb to see any flaws you will have to do with praise from me
im writing a long alliterative longline poem this is my opening id like some feedback on both the technical aspects and on anything else that strikes you      to drag on a dragons draughtful digression  to swallow a swallows high swooping suggestion  these words were to wake me in winter  i sat still silver all slipping on the window   were those words at all worthy of wonder   no naught but nostalgias with nonsense filled in  fragments i flayed but found empty  enough lines have existed each aeon  that any i arrived to had aged    the protagonist is going to go on to wander outside in the darkness thinking about these lines and poetry and be accosted by a dragon of doubt and a bird of aspiration before going back to bed
  well what do you think of the meter    your style already seems to have broken down by the second stanza    also alliteration doesnt work in the last line of stanza 1 because all 3 target words use different vowel sounds same with aeon on second last line    also dr and d dont work in alliteration as dr begins with a j sound not a d
    omg ha just realised thats not your second stanza  most of what i said still stands though
  the alliteration is really funky i like it intrigued by what a bird of aspiration could be    this isnt done yet its a sort of prose poem/possibly could add a haiku at the end to wrap it up props if you can guess what its about    an ashen white room as204     dress rehearsal your last dress rehearsal morning lola your last morning lola suiting up your last suiting up cantankerous asides your last cantankerous asides bacon and eggs your last bacon and eggs red gantry walk your last red gantry walk hatch slam the last slamming of the hatch 628pm your last 628pm     628pm 629pm 630pm 631pm   631pm   63101pmzap     the monster grew it started as a sneeze a stutter a little orange spark lurking beneath the command pilots seat perfect place perfect time it was to have a short existence of around twentyfive seconds it could never write a poem or crack a joke or design a flying machine it could only be born grow dance consume dance some more grow some more and then wilt and die     this was a fire it had a cycle like anything else it appeared out of nowhere and if the fire was a living thing with a cycle of birth everything inbetween and then death then so was its host the command module the command module had a vascular system  mechanicalbiological rhythms  constant electrical currents flowing through its copper veins
    thanks m8s ill take this into account especially the notes to mind my alliteration and assonance thoughminor note but aa/ax and aa/aa are both acceptable patterns to me i only need drag/drag/draught to alliterate  bird of aspiration is basically just an allegorical swallow that pushes him to dream big and hope to write what he wants it shows up first gets eaten by the dragon and then the dragon dies leaving the protagonist in the darkness of winter     its a toaster im fairly sure the bits before the times and after the times seem like separate poems though the style change from mourning to descriptive doesnt work for me
  ernot sure why i thought it was a household object its a rocket
when you are in the room your face is like the moon in a midnight sky  it is all i see  i cannot help but wish your light falling tenderly as a kiss upon me   your gaze is crisp and bright   and in the dark of night i crave it so  when i look up i see your eyes are not on me  your soft moonlight gazing upon he  how can i but fall into a daze  my moon has fallen down  that light that once shown so bright is now but a dreamy visage late at night
    really liked it just two things    your soft moonlight gazing upon he  using he in order to rhyme it sounds awkward    that light that once shown  did you mean shone
  it really makes me happy that you liked it   yeah the he is forced there but i dont know how to improve it without changing too much  and i did mean shone thanks for catching that and the feedback     can someone help me with punctuation should i be ending each line in a certain way are there rules in lyric poetry about how long lines should be or any other major points of form
  so who did you get cucked by fella you okay
  so thats it his aspirations hopes and dreams just destroyed you fucking monster
  no i just got infatuated with a girl who didnt like me
  worst feeling in the world dont ket girls fuck with you dont ever let them fuck you you need your mind for greater things
  welli meant that the dragon dies because it ate the bird which is poison to it ive been rejected a lot lately and i really feel like im not worth much as an intellectual who doesnt produce anything but im still going to keep trying that sort of feeling
  worst feeling in the world    certain and impending death   finding a girl you do like falling in love and then discovering gradually she has a severe mental illness which cannot be treated and she slowly drifts into madness over the course of years  discovering your entire family was burned alive in a horrible gas accident while you were out buying canned blueberries for a thanksgiving pie    i dunno anon
  i really hate poetry like this because it lacks any sort of story or emotion it masquerades as being emotional but you have nothing to say other than the girl i like likes someone else you add really basic imagery but it doesnt reenforce any point it is just there to make it seem poetic this isnt to say that you dont have a story to tell but you are refusing to tell it at all brother across 10 lines all you said was i like girl girl like someone else me sad also moon simile    please also commit to a rhyming structure or dont rhyme at all
  when you start with a rhyme even accidental it sets up for a formula that you didnt hold on to so id change either digression or suggestions    it is really hard to say how strong part of a poem is without the context of the whole while someone can tell you if something is a good first page in a book that is juts the way it is written and poetry is a lot more science than art it is more like a screenplay than prose it is less about what each line is like and more about how they fit into the big picture posting only part of a screenplay is essentially useless outside of basic small structure notes the kind you should only worry about if you are essentially new to the game
  what does this poem mean to you i am afraid to criticize without hearing any back story
i am having this one turned into a song and while i imagine it will change in order to fit a tune regardless of what i do with it i would appreciate any notes in touching this up
et in  here the garden pond lies still  unmoving  firmly held by the moss and lilies  and times ardent watch  lets no life spring forth any longer    in arcadia  here the garden tree has cast off its fetters  shade no more graces the wood  dead barren limbs  sprawling roots vying for light  oaks bury their face in shame    et in arcadia ego  and here the garden stone commands the eye  to look around its necessity  unyielding implacable  verdant hills have taken leave  hither stays his gaze    he is in arcadia  now and forever
  tell me the story behind this one
again filled with a nagging hunger for lost time   i claw at the remaining scraps of the day passed by  sucking on the bones of the night  to squeeze the last drops of light  knowing but disregarding that i would be better off sleeping now  and waking with a belly full of possibility  instead i lick up the stream of colorful empty pixels a feast for the eyes but calorie free  tomorrow i will wake up tomorrow groggy unwell famished  stomach empty again
  et in arcadia ego translates to i was in arcadia also taken to mean that death is there even in the greatest paradise i had an image of a english landscape garden with beautiful ponds and classical architecture and i heard the phrase
  it starts off strong but really gets weak in the second half i feel like there is more of a story you can tell here you certainly tkae it a step forward by going for the pixels but it really stands out with the metaphor being so persistent     it feels like you are a serious redraft away from this being a true poem
  is that all there is to it just the idea that even in beautiful places people die
  no its not about people dying but about time and nature maybe not the deepest of stuff but i liked it
  what about time and nature there is no need to hold back if poetry is meant to be subtle explaining poetry subtly misses the point of explaining it
  youre right to better explain ill include a painting you see these innocent naive shepherd boys in arcadia unaware of decay or suffering and they happen upon this tomb with the inscription et in arcadia ego the shepherds the garden itself  all of it is nature something like rousseaus idea of it anyway then once they see that tomb the idea of time and decay is introduced to them and their lives are the worse for it ponds become contaminated trees lose their leaves and the rock that immovable past bears down upon the entire garden
    i was walking in the quad with this girl i like after we just finished classes we were talking and having a good time and it was also snowing so i gently patted away snow from her hair and she froze for a split second there was no expression on her face she seemed really nervous for some reason but right afterwards we were talking and joking around again    she neither pulled away or smiled at me as i did the head pat what does that mean
    of course afterwards she decided to pull her hood up as the snow got heavier
  could you break down your poem in relation to that for me stanza by stanza i mean i find this really interesting i may be wrong but it sounds like you have the reverse of what most amateur poets have here
    i see certainly not for me but it would be hasty for me to criticize
    and of course i wrote this late at night while debussy clair de lune was playing and it reminded me of walking in the snow with her    so it was kind of hearing her footsteps in the twilight kind of thing    i really like this girl and it seems like her being nervous around me would mean shes crushing on me a little bit too right
    her being frozen in that short second that image of her expressionless face is being kept on playing in my mind as i slowly lost my mind loving her
  while debussy clair de lune  i love clar de lune this is going to sound stupid and edgy but you should listen to it backwards as well      i really like this girl and it seems like her being nervous around me would mean shes crushing on me a little bit too right  hard to say im more of a mans man and find most things about romance to be boring my own poetry is generally about the people in my life so mostly friends or mentors        i can look beyond the romance aspect to judge poetry objectively but yours seemed to offer nothing but the idea of romance and the idea of imagery i feel a lot of amateur poems do this yours at least played with a concise moment instead of just the vagueness of a romantic feeling like others in this thread though
  first stanza the et in i broke up like how eliot does at the end of his hollow men for thine isfor thine is the then i had an image of a placid pond lying still enclosed by time this is only an afterthought by when i put unmoving in a line of its own i wanted to drive home that particular word time is capitalized since i wanted it to be a clearly articulated subject a person almost     second stanza again broke up the original phrase i introduce my second symbol the tree and kill it i was careful about shade no more graces the wood since for whatever reason the word graces stuck out in my mind the entire time writing this i had to choose a good spot for it sprawling roots was meant to show a sense of urgency a last ditch effort to survive to live or move against the stillness of time     third stanza full phrase this time  completes the reading of the tomb inscription imagine that everything is happening as the shepherds are reading though unbeknownst to them the stone of course is the tomb itself they realize that the pond and tree are dead and so too the stone death incarnate has killed them in the background those verdant hills are retreating running away from the stone
  thanks this is good advice as with most of my poems i didnt do much revising but i think youre spot on so i might try reworking it
build a bus as you do for that girl you like  flowery metal petals ground welded out like a sun  belted out mechanized brutalities that without  the big head hammered back oil greaser  who keeps his hands clean nowadays just so you know  without him in full view shattered visors in rust cut tape  whod you have agape  blue lit some tit unreal just so  fertile ground looks growing up an outward spout  on a sunny mesa day
  i think simply transitioning out of that metaphor into the second stanza would fix a lot of the problems or simply just not being as persistent with it in your attempt to compare the desire for someone to hunger it just became about trying to talk about hunger without regard to the rest of the poems importance    really after the light it can be more or less removed and have your focus shift beyond that i think there is a bit more of a story you can tell here a lot of amateur poets try to write poems that are just thoughts or ideas they think this makes their poetry accessible but it is beyond accessible it is generic you are one step ahead of them by adding a bit of a progression with the scrolling through facebook which is what oyu meant by pixels i assume but its still just barely beyond an idea    keep the first stanza up through light more or less as it is and rework the rest into a second stanza and add a final act for a third stanza you got something to say there i think and being more precise will make this a true poem
the image of an orchid  suspended in a reflecting pool  the prick of a hummingbird beak  shatters the calm  sends shards of orchid rippling across the surface    greatness is not gained or lost  it is forged through toil  through the alchemy of words  dripping out in molten iron  hammered into shape  cooled with a sizzle    each stroke is a mask  each mask a sliver  leafing through skins  layers accreting falling away  like insect wings swept from a dusty windowsill    i peer through my curtains  at the neighbors across the street  searching for something to watch on tv  they cant seem to decide  i join them in indecision  torn between the perverse pleasure of peeping  and the productive flowering of words  as the night grows darker  and morning grows nearer  and all the weight of the world drags me further down into my uncomfortable bed    each sentence splits opens a seam  for the voice i choke back daily  the voice that speaks in riddles  that avoids the petty pleasantries  the small small small talk  the private voice    the pressures of the city force the private voice deep into my throat  headphones shut out the world  music or not  the voice does not speak to be understood  heard  but not understood  it wants to provoke other private voices to awaken  to cut past the falsecalm surface of the streets  make manifest the latent content of humanity  excavate the layers  expand the network of signifiers    the voice that keeps you awake at night is the same one that begs to be given an outlet in art  youre not an insomniac because you are anxious  youre anxious because your inner voice goes too often unprocessed  it whispers to you in ways you cant understand askingindirectly in thoughts bodily sensations illnessesto be let out dribbled out slapped onto the counter and kneaded into something you can taste    words poetry make for an easy translation  images can be easy to make  but harder to fill with a voice  in all pictures there is someone who speaks  the task then is to find the one who speaks  most often pictures descend from the others voice  occasionally we find ourselves in images  words bend to our will more easily  we string them along into daisy chains and assert our individuality though the chains bind us to prescripted meaning no matter how much we claim to escape it    i fear ive gone on too long already  i look back on the poem that im preparing to post on an indonesian basketweaving board  i sit up in my apartment staring again into the window of my neighbors room  i ponder the dynamics of myself a white gentrifier new to brooklyn looking into the window of a black family who has been here for years  i wonder if writing poems to keep myself awake is a valid pasttime  this is probably why everyone hates white twentysomethings  wondering if i belong here  if i can last in new york for a year  if i even want to  if i should kill myself  thoughts calcify like drying candlewax  the neighbors room goes dark  theyve found something to watch
  can you tell me what the first stanza and the second stanza have to do with one another
    thanks im actually not a poet just an engineering student that write short bits sometimes    i think so too i didnt really give any of my insights out in the poem it really wasnt even about love it was just about capturing a very specific moment and me pondering what that moment meant whilst in the twilight    though many times i feel like im stuck in the wrong degree and i wonder whether i could have became somebody with a better legacy if i gritted my teeth and pursued english during my last years in highschool    the song played backwards just sounds really off maybe like something i would enjoy if i played it alot of times and got used to it
    actually no the poem is 100 about love
  well very few people really are poets but even as a hobby its important to make sure you are doing some sort of baseline if you intend to share it in any form without any warning poems are at the end of the day stories and they need some sort of point to them what you did was give us a first act but you never really followed through    i think the easiest example i can find is called first fig  my candle burns at both ends  it will not last the night  but ahh my foes and ohh my friends  it casts a lovely light    its only four lines but your poem is the equivelent of the first two lines you set something up similar to st vincent but unlike her you never turn it around most poems in this thread are essentially just  my candle burns at both ends  it will not last the night  which is just people using imagery to masturbate or seem pretentious poetry isnt about injecting the mundane with imagery thats all style and no substance the imagery is there to support a point      its not about love it just has love in it there is a difference it could be about love but you say nothing about it
      here is an example in my own poem it is by no means special but structurally in terms of story not in terms of say metering it is very strong    the poem uses fire to describe unrequited love but to simply end it after any of the first four verses makes it just about a guy who loved a girl and then nothing happened by adding that final note of  it took all these scars for one man to learn  so please let the fire burn out  it completes the story by ending it in a different place than where it started its about what you learn from an experience or idea not what you simply had happen and refused to move forward with    a more mainstream example is stopping in the woods on a snowy evening by robert frost   whose woods these are i think i know   his house is in the village though   he will not see me stopping here   to watch his woods fill up with snow     my little horse must think it queer   to stop without a farmhouse near   between the woods and frozen lake   the darkest evening of the year     he gives his harness bells a shake   to ask if there is some mistake   the only other sounds the sweep   of easy wind and downy flake     the woods are lovely dark and deep   but i have promises to keep   and miles to go before i sleep   and miles to go before i sleep    the story is all about whether or not to stay there essentially to let himself die as it would be more peaceful than living but he finishes the story making it a true poem by having himself realize that while it is tempting the obligation to others must outweigh that
you make a poem and read it aloud   you tremble quite nervously  in front of a crowd   you might think im listening  but im really not   im actually thinking  bout how my dogs got     how shes been got by the worms  who ate up all her ashes  got by the germs  who excrete her as gases  but worst of all is  shes been got by me  her face is erased  from my brains memory     were her eyes black or brown  i really cant recall  feels like  i never knew  that old dog at all    the sad fact of life  is this happens to you  ill forget all your names  though i wish it werent true   well all die someday  and pay up lifes taxes    get got by some worms  wholl eat up all our ashes
  nice to read a poem with a point im not a fan of the structure or all the imagery but its nice to see someone who actually wants to say something and says it really well favorite poem in this entire thread
    yes i suppose its an image of a person being in love with another but the poem is about taking the image and putting it into words    okay i just read your second post i think ill try the poem again    to ponder    as heard in the twilight footsteps beside me in the snow    hood over her eyes nose fresh with the red of roses    i tapped her head gently dusting off the snow    frozen in the transient second for an eternity to behold    an eternity is not enough to ponder her soul    7th floor in the fortress of sanguinary aspirations caught again in the reverberations of love and sedation    ruminating luminance as ink for my petty vexations diverging thoughts fan fires for my useless creations    a transient portrait of the anachronists sorrow the eternal road of self castigation    clipped wings flutter in the dark azure a moon paler than the stars and snow    an eternity is not enough to ponder my soul        okay i think that was it thanks man i think i understood and grasped the concepts you said and applied it nicely here
  but the poem is about taking the image and putting it into words  it isnt about that though it does that but its not about that    the poem itsself  be careful with reddit spacing man especially in a poem you should only be putting big spaces between stanzas that being said this is pretty much what i was talking about though id hardly advise this be a final draft especially iwth the difference in metering and how many lines end iwth the word snow    id also get rid of the an eternity is not enough to ponder her soul or at least switch it up i understand that you wanted to make it a direct comparrison to the final verse with your own soul but as its halfway through the poem it doesnt feel very cohesive though as i typed that i could see it working if its the final line of the previous stanza all the more reason not to use reddit spacing here    i also feel like you go overboard not just in the length of each line but you try too hard to use complex sentence structure and the intensity of your vocabulary shoots up in the second stanza as well there is nothing wrong with using a better vocabulary but it doesnt really match the first stanza now  over all though yes thats what its about youre now making a point about the poetry
  based and poetpilled
  punctuation is just as important in poetry without it half your verses seem incomplete and half of them feel like they never end or connect where they shouldnt im not talking commas in the middle im talking periods at the end
    then it is a poem that sets a scene but what its about is up to the reader to decide    i honestly dont know now what was my first poem about anyway    i guess i could justify first part of the poem as her writing for herself and the second part as me writing for myself though really its just hard for me to keep writing on a poem that i think ends quite nicely by itself thanks for the pointers man sorry im neither qualified nor able to give you any feedback but i did read and enjoyed your poems and hope you do well    to ponder    as heard in the twilight footsteps beside me in the snow  hood over her eyes nose fresh with the red of roses  i tapped her head gently dusting off the flakes  frozen in the transient second for an eternity to behold  an eternity is not enough to ponder her soul    a transient portrait of the anachronists sorrow the eternal road of self castigation  7th floor in the fortress of sanguinary aspirations caught again in the reverberations of love and sedation  ruminating luminance as ink for my petty vexations diverging thoughts fan fires for my useless creations  clipped wings flutter in the dark azure a moon paler than the stars and snow  an eternity is not enough to ponder my soul
  but what its about is up to the reader to decide  thats not a thing the closest that comes to being a thing is when someone makes an argument for two different ideas and leaves the ending in a way that both sides could be interpreted as winning out its an experiment in literature that suggests that neither side is right so to have a concrete ending would be a disservice to one of the sides by letting the people decide you are saying that their preference which often times is their moral preference is what matters there is no answer it is your reason for having your answer that matters    that is clearly not the case you just tried to write a poem about something that happened and didnt really know enough about poetry to see it through imagine if someone just wrote your first draft as a short story for instance its not a story its an excerpt a moment     what was my first poem about anyway  you never really decided is my point its kind of like you had the idea for a book and wrote a summary without deciding what it was really about its a first step and nothing wrong with it but not a poem in and of its self its a thought    i guess i could justify first part of the poem as her writing for herself and the second part as me writing for myself   i think your second draft really speaks for its self already its about whether or not you can truly appreciate someone by looking at this woman and trying to appreciate her you find that an eternity its self isnt even enough time to do that and by extension an eternity isnt enough time to experience yourself     sorry im neither qualified nor able to give you any feedback but i did read and enjoyed your poems and hope you do well  sure you are ive written like 6 poems in my life all opinions matter sure some may be wrong but you cant really know that unless someone gives an opinion and you see if it matches up with other peoples    one persons opinion is a bias but multiple peoples is a problem and i appreciate any feedback or criticism you can give im a bit bummed cuz i came in hoping to get help on some of my poems and spent the last few hours giving feedback to others but no one has done anything for mine    you seriously need to use some punctuation though particularly if you are going to use a higher end vocabulary because without it we dont know where one thought ends and another begins that wouldnt be so bad if you were using complete sentences but you arent you drop a lot of basic words to make it sound more old timey poetic which is fine but it makes it impossible to follow along without knowing where the period goes
    hmmm okay so for the fire poem at first i thought about how it was a tad too long than it needs to be maybe one or two stanzas could be cut out and the idea of the poem would still be the same because the idea is mostly conveyed by setting a premise in the first stanza and resolving it in the last the stanzas in the middle just helps to build that illusion of time and effort and thought you put into that relationship but then i saw that each stanza offers its own unique valuable insight of the story though i still feel like making it concise would help the poem more    its 2 51 am where i live and im writing on my phone but tomorrow morning i can critique all six of your poems if you post them all
  nah the only one i really want critiqued is the renaissance man as thats being turned into a song soon i doubt this thread will be up then anyways good notes on the let it burn poem though i feel like both poems may have that problem 5 act structure is too much but when trying to fit it into 4 acts or stanzas i always felt like i missed a step particularly in the renaissance man one as every stanza is about very particular moments that defined our relationship and how i admire him and what i worry about etc

weirdo    for some people there seems to be   under specific circumstances   a nefarious and certain possibility of loneliness  and these unlucky feel sodden with a fetid mildew   of a harrowing milieu   that chokes vowels  and in some ways they feel castrated  moving slowly in convoluted ovals   pulled down by a strong heady concoction   of senile madness at a vulnerable age    call it personal lethargy   or weakness and apostasy to current existence  the load remains unchanged   sullying folk denying them freshness and vigour  the wallet in their pocket chock full of glib predispositions  their mental health a brief glimpse into the  thickly padded ball bearings of the eternal universal grind  the gulag for masters and slaves  losers and winners  freedom and falsity    anyways i was    three words left reverberating in a tiny thought transposed    from hot and prickled hands    deep into the pickled mind of a tired man submersed   by verses subatomic   created and inscribed inside him by caustic weather   infused emotion and a fraction of sleep  i know my fashion has the cold heart of a killer  those arent my words but your silence is damning  anyways i was  thick pills and oiled noses streaking viciously   down high windows of the chalked mind  they tell him to clear himself  or they tell him nothing  they look off or walk away  his journey unimportant or too intense  left alone again with seemingly impervious devices  on the brink think alba dover  rattle with me in the tense tautology of my existence  between hysteria and function   and so i brave the naught   the engulfing zero  it was always me and always will be  i feel unsatisfying solace in the dead of night  hands around my throat   i write my poems with my tears on gravestones in randwick  couldnt hear the priest come close to me  but i felt him   god knows im not alone  he knows ill never find someone quite like you  again not my words   but my tears soaked into the gravestone  of someone i didnt know  this is where i left my mind in that graveyard on that morning

i shove up through the old plantation  larch  out of season drab drained of all greenness  widowed princesses in motheaten furs   and stumble out on the lap of the moor  rotten and rusted a fivebar gate  lies felled in the mud letting the fields escape    winter is late and light this year thin snow  half puddled sun still trapped in the earth  sludge underfoot all the way to the ridge    and none of the stuff that i came here to find  except in a high nick at the valley head  where a wet northfacing lintel of rock  has cornered and cupped enough of the wind  for running water to freeze icicles    once i unrooted some sixfoot tusk  from the waterfalls crystallised overhang  lowered it down and stood it on end then stared  at an iceage locked in its glassy depths  at far hills bottled in its weird lens    these are brittle and timid and rare and weep  in my gloved fist as i ferry them home  id wanted to offer my daughter  a taste of the glacier a sense of the world  being pinned in place by a diamondlike cold  at each pole but opening up my hand  theres nothing to pass on nothing to hold

  am i missing something i dont get it
they march as one behind the drum and never plan to rest  they do not know which way they go for that is not their quest  a crunch a squeal and in their zeal death is left behind  weve come so far we cant turn back please pay that no mind    cowering a child cries what are you marching for  progress of course you silly thing the crowds reply a roar  but for what sake for in your wake all that was is gone  except for that wretched drum banging on and on and on
  and ts eliot dont forget ts eliot
  the woods would be very silent if only the best birds sang too many people even writing poems is a good thing even if the quality is i should say average    the rhythm of the poem paces fine subjects runny and blah but at least its clear could use a good cutting down/
  best i can gather its about broke brass musician and war otherwise its garbled gimcrack
nighttime walks in rainlight  my thought are in plain sight awaiting their collection  i want to tie them all up  put them in dresses and  place them all pretty in a grand cogniscient dollhouse  with a dash of inconciveable chaos for my own dramatic and philosophical pleasure  and some sadness for my leisure    i walk when im on the verge   the brink of a step in a new direction   i walk on this path to contemplate the paths i will take  i will often face advance toward my fate    my shins hurt  but my sins birth new panoramas   perspectives importance  and new destinations   i want to make terrible desicions   so i can experience living with imperfections  and so i can filter those imperfections  through a lens of introspection  and achieve the purity in perfect stepping    so still i walk  sometimes i walk towards the fertile   sometimes i walk in a circle  sometimes i walk towards a place that is nothing at all  till my troubles are something to call toward for strength  and even when still in the length of my trek  im still on my quest  till i find my peace on distress
    best one here fuck words
    thanks for the feedback i usually stay away from poetry but i figured id try my hand at it
  its not poetry its prose
  nice bait but im not taking it
  im not joking justify to me why its poetry
  nvm wrong guy by accident yeah was a great poem
  now this is a poem beautiful  a show the rest of /lit/ how to do it bro
  why did he ruin poetry young boy
  get a career as a songwriter ft
  dont pat attention to the brainlet his jargon provides the air of being an intellectual without him having to actually be one which is why he adopted it in the first place he obviously has a lot of your selfworth wrapped up in that persona ultimately he overuse of cliches simply betrays a tendency toward pseudointellectualism    i wont tell you its beyond criticism it certainly can be improved but the core idea is really great i enjoyed it
  to be honest if its a song i wont particularly care about its lyrics i would be rather fond of a song that repeats a line or two in every stanza    the only thing i would really change is the last line    from    i didnt want you to leave    to    i dont want you to leave
  tense is important to the actual story i wrote the poem well after that tangled web that i weaved its important to know in the end that the renaissance man did leave at least to me it is
  by far the best poem ive seen on 4chan
  beautiful lad
every night    i lay drunk and i listen  to the shellfish scuttling  across my eyes  visions of a new humanity are  drawn in dribble with the  uninformed fingers of pissedoff fandango dancers  belligerent adulterated happiness  comes through my brain in sniping beats and whinnies  shooting holes in  tinboat dreams drowning in drought  brought about when a hosanna superstar left town for the night  eager to escape the twinfaces that perturb and beat down truth    in my minds eye  there is a woman raped and pillaged of her youth  then stoned  she floats like smoke  crumbling through the mirrored city  slitting her throat    as the beads of her life drum the pavement into a rife  booming rhythm that makes snails  slide under tires  cracking like littlethunder  others shake drenched in gods sweat  the shiny monochrome rivers oozing frightfully thick  making girls in stilettos stick or trip  on the naturebombed concrete  that sleeps a manmade death  under the refurbished robotics of dr tj eckleburg  the eyes now updated technological monoliths  lasers in the night  that have been draped on the world  like a curtain made from a red dress    the eyes of new world order  hover above like dark metallic angels  singing a silent song that sounds like mental anguish    true rainmen huddle away from modernity  because the united state of the song is loud and tearing in their brilliant minds  whilst fanciful men hold reign with practiced subjugation  using cameras to make and break  sentinels sit with gleaming slits  they are are perched on the knife edges of buildings  never closing their buzzing vision  all our failures  and our revoltingly docile  everything is alright yes  is a good use of suffocating irony   just read a damn book  you burst forth speaking in my mind like a ghost  i watched the movie  i see no flicker in your eyes  reflecting my own  has the green light died    the scuttling falls away into the dark night  i try to rest my case among remnants of atlantis  in a swimming pool filled with broken hopes and dreams  a shattered mirror now reflects the moon  but i lack the means to perform such a feat    kill the body and the head will die    not in this situation good judas  not again  good judas    i look up  opening my chest that cracks and groans  letting the night feast on my twisted organs  in the shimmering dark
burning thumbs on cigarettes  in a tight cell full of mirrors  screaming to the heavens like a priest with tourettes  i just wanna let you know that so many times i have dreamt of letting you go  but your words hang like lead metaphors in my soul  and the nightmare arises as a foul and deceitful horror on the horizon  and thats got me warring desperately against your wailing soul as it is pulled from death  desiring me calling me commanding me  youll never let me go you say    thats what you say    thats what you say    thats what you say    with your charcoal eyes and monroe hips  perfectly displayed in these painfully old pictures  with your messages inscribed on the back  devilish desires tattooed without tact  you have buried your ink deep into my skin your soul has become a part of me and so i can still find you deep within  and i cant free myself from you  that is my sin as you are calling me begging me  drawing me into your poor fabric tattered with lethargy  dragging me deep into harmful empathy  youre always there late at night just out of sight beside my bed  still cold and calling    incessantly    and you are the most beautiful suicide  and you are like a samurai facing machine guns  and you are brilliant in the setting sun  and you are sure my words batter the ceiling like moths to a flame rolling back and forth eternally like pebbles on the cold and restless shore but as long as you listen ill keep instigating these desires forevermore    but youre not listening anymore  youre just watching me crawl  and i could almost forget your name  i could almost forget what i found myself for  if these similes would just stop making sense
i get fucking fired up when these realisations hit me  causing me to sit lonely violently  deliriously drenched in steaming sweat  because my desires for you just wont expire  no matter how long i leave them burning on this funeral pyre  words keep flooding my mind  tidal waves of thought fighting my man kind  and what it means to be kind  has got me questioning your motives too brutally outlined in your face that still writhes frantically in my memory like worms in a rich and rotten cemetery  and youre devouring the very lives that fought the very misery  that now invades my thought internally eternally  and when you look at me  darling  i am suffering from emotional dysentery  and many wouldnt notice this externally  but you seem to have known me better than my own family or perhaps you were just lucky because you are the paris to my achilles  heal is what i need to do  but because of you  im thinking through this maze of forlorn produce  this compost heap of subversive devil juice  if i could just produce some weapon powerful against you  my angst wouldnt be so bemused  by the bastard handcuffs that hold me to you  like graverobbers who fall in love with the dugupdeceased  wise men say that i should let sleeping dogs lie   but my memory keeps you alive and youre always barking temptations into my mind late at night    keep sipping on your pardoning justifications and ill keep tearing up my lovedrenched letters    but not this letter not this time next time think  before you send me to the brink  ice melts in the summer but your vices never consider  that seasons may not change where the moon and sun do not range  across the landscape of true devotion   like weather that doesnt care for your insurance complex   hail comes down hard whether or not cars are parked seductively outside your door    you fucking whore    this is the valentines that you will never receive unless of course i slip this knife into my sleeve and slice the postman on the thirteenth  the fucking eve of the romantic monstrosity  that holds society for a few hours as desperate lovers pen letters to each other  afraid that their lust will die undiscovered  but this has finally come full circle and i thank god for the return to sender  whilst i watch embers burn these words into darkness as the flames gnaw and groan against the same fucking eyes that sent messages into your brain  my witness to your uncouthness grows full strength bellowing and blowing away your likeness  it was in these twilight hours when you used to bear witness to the fucking devotions that now seem to fall weightless against your breast breathless
never again will i lash out romantically  drowning you in nonsense that defies eternity  never again will you fly against my reasons repeatedly  ill be here forever and now youre not even a memory  never again will i share my heart distractedly  id like to believe that there are too many beautiful people to deny permanently    so this is good bye my sweet valentine  this is my valedictory  and darling    i have graduated from your school of madness with full marks  my doctorate is written in dark scars on my fleshy heart    and my thesis you would have just read  if it werent for the sad fact that youre dead    so rest in pieces  my darling  my undesired desire  my vitriolic valentine    rest    in    pieces
the ancient fires returned with mystic timing   some blazed and raced over the land   some lazed around dazed plants intertwining hot licks with green brown red  furry feathered shelled and scaled wicks   everything a wick  everything alive became alight   like clockwork the fires danced together    became mystery    became new life   this humble fire healthy and noble  sat upon the land   recycling soil and stars
i take off my watch as the children call for guides to tell the time  but i have not ever   not ever   not ever felt the fucking feeling akin to spreading freedom  children constantly remind me of the potentiality   that i hate to imagine superseding myself    hanging feelings   rolling like ghouls in the darkness   are pushed back because  there is one man that tells me through an absence of acknowledgement   that i need to keep moving into the dark chapels    but he keeps talking loudly and pointing to the darkened pictures  and when he does this  he utters in a snakewhisper that i am a part of the coloured squares  as if nobody else is allowed to hear this moment    he keeps showing me through the cigars that he smokes  that i need to keep searching for a place to show my lapels  he shows me that there is a treasure hidden away  he draws diagrams in the air with smoke blown from his mushylungs    i think that i am just another passerby   another one doomed to the lake of fire  but he knows i am from an old time  a time when wars and sacrifices actually meant something  but he has distorted it as if i must hail to primes that call me to fuck winedup  i must fuck the primes that now place in front of me the absence of my lifetime    primeministers denote exactly what my society takes upon them at this time   but when he tells me to stop and to be steady   and to watch the picture above the chapel   i wonder if what i am here for is just another foil   because all in all we have to watch our own backs or we shall fall  or even worse maybe i am just his character used and abused like a little pawn  a little porn here and there never hurt anybody right    perhaps i am only here to lark like a coloured bird  amidst the fake frolicking people that cannot seem to discern  between the chairs and the tables    they keep placing their faith on the fools as i am sitting on stools  and bearing my soul through my enabling of the true sacred   day dreams always lure me away from reality  and he knows this as  he screams from the entrance  that i am not becoming faith hence  he leads me out of the shrine now  where i must do my time   how  i do not know   but he leads me on through sand and snow  constantly pulling my lips into sentences  and twisting them into dairycoloured fables  that were never meant to see the light of day    i pray  i pay    paying for goods that are not mine  i am stepping in between each stony thorn that rises constantly  seeking some sort of ridiculous ingenuity  here thorns could be crosses or corsets or crowns
  i am not the person to start naming names or naming towns  cities scare me tearing heavens with sky scrapers and  i am just the bearer of this time and this departure  i truly have no land no place for storm to strike no pasture    i have no mother i have no daughter no son and no father    yet he still screams from the entrance of my mind  raiding my life with his verbal cosmic ether  except this time it is different  i know this as my hands rise and clasp around throat  blood booming like thunder  flesh on flesh  tightening like vices on wretches  children killing children in brooklyn  these muscles understand the fallacy  of the broken generation  hunter became  hunted    lights abound like violent sounds whilst feathersouls drop   and loop around me forming ivoryscaffolding   where my old yellow bones once shook and trembled in fuming indignation   i never knew death would feel this good    this is truly right and so i proceed historically  augmented in proper faith i walk through my life where i see  soft sullen faces exploding in the background of my old home  mother is playing vera and the colours of the wall shine through  the house constantly crawling between her awful womb and my throne  like some crazy diamond unleashed through my muse it kills true    i burn like a molten sun into the most magnificent sunset  but i am not fulfilled  still misunderstood  still on fire    i still do not understand the pleasures that he pushed into my eyes  when he cussed and darkened the lids that held my world between two fleshy cups    he figured that eternity would right his wrongs   completely missing the point when he drew his sword and struck the wooden stock from the wall  as the world crumbled down around me like rome from pages wronged  i mopped the blood from the ancient towns and i denied the sins    and he still   still misunderstood that    eternity    eternity would    right    right his    wrongs    so    so in darkness i shed my painful ailments  learning a sight that only comes from tears and the tearing of ridiculous dreams  i released the anguish of my soul and the semipermanent stain of ignorant yolk  because i finally understood the universe is big enough to hold the sin of mankind and myself
  somehow someone will keep sucking and   pushing blood down into the womb of the world  denying the existence of the center with words preached from   healthy blood caked bodies    losing sight gave me the chance to realize truth and so i see it all everything  they now gaze upon my looming figure   noticing the truth in my sunken sockets and so they bow    i am growing true upon this sintouched yet truthburnt hearth  i feel it in the minds of the masses and muses    the same hearth that held my death  has now become the rock of my rebirth    it is from this place  that i shall rule the earth
                shit
  and i can tell most of it is 1 person
  love it
    just a reminder that this isnt about judging poetry poetry is subjective
  t idiot you decided to post his worthless shit
  youre obviously moved by it i wonder why that is what does your anger hide you seem green
      dont criticize what you cant understand
  publish it
  so youre taking the detached psychological observer approach i must say while it has been done to death maybe you can add some nuance to it my anger as you have so astutely pointed at doesnt even hide but blatantly declares my intense hatred for you
    this thread is about criticising poetry not comments so shut your fucking mouth or give a review
  im just wondering why youre so detached from reality and full of anger you seem very minute       still delusional i see

  again with this nonsense i think maybe  if youll let me play the armchair shrink for a minute  you yourself are particularly angry yet are so mired in passivity that you cloak said anger with these observations about how minute i must be to be filled with hatred over some text on my computer
  blinking in the stark light of reality  burning  illuminating  pulsing against the shadow gurgling within morose victimfilled mind sewers  that weakly drain away vigorous thinking  and the deformed dormant difficult dance of impermanent power    and i know your power  and i know your flavour  sentimental boats in a tiny beach  where people lay around on lit rocks  swimming in perfectly clear water  and people have died here  on this spot  in this place  this textured power  this flavour  like a song you lay there  awaiting the awful poking collapse  of my falling  empty pen  and you turn and watch my flicking  nonsleeping arm  and await the date when you can confirm with me  this disability  of my soul  deep conscience tormented  how could it not be  nightmares fermented in the soulful glimpses of paradox and reality and the coldest soberest mornings still hit like a drug  and twist the brain inside the skull  and roll the eyes and dot the tees  with nosebleeds and cum    you can look at me like a map  of consuming despair  i am there  and you are here  and you are he  and me   in such a long song  the biggest ever  taller than the tallest drunk  and he   on the brink and he has no answer why  why is he on the brink  and he is so tall    you turn to me   you are always turning to me  and you answer  softly   as if you do not care
  what per se did i say that was deluded show me your poem thats the only way ill judge u coz im not a pedantic cunt
  except for perhaps  the shaking shins  quivering knuckles   and the gyre gut of a thousand unborn miracles  here i spill it  drawing us together  like two puddles coming connected  colourful petrol born  nuances of portayal  i am drawn  and you are free  still so virgin  you evade me  and the moments  how  how do you dance between the embers  you are so frozen in my mind each night  do you consume the fire  do you delight in the pyre  do you recreate me when i am done and dusted  do you birth me in your bright morning    and he fell    i do  i try  i do in the dark of night  distinct mother poets embrace him  falling child  i do   twice and twice more  twice   and twice more    there was a soft splash    and she turned again and said  softly  as if she did not care    however  do not forget eternity  scrawled with dignity on sin denying streets  of healthy homeless  of cancerous business folk  and within the twang of middle class hero  singing out of tune to the coming night  the tune when so many politicians write wrongly  nullifying the potential to right the wrongs  look at you clairvoyant prophet critic  a society lays dormant  door mat for the ill composed  watch as the friars freak on ghost smoke  laying like seduction on window sills  swollen with dripped ink  from a nervous shaking pen  that was meant to be rewriting the walls  and giving birth to new roads  someones guilt  fills the ill commissioned cells  and the last one now  throttles the first  here i have been quaking  forever to just tell you  i love you  with the selfless jazz heart  of red wine titanic  melting the cold shipwrecks  of yesteryear  rebirthing faded parades  in glorious hues of saturn  galactic sundown  every evening  and chosen to show  the diverse beauty of a single moment  one note  in tune  echoes out over city over memphis  and it is my love for you  over lonegrass evaporation and cloudbuilding escalation  and loving the strong sense of purpose  it is my love for you  the place of memory and fate  where we remember tomorrow  and our objectives  desires  conspiracies of love   the creative moment  dreams of heaven above  and here we are at last  so very potent  unlocked
  and more than brass  we human beings  we lucky few  settle our limbs   comfort the weary  with pens empty of ink  sing old songs  sing new songs  sing    and there we sat  among the many  as the body floated by  and children screamed  but it was impossible to tell  if they were happy  or if they were  sad

retards      poet simon armitage has won the prestigious keatsshelley prize 2010     his winning poem the present was inspired by the winter of 2008/09 when his daughter wasnt very well     simon went up on the moor near his huddersfield home in search of icicles to cheer her up  sadly he came back empty handed     all of the poems entered for the pounds 1000 prize were judged without a name and simon is the highest profile poet to have won it so far     the prize was established to encourage talented poets and essayists of all ages and walks of life to write on romantic themes  poems of modern relevance and romantic inspiration and essays on keats shelley byron or mary shelley     simon of marsden said im not sure if its possible to be a romantic poet anymore but more and more poets seem to be turning their eye towards nature to the necessity of its otherness its hard to explain but speaking personally if the birds and the moors and the trees and the ice disappeared then i would have no interest in writing about a city street and probably no purpose as a poet
  woah better poem than youll ever make

the expression of the face balks account  but the expression of a wellmade man appears not only in his face  it is in his limbs and joints also it is curiously in the joints of his hips and wrists  it is in his walk the carriage of his neck the flex of his waist and knees dress does not hide him  the strong sweet quality he has strikes through the cotton and broadcloth  to see him pass conveys as much as the best poem perhaps more  you linger to see his back and the back of his neck and shoulderside
is there any book i can read that will help me come to terms with the historical futility of being a woman

thanks for the laugh op
introduces twentynine 29 fucking characters  promise four 4 stories from each  thats one hundred and sixteen 116 in total  only finish twenty four  still runs over seventeen thousand lines  what was chaucer thinking
  imagine what you would do without a job a television internet etc
  what was chaucer thinking  dude contemporary english society lmao
  should i take a class just on chaucer next semester i feel like it could be pretty interesting did he write anything besides the canterbury tales
  youre thinking of taking a class on chaucer yet you wont google what other stuff he wrote
  his magnum opus is his treatise on the astrolabe
  should i take a class just on chaucer next semester  yes
and then he farted lol  what did the father of english literature mean by this
we must allow ourselves to think we must dare to think even though we fail it is in the nature of things that we always fail because we suddenly find it impossible to order our thoughts because the process of thinking requires us to consider every thought there is every possible thought fundamentally we have always failed like all the others whoever they were even the greatest minds at some point they suddenly failed and their system collapsed as is proved by their writings which we admire because they venture farthest into failure to think is to fail i thought  i am convinced there is no one more based and blackpilled than bernhard
guys is there an english word for the literary issue of sprachskepsis im sorry that im a kraut but please just help me out here lads
  going off a quick google search it seems to generally be translated as linguistic skepticism or language skepticism which is a bit of an awkward and unevocative phrase in english when and how often do people talk about sprachskepsis in german
  nope  its specific to german philology in a specific timeframe english never translated it only its fruits
wut sprachkesesisch mean me brainlet
what you are referring to is a movement in the philosophy of language which was the realizing that language does not and cannot equate to the things they represent and that language is only representative therefore language is arbitrary and we have to think of other theories of how to justify its meaning the german word you use implies that the best way to use language is through expressive poetic use of language in a way which best expresses ideas  this is why i think a lot of german and french philosophers in fact created new words think heidegger and dasein to express their concepts

  im used to it again thats why i said its fine i used to browse /mu/ myself for a while it honestly wasnt so much a genuine question as it was simply to make you take a step back and look at what youre doing either you end up not giving a fuck or you say maybe that was unnecessary    why would you listen to x when y exists  as trite as it sounds it all devolves into because it sounds good idk what else to tell ya ill check out the albums youve posted though

  napalm death ruined metal take your pc bullshit somewhere else faglord
  some of the best grindcore ever made  ruined metal
  the bible by oliver from deep cuts
  i think you meant to say carcass napalm is meme music and it always has been you suffer is a joke and the whole band only existed to funnel the progressive element of hardcore into metal wence heshers promptly kicked the shit out of    its just all so tiring
  early carcass ie reek of putrefaction era and early napalm death ie scum feto peel sessions recordings generally the material recorded between 19871989 are very similar in every way  production instrumentation song structures even the lyrics have a similar focus on social issues where napalm commented on various topics with a direct and straightforward lyrical approach similar to hardcore punk and thrashcore a la discharge siege deep wound etc carcass did the same while using gore as a metaphor pointing towards many of the same issues symphonies of sickness  an album with a similar aesthetic approach as reek but musically much closer to death metal  had a cover consisting of a collage of animal meat products a reference to reek the art of which was a collage of human corpses it was a comment on animal rights since all members were vegetarians also jeff walker designed the album art for napalm deaths scum and the classic nd logo as well iirc  you suffer is a joke  you suffer being a joke does not detract from the influence and quality of napalm deaths body of work it is a joke that has been replicated many times mostly as an homage and wehrmacht did the same joke even earlier the song e so i dint see why it would be a bad thing also it was on the scum album not feto which is the album i posted  the whole band only existed to funnel the progressive element of hardcore into metal  wtf  wence heshers promptly kicked the shit out of  youre just making shit up napalm death were immensely successful with both metal and punk crowds during the late 1980s actually it was punk elitists that pushed the band to play death metal starting from 1990 feel free to read some interviews from that time harmony corruption and utopia banished are also classics    tldr youre a cocksquatter with shit taste and zero knowledge on this subject go back to reading rym and metal archives reviews
  a farewell to arms
  wow you actually have some small knowledge of the music youre talking about so you know already that napalm is a deeply divisive and hated band in the metal crowd ofcourse theyre similar stylistically you cocksmoking faglord its why i brought it up in the first place most early thrash and grind is far superior to napalm who couldnt even hold down band members on both sides of scum while they were getting their punk royalty dicks sucked by the likes of john peel most of their peers were more worried about getting pussy and partying i like a lot of the napalm records sonically and even own the one you posted on first press vinyl but their lyrics are a joke napalm is bascially a cover band wether its their own material or nazi punks fuck off and theyre part of the entire stench scene that utterly brought down hardcore and almost brought down metal you dont need to waste time namedropping bands lol siege and heresy wrote better music than any of the bands listed so far     the only reason anyone bothers with this band is because they keep putting out material  the morr recent albums being superior  and even more than that their silly hippies politics give me metal fans and a 19 year old that wants to tongue my butt and a repulsion record over the horn rimmed glass nerds that get hard over napalm any day
                                                stop listening to jazz
  a bit too negro for your tastes
and anything that sounds like it please
  im gonna refrain from calling you a tasteless dickhopper once more because you namedropped repulsion but your butthurt over nd is showing   napalm is a deeply divisive and hated band in the metal crowd  not everyone is obsessed with the personal politics of whatever bands they enjoy also  capitalizing genres  lol arghoslent are definitely more divisive even burzum is more divisive and that asshole vargs been spending the past several years making shitty videos instead of shitty music  couldnt even hold down band members on both sides of scum  you do realize side a and b were originally intended to be released separately right  theyre part of the entire stench scene that utterly brought down hardcore and almost brought down metal  you sound mad  im also not sure which one is the more ridiculous hyperbole calling them basically a cover band or considering their more recent albums superior but i aint even mad go listen to some terrorizer and chill the fuck out

  youre royally fucked man im sorry
  sylvia plath now before its too late
byron
  i agree get her on plath and you can still salvage her then introduce her to de beauvoir although shes not a poet she fits the bill
 and emily dickinson depending on whether the edgy is depressed or eccentric basically is she more like lisa germano or joanna newsom  also romantics could work if shes that kind of emotional
thanks for all of the suggestions so far i really appreciate it guys    shes a bit eccentric but not much shell make edgy jokes about suicidedepression but shes not all woe is me overall shes a pretty average girl in regards to social media  interests but she responds to mild politicallyincorrect jokes pretty well since we make them every single day  she has shown some interest in the more emotional types of poetry but as far as i know she has never read any quality poetry in her life i dont really know anything about the romantics but she would probably be interested in poetry that places emphasis on feelings

i wrote every single poem and you want me to write you a poem wow
humour is one of the greatest mysteries of the universe even the best comedian in the world cant really tell why his jokes work he just knows which does and which doesnt its impossible to tell why our brain responded to a good joke or why it discarded a bad one numerous attempts have been made to break down comedy and theorise it but all of them are far from accurate because comedy is full of outliers and the moment you try to theorise it youve failed to understand comedy
i like 4chan memes too
agreed
is there any writer who mixes several genres like some scenes being full slice of life others romance the world is fantasy about some sci fi gods who watch a medieval world for study while has grimdark violence scenes and happy comedy in the feel good scenes after a violent battle with the villain

the world is fantasy about some sci fi gods who watch a medieval world for study  thanks for the plot idea now i can write about some fantasy group having some epic adventure to stop some evil king while some advanced civilization observes their struggles with the observation being illegal so the people have to hide the epic fantasy world thus causing complications for the science fiction side and possible accidental bleedthrough to the fantasy side and then people start panicking and shit hits the fan  copyright

have you read it
  the first few pages hell of boring
yesh   i know hobbes well
  i wrote an extended answer for a hobbes thread like 6 months ago on whether hobbes commonwealth is possible in a secular society but the thread 404d before i could post it anyone want me to dump it here
  ye
not only did i disagree with hobbes conclusions i find his assumptions his arguments based entirely in christian perspective essentially worthless the only value this tract served to me is to know thy enemy this is a classic example of mental circus tricks being used to justify the march of christian dominance across the globe i cant think of any written text that i despise more except perhaps mein kempf    hobbes is my least favorite philosopher he embodies everything i despise in western thought if i met hobbes in the street i would flash him my tits and then slap him in the face and call him a pervert
  okay here we go i cant actually remember what i say in it but im sure its good    is hobbes vision of the commonwealth compatible with a secular society  bearing in mind most of his main ideas are set out in chapter 42 in the of a christian commonwealth section is it possible to have a sovereigntybased state without an overtly christian dogma underpinning its structure    firstly im not sure why you would think that most of hobbes main ideas on the commonwealth are set out in chapter 42 but its an interesting question nonetheless this may be a little meandering but i do think that to answer this question we need to have a broad understanding of hobbes and his project first in short i do think that hobbes conception of sovereignty is compatible with a secular society however it is unlikely that hobbes believed that such a society could exist his goal was the subordination of religious authority under civil authority through the joining of both hobbes arguments for natural law is essentially a way of giving civil power a religious authority beyond the possibility of church interference by claiming them to be the dictates of god through nature de cive 6 contractualism is likewise used to secure civil authority above religious the commonwealth is just the contract between all members of the society to lay down their arms and submit to a sovereign the sovereign is just the representative of the people through this contract though the laws of nature drive people to make this contract and though these laws of nature are said to be the product of god they are ultimately just a precept or generall rule found out by reason by which a man is forbidden to do that which is destructive of his life or taketh away the means of preserving the same leviathan chap xiv 91 such laws are deduced by reason not divine instruction and as such do not necessarily require a christian or even religious dogma they should rather be seen as the essential laws for the upkeep of peace and society
   was hobbes writing leviathan  hobbes writings were a reaction to the english civil war of 1642 which forced him to flee to france where he begun writing his famous treatise the war itself was one between king charles i and the parliament which resulted in the tumult with oliver cromwell and the third civil war to reinstate the monarchy after the dust had settled 200000 people had died in england and scotland and many more in ireland during this time there was much looting and pillaging of crown and church lands and general chaos reigned at the core of this dispute was a struggle for power between the parliament and the kingthe parliament thinking that the king was going to destroy the institution of the parliament and the king thinking that the parliament was trying to destroy the institution of the king by curtailing his capacity to govern without their consent hobbes wrote a book on his analysis of the wars called behemoth or the long parliament where he outlines what he considered the major causes of the war do note that hobbes was an avowed royalist and had always worked under the aristocracy of england the most important were  the presbyterians desire for religious power  the parliaments desire for sovereign power  the opinion that england was a mixed monarchy  it is from these criticisms that we can see the roots of many of hobbes arguments most important for our topic however is the focus on the role of the presbyterians and other religious factions on propagating the war what hobbes hoped to achieve with leviathan was to amend the problems that he saw to be the cause of civil strife based on his appraisal of the war this meant affirming the absolute power of the sovereign justifying why the sovereign has power and what the citizens obligations are to them and to subordinate religion to civil powers in the realm of civil affairs in fact for this last reason hobbes was accused of being an atheist in his time even though he clearly wasnt
   on religion and the sovereign  because hobbes saw religious pretences to civil power as a primary cause of war in commonwealths he sought to essentially break the power of religious institutions in society by subordinating them to the state in his appraisal of the civil war he notes that many of the antiroyalist what he considers seditious rhetoric rose from the preachings of priests on sundays and the squabbles of university scholars as to ones obligations to god hobbes saw this as a unique problem of christianity wondering how we can have peace with this as our religion i cannot tell behemoth d1 57 having people who think their obligation is foremost to god or foremost to gods messenger in rome or foremost to someone else who claims to be his messenger or claims to have the correct interpretation is to hobbes to diminish the sovereignty of the civil power and split it between two power bases this is one of the other major causes of civil strife hobbes states again and again in all his works that man cannot serve two masters that is that the division of the sovereign power is impossible hobbes also understood that much of the power of the sovereign came in the belief of their legitimacya fact demonstrated when charles i couldnt raise much of an army against the parliament because of this power of opinion and christianitys propensity to theological conflicts hobbes saw it as necessary that the one man or council to whom sovereign power has been committed by the commonwealth also has the right both the decide which opinions and doctrines are inimical to peace and to forbid their being taught de cive vi 80 and in reference to this idea states there is virtually no dogma either in religion or the human sciences from which disagreements may not arise and from them conflicts quarrelling and eventually war this is not because the dogma is false but because of human nature  one cannot prevent such disagreements from happening however by use of sovereign power they can be kept from interfering with the public peace de cive vi 8081 hobbes concerns were never about whether the doctrines being taught were correct or not whether the theological issues were legitimate or not but rather that they must conform with the public peace the cover of leviathan gives is a demonstration of this the leviathan a representation of the sovereign wields the sword and the sceptreboth civill and ecclesiasticall powerin the assurance of peace
   law and the social contract  i stated earlier that hobbes project was to subordinate the religious powers to the civil and this is demonstrated in his two foremost arguments the idea of natural law and the idea of the social contract in the state of nature life is ugly brutish and short so generally not a pleasant state to be in because of this in the interest of his own safety the greatest urge of all men man will use his faculty of reason to discover the rules necessary as to avoid conflict these are the laws of nature and are to be followed by all when there is an opportunity to without sacrificing ones livelihood the first of these laws is that every man ought to endeavour peace as far as he can hope of obtaining it which leads to the second law that a man be willing when others are so too as farreforth as for peace and defence of himself he shall think it necessary to lay down this right to all things and be contented with so much liberty as he would allow other men against himself leviathan xiv 92 hobbes thus demonstrates that the formation of the state is founded on reason and for the purpose of security hobbes attributes natural law as divine law as reason which is the law of nature itself has been given to each and every man directly by god as a rule for his actions de cive iv 58 this isnt a new idea you can find it in aquinas work but the application is novel this is the only way that god can communicate his laws to man without the explicit use of a prophet
  the social contract is a product of the laws of nature especially the first two as such the contract that forms the foundation of a commonwealth is based on reason rather than any explicit divine mandate under hobbes definition of a contract both parties must recognise the contract for it to be valid what is important about this for our question is that this definition of a contract precludes the possibility of man making contract with god hobbes notes this in leviathan saying to make contract with god is impossible but by mediation of such as god speaketh to either be revelation supernaturall or by his lieutenants that govern under him and in his name for otherwise we know not whether our covenant be accepted or not and therefore they that vow anything contrary to any law of nature vow in vain as being a thing unjust to pay such vow and if it be a thing commanded by the law of nature it is not the vow but the law that binds them leviathan xiv 97 so what hobbes is doing here is precluding any possible religious authority claiming sovereign power one cannot claim sovereignty by right of god above the civil sovereign or claim that the civil sovereigns laws are contrary to divine laws because there cannot possibly be any contract between and individual and god and hence no laws or obligations so the laws of nature are the only way we can know gods will those laws just so happen to force the subject to respect the civil sovereign and their laws and that the sovereign authority is a product of divine law hobbes very much has the view of giving unto caesar what is caesars
   hobbes vision of the commonwealth compatible with secular society  with all that out of the way the direct question can be addressed it is very clear that hobbes conception of a commonwealth presupposes a christian society that shouldnt be surprising however i dont see how it necessitates a christian society or dogma per say the lawes of nature which are the foundation of the commonwealth are deduced by reason and while this reason is presupposed to be of divine inspiration the point of it exists beyond its originit is merely the rules necessary to peace in a society from the reference point of security i do think that the splitting of leviathan into essentially two parts the civil and religious is an intentional separation of these powers the contractualism of hobbes doesnt require a christian dogma either hobbes demonstration of his willingness to subordinate the religious powers and laws to civil power and laws i think is evidence that hobbes primary concern was simply with peace and security in a state no matter how it was achieved hobbes makes practically no reference to scripture in the first half of leviathan which is odd for the time note even the champion of secularism locke uses far more theological arguments than hobbes ever does that a commonwealth and a christian commonwealth are entirely separate parts should tell you a lot about the necessity of christian dogma to hobbes project the leviathan in the book of job is the ruler over the children of pride and there is no power on earth that compares with him which is exactly what hobbes conceived the state to beabove to possibility of challenge on earth
  that said there is a single paragraph that would suggest otherwise the idea only appears once in de cive is completely absent from leviathan and behemoth but does make a lot of sense in hobbes systematic thinking   now what we call the laws of nature are nothing other than certain conclusions understood by reason on what is to be done and not to be done and a law properly and precisely speaking is an utterance by one who by right commands other to do or not to do hence properly speaking the natural laws are not laws in so far as they proceed from nature but in so far as the same laws have been legislated by god in the holy scriptures as we shall see in the next chapter they are properly called by the name of laws for holy scripture is the utterance of god who issues commands in all things with the highest right de cive iii 5657  so this would imply that hobbes laws of nature are only valid as laws within a christian cosmology but it wouldnt prevent a secular commonwealth being formed according to the rules of nature as long as there is a christian god im not sure if that counts as an overt christian dogma underpinning it interpret it as you will    annnnd thats it
  your opinion is worth less than nothing  seek psychiatric help  learn proper english  begone thot
  thanks ill read it tomorrow maybe
  copypastad this into txt to read later should i put a name to this i will read through and maybe write a refutation/rebuttal to thjs work in my own time
  so epic
parts one and two of leviathan was pretty good but this third part is kinda dryi think his knowledge of the bible is amazing and every now and then he says something that i never learned in sunday school/confirmation
  i think this is a poor reading of leviathan as its too straightfaced the leviathan is meant to evoke horror and the sense of alien it is fundamentally a work underpinned by esoterics despite his constant appeal to reason
  i have no intention of tripfagging so just put anon i also dont have access to my copies of hobbes at the moment and wont for at least a month so any reply to the rebuttal will have to wait at least that long
  started it stopped because it was garbage
  a thersites appears and gets swiftly put in his place by an odysseus
  i dont think so hobbes was fascinated with geometry and wanted to make politics a science in the same vein this is why he begins leviathan with an outline of human nature as very mechanistic and determined hes setting up constants on which he can build his science of the state while i do think that leviathan for lack of a better word was propaganda to prevent further civil strife i dont think it is esoteric at all
juj
  nope
  not only did i disagree with hobbes conclusions  i also diasgree with his premises his whole philosophy stands and falls with the bad nature of human beings which is debatable
no i only read relevant literature try zizek

yeah i read it all now what
  no    based
  isnt this a goodreads review
  yeah
  nothing is able to be discussed if we dont take some predispositions as true otherwise discussions breakdown into meaningless debates over the definitions of common phrases and words accept the premise for a assuming that this is the case and go from there stop being pedantic
so for hobbes the natural laws arise from reason reason as a divine faculty aparently i always tought it was emotional factors like empathy that prompted the laws
  sorry i dont read satanic shit

  the first two books i can appreciatte the effort it took him to come up with all of that shit but his reasoning is literally fedora tier on so many levels its almost infuriating
  i think his reasoning is soundlook at what happened when achilles challenged agamemnons sovereignty or all the revolts and rebellions in history and the constant deposing of emperors in romelike hobbes said its often best to just weather the storm when a mad king comes into power then to civil war
  his reasoning is a mathematical equation pure abstraction

  that book looks like it would be fuckin awesome
  fuckin awesome  leave
  nestor the prince of pylos with all sincerity and goodwill addressed them thus my friends said he princes and councillors of the argives if any other man of the achaeans had told us of this dream we should have declared it false and would have had nothing to do with it but he who has seen it is the foremost man among us we must therefore set about getting the people under arms     iliad scroll 2    3000 years ago based nestor knew to listen to his king even if was just a flimsy dream    odysseus also speaks in scroll 2     we cannot all be kings it is not well that there should be many masters one man must be supreme one king to whom the son of scheming saturn has given the sceptre of sovereignty over you all
  hobbes reasoning is the same as based nestors and odysseushobbes even translated iliad into english
    hobbes leviathan is basically we must have a king  wow what a way to prove that you actually didnt read the book
  lets outline some of the remarks made in the book  you cannot have any sort of conflicting powers balancing is retarded because it will always inevitably devolve into both powers blocking themselves and nothing will work  you cannot break any contract because if you break a contract then everyone will and society will be chaos  there cannot be free expression because people are stupid and malevolent and word is poison so any society with free speech is doomed to chaos
  its literally a mathematical argument have you read the book he actually tries to emulate aristotle while insulting him and he starts to describe feelings and concepts as additions of other things it is full blown autism of the boring kind
  and lets not even get started on the concept of human emotion as impulses that flow through the body unless something stops them for the love of god what horeseshit
        all one btw just sperged i dislike that book so much
  it is full blown autism to just sperg like that
  fuckin idiot lmao
  thersites is the true hero of the iliad you stupid fuck
   cannot have any sort of conflicting powers balancing is retarded because it will always inevitably devolve into both powers blocking themselves and nothing will work    this is why rome would put a dictator in charge to deal with conflicting powers
  congress will delay the government shutdown deadline by about two weeks after the death of president george hw bush  lawmakers plan to extend funding through dec 21  disagreements over whether to fund president donald trumps proposed border wall had raised the prospect of a government shutdown
your initial reaction to this book yields more insight than any personality test or psych eval ever could
  no and why the fricking heck would i
  there cannot be free expression because people are stupid and malevolent and word is poison     check your glib tongue thersites said be and babble not a word further chide not with princes when you have none to back you there is no viler creature come before troy with the sons of atreus drop this chatter about kings and neither revile them nor keep harping about going home we do not yet know how things are going to be nor whether the achaeans are to return with good success or evil how dare you gibe at agamemnon because the danaans have awarded him so many prizes i tell you therefore and it shall surely be that if i again catch you talking such nonsense i will either forfeit my own head and be no more called father of telemachus or i will take you strip you stark naked and whip you out of the assembly till you go blubbering back to the ships
  did you read what hobbes says he doesnt say that there is a possibility that powers enter in conflict he doesnt say that we need a safeguard against that he literally says that there is no way that a checks system can operate because it will block itself automatically it is presented as an equation since people do things to their advantage then a congress cannot work what kind of logic is that    how about presenting an argument or should i repond pompously citing what plato had to say about homer and the poets
  plato had a lot to say about free expression people are stupid and word is poison
  yes and also about making your own arguments instead of trying to present stuff via proxy
  plato loved homer even though he spoke of censoring iti get a chuckle when he says that athena would never tell pandarus to shoot menelaus
  also the outline of hobbess argument of free speech is  emotions feelings whatevers are impulses that move through your body  since they have inertia you can only stop them by opposing force  that is the basis to say that something akin to human beings are uncontrollable beasts so then it goes  people are stupid  tricks of speech convince people  people use tricks of speech to bring wrongthink  people will inevitable be corrupted by that  society will go to shit because of that    it is a pure abstraction literally logos of the worst kind
  my keyboard is fucked up so im using on screen keyboard so im not being as articulate as i should be
  ill check the thread tomorrow    tsudaca
   are stupid   of speech convince people   use tricks of speech    all true
hobbes sums up the second part with i recover some hope that one time or other this writing of mine may fall into the hands of a soveraign who will consider it himselfe for it is short and i think clear without the help of any interested or envious interpreter and by the exercise of entire soveraignty in protecting the publique teaching of it convert this truth of speculation into the utility of practice     so yeah an abstraction but i liked this booki learned a lot from it and a lot of it is based as fuck and deals in reality
  nice i enjoyed that and may even read leviathan now thanks anon

  this
    i dont want to write an essay but finishing decline of the west a few weeks ago got me thinking about hamlet now shakespeare sets up fortinbras as the foil to hamlet  that much is clear but this really shows us the heart of western drama that is character drama think what wouldve happened if fortinbras had been the prince of denmark  he was no hamlet the tragedy is caused by who hamlet is not by a unfortunate incident now think to aeschylus  was there anything about who orestes was that couldve changed his position no it was random misfortune which is why the viewer is sympathetic to him for hamlet however the audience feels compassion anyway this is just one of the things that makes this play so great

    job is selfish in only considering the relation between god and suffering when he himself becomes afflicted it is implied that god could have destroyed everyone and everything around him and job would have thought nothing of it jobs conclusion or lack thereof being as strange as gods explanation or lack thereof the story reveals the idea of ironic divine punishment warning that the absolute is good and the particular is bad as earnest henotic empathy warning that the particular unknowingly is the absolute and that it would have an awful experience were it to see itself reflected as such in this case god perfectly mirroring jobs casual selfishness

the french revolution was an event in which urban intellectuals jealous of the aristocracy used the masses to grasp control they govern society with theory instead of principle substitute quantity for quality just as the military need well trained leadership so does society irreligious rational materialistic men sterilize everything by analyzing it including themselves children are considered in terms of pros and cons art architecture clothing furniture music lose their form becoming ever changing popular fads    lacking discipline to reform themselves intellectual world improvers constantly propose theories on how to govern society all forms of social distinction good manners honor authority rank are ceaselessly attacked and deconstructed this process will continue until the idea exhausts itself nihilism and chaos     destiny has put us in this era of decay we can face our fate with courage or be cowardly optimists     every culture has gone through its own form of nihilism and skepsis where skeptics question everything how long then does a culture survive after a certain number of generations each culture transforms into civilization what was formerly alive becomes rigid and cold expansiveness of mind and spirit is replaced with a lust for expansion in the material world life guided by ideals is replaced by life guided by politics and economics the power of these ideas becomes strong so much that it leads to imperialism a sign of transformation is a socrates buddha lao tsu rousseau they enunciate ultimate but earthly ideals with practical and terminal ideas the materialistic ideas of mass and number begin to dominate the culture governments try to appeal to the most plebeian catchwords are used equality the common good the working man    in this era of transition a man like alexander the great emerges for the west it is napoleon his immense military success is due to ignoring chivalric military traditions materialist thought guides military strategy technology and mass are used to win armies shrink in size soon after into voluntary professional armies most join for money or love of combat armies gradually become privatized pacifism becomes popular in reaction society becomes increasingly litigious money is an idea which slowly becomes more abstract until it itself becomes a power it buys state power and over time the lines separating politics and commerce slowly fade away business and government combine forming an imperial government     there are men who desire power who cannot be stopped

spengler magian civilisation died in 1258 the west is coming to its natural end  spengler fans we must save the west from the muslamic invaders
yep it seems like strawmen and copes make you guys sleep at night
armchair historianno serious archival researchhe should have stuck to being a high school teacher
  thats a rather uncharitable assessment more like the zeitgeist is moving us as puppets to ensure enough of the european race survives the cataclysmic race war that will end this dark age to begin a new golden age for our species if our race fails humans will revert to pure savagery
  spenglers work is an attempt on making a theory of everything so that the potential right reader would have a compass to go to the right direction  the work of historians is worth nothing will get forgotten in only 100 years
  kys spaft
  spengler fans  protect our race through the winter of our civilization and behold us of the doom are current ideals will lead us to so there might be the slim chance that the created globohomo might fall one day and that new culture can be born and the cycle can renew itself
  where can you go with spengler other than seppuku and maybe islam the latter isnt reasonable in this day and age as the arabs are completely faustian at this point
  spengler was not an academic historian he was a social and cultural theorist and one of the most important and by far one of the most influential thinkers of the interwar period his doctoral work was in philosophy not history and high prussian historicism in the fin de siecle period was more of an exclusive guild than ever he never made any claims to being an historiker in the prestigious and disciplinary sense that the german historicist tradition invented     decline of the west is one of the most important works of the 20th century revival in goethe studies and as i said one of the most influential publications of the period by far read by everybody in every social class and by every luminary and thinker of the period from wittgenstein to heidegger in the germanspeaking countries to a similar roster abroad as well     also being a high school teacher in germany was fairly prestigious and anglos are often misled by the differences between the english and german institutions after the prussian reforms of the nineteenth century the abitur was required to attend university and only doctors could teach gymnasium high school students
  why are you so hostile  my i ask you what are your dreams and passtimes
  incorrect anyone thats actually spenglerian knows that islam does not even exist
  as he said the choice is not between this and that  the choice is between doing what is necessary and fulfilling your creative needs with the early winter possibilities engineering war politics business crime etc or do nothing doing art now is burying your head under the sand as is the same as doing nothing
  we are born into this time and must bravely follow the path to the destined end there is no other way our duty is to hold on to the lost position without hope without rescue like that roman soldier whose bones were found in front of a door in pompeii who during the eruption of vesuvius died at his post because they forgot to relieve him that is greatness that is what it means to be a thoroughbred the honorable end is the one thing that can not be taken from a man
  more importantly even if the struggle against the wests demise is indeed fruitless and said demise inevitable the good and noble men will fight all the harder for it and perish with clear consciences that is what it means to be a thoroughbred
  and fulfilling your creative needs with the early winter possibilities engineering war politics business crime etc    what do you mean

acknowledge hes the goat right now
hes better than goats
hes no spenser
  ill kill you
  no he perfected spenser
  bumping for the goat
  my wife argues that since most scholars have little recourse but to imbue his works with meaning derived from his biography milton is not quite the goat shakespeare for all we know was either a pseudonym for a nobleman or else was a petty moneygrubbing swindler the most we can know about homer is that he was allegedly blind what can we say about cervantes other than he was a wounded soldier    contrastingly lycidas although a rich dense metaphysical poem is singularly viewed as a straight allegory for miltons time at cambridge  no less a figure than dr johnson read it as such miltons works cant escape the orbit of his personhood and he cannot be said to be the goat
  why did pound hate milton was he just jealous
  this is a terrible argument desu but i hope my wife is as based
  yeah it seems like if you follow the logic of the argument the writer we know the most about is the worst
  tfw dfw
  are you saying a goat writer must be in most regards an anonymous figure little more than a name and a basic history
  yeah her theory doesnt account for dante who we know a fair bit about not as much as milton but enough and is often considered the goat
  pound was a virulent antisemite and milton wrote a poem that glorified and strengthened hebrew scripture do the math
      my drunkenly related point is that most milton scholars have no choice but to read the authors biography in his work the reference to dr johnson was to show how a man of great critical talent and one who also knew the worth of biographies fell into the same trap with milton while there are some dante scholars who can do nothing but write  muh beatrice  they pale in comparison to people who can discuss the text independently of dantes life sure its worth noting that dante wrote some of his friends in hell just like milton wrote king in heaven or whateverthefuck still milton stands as a figure of political and religious importance and its hard to divorce that from his writing      no but i do believe that the works of a goat writer should lend themselves to many different interpretations anonymity makes it a helluva lot easier
  this is still a weak argument just because the state of a writers scholarship is weak doesnt make the writer weak go to bed alchie
  alright lets draw blood milton wrote glorified fanfiction that was only lauded because it was the first literaryreligious accomplishment of the anticatholic british he being a contemptuous whig sowed morally corrupt seeds in his literature which sprouted as widespread acceptance of divorce arianism and republicanism
  miltons style is too synthetic and stiff for him to be the goat reading shakespeare after reading milton is like taking in a big breath of fresh air after being stuck in a musty old church

    you can write better right /lit/  show your best erotic writing in this thread
erotic writing isnt /lit/  renounce the flesh
erotic writing  better  implying it can achieve goodness    its literally endless euphemistic descriptions used to compose a work that seeks to do anything but serve the purpose of employing euphemisms     the only use that describing sex can have is to discuss the subject in general unfortunately most all erotic fiction is focused on describing the experience instead of what it means which is retarded because porn is equally braindead but threefold more entertaining
  he moved in long stiff sweeps sliding in and out his scrotum flopping into the cleft of her ass at the end of each stroke his skin was so sensitive that her ass hairs seemed to etch their curled shapes on his scrotum and her pubic muff larger than the hair nest from which his cock sprouted mashed silkenly at his naked groin her broad plump mound formed a cushion that dwarfed lilys and the hot orbs of her tits made the girls seem like oranges but the greatest thrill was more than the maturity of her physique the soft round arms about his shoulders the lusty thighs cradling him the hamlike buttocks he pressed against the best was the liquid violence of her lust the way her indrawing squishy cunt expressed the hungers of her entire body    he wanted to tell her that but if he spoke he would be distracted by one of a hundred other sensual impressions the stiff rubberiness of her tit knobs the strongly female odor of her armpits the softness of her cheek as he rubbed his chin on it he thus held his tongue and shortly paused in fucking her to study individually these exquisite sensations

  how is your opinion on an intergender relationship/breeding
  im going to be straight here i am a cuckold but i am also a white nationalist i believe that whites have contributed more to humanity than any other race space travel antibiotics the list goes on but when it comes down to it blacks are just better at fucking theres no shame in admitting this there is no shame in admitting that despite the infinite intellectual and moral superiority of the white race black cock is just better at pleasing women    the reason white women are turning from the cause and running to niggers is simply because they are not being sexually satisfied can you blame them if you dont get enough to eat at home youre going to go out to eat the only way to save the white race from miscegenation is cuckolding my pure white wife is my angel the apple of my eye and i want nothing but the best for her so every friday she gets to have her fill of big black cock and our relationship goes on like normal we love each other and plan on having a child soon she also shares my red pilled beliefs    monogamy is a tool of the jew just give it a chance once its exhilarating theres something deeply majestic about watching a toned muscular black stud going in and out of a beautiful white woman try it once
  i think that the proper orientation of the human will is towards nonexistence thus breeding is something to be avoided as is relationships with women which naturally tend towards procreation so the best choice for a man is to pursue relationships with other men which naturally tend towards extinction
i think that the proper orientation of the human will is towards nonexistence thus breeding is something to be avoided as is relationships with women which naturally tend towards procreation so the best choice for a man is to pursue relationships with other men which naturally tend towards extinction
  dont you cringe at me frog
  you sound like a redditor
  based reddit hunter
  we all    speak for yourself incel
  your premise is trash you say that the human will is oriented towards nonexistence so people should stop breeding if the human will truly was oriented towards nonexistence people would stop breeding on their own
  i said thats the proper orientation meaning that i think thats how people should orient themselves not that thats how they are already oriented
  haha ok femoid
  oh then youre just a rankandfile antinatalist antinatlism is an indefensible position a true antinatalist would kill himself if he truly thought human suffering was bad enough to justify not procreating an antinatalist who refuses to is no antinatalist at all

  every time you talk to a woman in private
  yawn i never said anything about human suffering or my reasoning even if that were the basis of my view your objection is the most facile one imaginable
  10/10 would laugh at again
stop replying to this thread please if you have to reply use sage in the options bar so you dont bump it
  why else would you say that people should orient themselves towards nonexistence and theres nothing facile about it at all its a logical contradiction if you believe that future humans should not exist because current human suffering is so great that it would be worthwhile to save future humans from that suffering then logically current humans should not exist either an antinatalists who does not commit suicide either 1 is not truly an antinatalist or 2 lacks the fortitude to carry out his own preachings and should be ignored but really 2 could be rolled into 1 as anyone who lacks the will to follow through is not a true believer in the first place
  i would but when you put sage in the option bar it automatically sends ligma to your device
  the objection is facile because  1 it doesnt say anything about antinatalism rather it attempts to point out supposed hypocrisy in the antinatalist a follower of a position being flawed does not discount the position  2 there are antinatalists who do kill themselves rendering your argument entirely invalid see pic it is also possible that any given antinatalist will kill themselves in the future you have no way to know  3 antinatalism does not necessitate suicide and also is not necessarily based upon an argument from suffering but im not going to attempt to explain any of this to someone as imbecilic as yourself ive done enough to demonstrate that your trite gotcha argument is wrong
    use sage
  i told you when you do that it can make your browsing device susceptible to ligma and/or bofa
    kill yourself
i thought it was something to do with them being on a power trip

  theres a great section from don quixote you all should read marcelas defense    1/3    i come not ambrosia for any of the purposes thou hast named replied marcela but to defend myself and to prove how unreasonable are all those who blame me for their sorrow and for chrysostoms death and therefore i ask all of you that are here to give me your attention for will not take much time or many words to bring the truth home to persons of sense heaven has made me so you say beautiful and so much so that in spite of yourselves my beauty leads you to love me and for the love you show me you say and even urge that i am bound to love you by that natural understanding which god has given me i know that everything beautiful attracts love but i cannot see how by reason of being loved that which is loved for its beauty is bound to love that which loves it besides it may happen that the lover of that which is beautiful may be ugly and ugliness being detestable it is very absurd to say i love thee because thou art beautiful thou must love me though i be ugly but supposing the beauty equal on both sides it does not follow that the inclinations must be therefore alike for it is not every beauty that excites love some but pleasing the eye without winning the affection and if every sort of beauty excited love and won the heart the will would wander vaguely to and fro unable to make choice of any for as there is an infinity of beautiful objects there must be an infinity of inclinations and true love i have heard it said is indivisible and must be voluntary and not compelled if this be so as i believe it to be why do you desire me to bend my will by force for no other reason but that you say you love me naytell mehad heaven made me ugly as it has made me beautiful could i with justice complain of you for not loving me moreover you must remember that the beauty i possess was no choice of mine for be it what it may heaven of its bounty gave it me without my asking or choosing it and as the viper though it kills with it does not deserve to be blamed for the poison it carries as it is a gift of nature neither do i deserve reproach for being beautiful for beauty in a modest woman is like fire at a distance or a sharp sword the one does not burn the other does not cut those who do not come too near honour and virtue are the ornaments of the mind without which the body though it be so has no right to pass for beautiful but if modesty is one of the virtues that specially lend a grace and charm to mind and body why should she who is loved for her beauty part with it to gratify one who for his pleasure alone strives with all his might and energy to rob her of it
  2/3     i was born free and that i might live in freedom i chose the solitude of the fields in the trees of the mountains i find society the clear waters of the brooks are my mirrors and to the trees and waters i make known my thoughts and charms i am a fire afar off a sword laid aside those whom i have inspired with love by letting them see me i have by words undeceived and if their longings live on hopeand i have given none to chrysostom or to any otherit cannot justly be said that the death of any is my doing for it was rather his own obstinacy than my cruelty that killed him and if it be made a charge against me that his wishes were honourable and that therefore i was bound to yield to them i answer that when on this very spot where now his grave is made he declared to me his purity of purpose i told him that mine was to live in perpetual solitude and that the earth alone should enjoy the fruits of my retirement and the spoils of my beauty and if after this open avowal he chose to persist against hope and steer against the wind what wonder is it that he should sink in the depths of his infatuation if i had encouraged him i should be false if i had gratified him i should have acted against my own better resolution and purpose he was persistent in spite of warning he despaired without being hated bethink you now if it be reasonable that his suffering should be laid to my charge let him who has been deceived complain let him give way to despair whose encouraged hopes have proved vain let him flatter himself whom i shall entice let him boast whom i shall receive but let not him call me cruel or homicide to whom i make no promise upon whom i practise no deception whom i neither entice nor receive it has not been so far the will of heaven that i should love by fate and to expect me to love by choice is idle let this general declaration serve for each of my suitors on his own account and let it be understood from this time forth that if anyone dies for me it is not of jealousy or misery he dies for she who loves no one can give no cause for jealousy to any and candour is not to be confounded with scorn let him who calls me wild beast and basilisk leave me alone as something noxious and evil let him who calls me ungrateful withhold his service who calls me wayward seek not my acquaintance who calls me cruel pursue me not for this wild beast this basilisk this ungrateful cruel wayward being has no kind of desire to seek serve know or follow them if chrysostoms impatience and violent passion killed him why should my modest behaviour and circumspection be blamed if i preserve my purity in the society of the trees why should he who would have me preserve it among men seek to rob me of it
  i get the exact opposite impression  women are on average significantly more redpilled than their male counterparts theyve been solicited for sex on a near daily basis and had any romantic delusions about human nature taken from them by the time they were teenagers  the thing about women though is that they will never share the redpill with anyone they keep it for themselves because their only power in this world is memeing men to do their bidding  but when im talking to a woman and i look into her eyes i see all the psychopathic redpill shit in her soul women are of the earth men are of the sky
  3/3    once i really am in power my first and foremost task will be the annihilation of the jews as soon as i have the power to do so i will have gallows built in rowsat the marienplatz in munich for exampleas many as traffic allows then the jews will be hanged indiscriminately and they will remain hanging until they stink they will hang there as long as the principles of hygiene permit as soon as they have been untied the next batch will be strung up and so on down the line until the last jew in munich has been exterminated other cities will follow suit precisely in this fashion until all germany has been completely cleansed of jews
  3/3    i have as you know wealth of my own and i covet not that of others my taste is for freedom and i have no relish for constraint i neither love nor hate anyone i do not deceive this one or court that or trifle with one or play with another the modest converse of the shepherd girls of these hamlets and the care of my goats are my recreations my desires are bounded by these mountains and if they ever wander hence it is to contemplate the beauty of the heavens steps by which the soul travels to its primeval abode

  hart crane     of course what youre really looking for is psychedelics
  hart crane  i will check him out havent read poetry in awhile  psychedelics  if i cant get there without drugs it isnt a real experience id rather find it myself than settle for a pale imitation

  boulanger  not that anon but its pretty well established in the art music world that the boulanger sisters were masters lilis sister nadia went on to mentor quite a few more famous composers such as aaron copland and phillip glass
  pale imitation  huehue i wish to meet a man who could frankly describe a respectable dose of lsd as pale  real experience  misconceptions of real and experience is satiation a real experience only when found from within  find it in myself  excluding yourself altogether from psychedelics on a path to find what was stated in your op baffles me not because i think you should take them but because you think that they are some shortcut or corrupter the experience youre speaking of exists outside of psychedelics but is no more real or earned without them i dont see sufficient reason in your admittedly short offthecuff arguments to abstain/demean psychedelics and id like to hear why you hold these views against them
  a philosophical enquiry into the origin of our ideas of the sublime and beautiful  this looks very intriguing going to check it out read everything else you recommended and those were great    based

70 of lit students are female  50 of all books sold are romance  romance is the biggest genre in literature  9 of 10 first novels that become a hit are written by females  harry potter was written by a female  stephen king writes in a female style of common daily language  all best sellers are about daily life issues of normal people female topics  male fiction sells less than female centered fiction
/lit/ is a female board
being this intimidated by women  see literature sucks to discuss with other men because its either betas with no interesting ideas or betas who just whine about women is there anyone in this board who isnt an insane beta
  if you want to do alpha shit go play ball or join the military or learn math  but you wont because youre not actually alpha just a projecting beta white knight
  read manly authors like balzac and celine and throw the effeminate neocon aesthetes like nabokov into the trashread equal parts nonfiction and fiction and learn another language
  why exactly does any of this matter who actually gives a shit if youre seriously taking buyer statistics into account while reading you might actually be retarded
  what are you surprised about most of the posters on /lit/ are females just like /ck/
more like lit is a cultural luxury literature as a hobby is incompatible with frenzied pace of modern life literature is painfully slow and demands too much most men choose more important things to pursue in life like a career or education and when it comes to relaxation they choose quicker simpler forms of entertainment like videogames or tv shows women are hedonistic by their very nature theyre not smart enough to aspire for greater things so for them literature is not a compromise but a way to actualize their decadent cry for attention
  is there anyone in this board who isnt an insane beta    me in real life though most of the people i know who are interested in literaturewith the exception of my best friendare women and effeminate men the men i know who are interested in things such as shooting weight lifting and flying airplanes are not generally that interested in books oh well sometimes its more fun to do activities than read about them
why do you think the art form is dead
  i stick my dick in it
fiction sucks novels are trash its all written for twodigit iq zimbos whats described in all but a handful of the very best works cannot possibly be called sapience its hardly even sentience    all best sellers are about daily life issues of normal people female topics  this is the heart of it 99 of the content of any randomly selected novel can only provoke the reaction of who gives a flying fuck  who the fuck would want to read the minute painfully quotidian details of some dimwit nobody as imagined by some other dimwit nobody
  im the one with the log
  im the hamster wheel
  the funny thing is that it doesnt translate into anything   male participants can develop criteria to keep females out of their world   the end result is you can become even more sexist than before participating the thing
  can i pet it
  most of the posters on /lit/ are woman  lol ok trap tits or gtfo
  lol this is a funny image ill have to show it to my grandchildren )))
  then where is my /lit/ female gf
  women are more literate than men these days so that should be expected i know its trendy to malign women on 4channel because they dont give you the attention you crave but the average man is a complete idiot

  youre thinking if 4chan 4channel is a female webzone
  reading shit books is worse than reading nothing at all they would be better off smoking weed and playing videogames
  actually this is true despite e/lit/ists being oblivious to this fact if you ask people here to post their accounts of goodreads or something like that youll see far many more females
  smoking weed and playing vidya is always the worst choice
  tfw i have probably replied to my soulmate once upon a time and neither of us knew it

people on this board are so vain that they posture over books they pretend to have read anonymously thats right they are trying to signal social standing with posts that can never be connected to any other one they post or them as a personthe only person they could possibly be posturing to is themselves every single thread on a book will include a greentext of the book name attached with a disgusted looking harold bloom who they of course havent read thats how people argue here they just post a smug ohh i cant believe youd read something like that or snicker you actually think that with no context im convinced that no one has actually read a book on this board theyve just memorized names and faces and vague ideas associated with them and just bounce the same baseless conceptions back and forth between each other until it forms a board wide gestalt consciousness of pseud like someone here could show you the most obscure portrait of kant looking like a negrogoblin a wacky anecdote about coffee or his masturbation habits but ask them anything about his actual philosophy and you will get total silence ask about an entrylevel book total silence ask about a basic grammar concept total silence ask which author had the biggest forehead 100 replies with the most bitter arguments imaginable how anybody could think this place the last bastion of literary culture is unimaginable this board is the theoretical zeropoint of intelligent discussion on the internet

  what is interesting that i have noticed is that even in fields where the majority of people in it are female youll find that at least 80 of the successful in that field are men
  second to last point even applies to most male fiction as well literature is profoundly effeminate and always will be philosophy is just the anima that possesses the literary talent in drag and the poet makes no pretensions to being anything other than the receptive slave of elemental and cosmic power destiny and power elude all of them what destiny does a writer have other than to elucidate and document on behalf of their muses their dreams friends culture gods and superiors

females are nothing but parasites devoid of original thought and creative drive they hoist themselves on the monuments built by men and claim its ours just look at videogames  once the social stigma of vidya is for fucking nerds was gone all of a sudden the same women who mocked the nerds turned into suchanerds but theres no sincerity because its just an imitation there are no female speedrunners or female progamers no modders or rommakers women do not truly love videogames to buy the hobby selfselessy wholesale same with literature only its even worse  after observing men women had plagued the field of what they perceive to be a prestigious activity and made it into a show because everything has to be a show with women ourward extraverted women are responsible for booktubers women are the ones obsessed with majoring in liberal arts so they can be professionally good readers men men simply read books they arent posting shelfies with the latest book haul or screeching about the misogyny in some classical novel online they just read noble inwardbynature men enjoy literature for what it is quietly and without making it a banner for their identity this disbalance of goals creates an illusion of a femaledominated field when a minority of loud shallow husks scream in a room devised for solitary meditation

theres a new pledge going round and its a pledge that ive taken    ive signed to it and sworn to it    its the pledge to read zero 0 novels in 2019 /nonovel19/ i do solemnly swear never to give into gutenbergian temptation always to uphold the virtue and honour of my dramatic and lyrical heritage and mostly to read verse i will never get lost in the shapeless ramblings of a nvelist    what is this gay shit  like most people here most of what read is in the form of nvels some are indisputably great however nvels are the easiest literary form to consume and as a result i have severely neglected poetry and drama which is stunning considering how young the nvel is as a form so as an experiment im planning to read only poetry plays and classical philosophy in 2019 and i wanted to post here to see if anyone else is interested    why would we be  curiosity but of course there is more to it than that i suspect that many people here feel like me that the ease of reading novels has led to a laziness in exploring other literary forms just think that there was once a time before novels when confrontation with a written narrative was an inherently slow and difficult experience and thus more highly valued there was also a time when the reading of nvels was shameful with people looking down on them the way that people now look down on consuming tv or social media because with each more instantly gratifying method of consuming a narrative more difficult modes of narrative become less and less accessible 18th and 19th century hysteria about nvels is usually seen as silly and puritanical now but just how wrong were they    uh completely wrong man ive read ulysees the infinite rainbow the list goes on and they werent easy to read  im not going to dispute that nor am i going to dispute that there are as many classic nvels as there are classic plays and poems but are you seriously suggesting that you experience reading poetry the same way that a literate person living before the mainstreaming of nvels did i bet like me when you read a poem your method is to try to read it like a book at a fast sequential reading pace trying to extract a plot and since you cant do that very effectively with most poems you get bored and stop reading them pretty soon    nno i dont bbut would stopping reading novels really help with that  idk i really dont but im willing to take a year of nvelreading out of my life to see if it makes any difference maybe it wont it wouldnt be much of an experiment if i knew what was going to happen but maybe immersion in a prenvel literary environment will have some effect on my reading habits maybe ill start paying more attention to language maybe ill be less impatient while reading or maybe ill pussy out and play with my phone because im too far gone but its only a year    anybody else interested
  nice try rupi
  what the fuck did you just call me
  originally i thought this was a troll but im actually somewhat interested although i dont really read novels desu     pretty much exclusively read  1 philosophy   2 game theory  political economy  3 biography/histories  4 psych books    i got memed into reading faust from here though and i loved it so i feel like i need to get more acquainted with verse  how are you planning to into poetry and drama
  i dont really have a sequential plan besides just pursuing my interests ive sort of played with the idea that as a further way of making the reading process slower and more difficult i might try to learn a part for each play i read and memorise a characters lines which would limit me to probably only reading three or four plays in the year but im okay with that thinking of focusing on shakespeares comedies    as for poetry im probably going to just work through the poets whose works i own editions of meaning most of the romantic poets and gerard manley hopkins i imagine if enough people were interested in this it would show in there being a fair amount of reading groups for different poets etc id be happy to do a shelley or a keats one because i actually kind of know their main works    basically the main idea is immersion reading poetry cultivates a very different set of reading habits than reading novels and id like to see for myself whether reading primarily poetry for an extended period of time has any significant effect on how i read basically itd be nice to develop more of an appreciation for language in itself rather than as an instrument for expressing information
  i wont do it but it sounds like a really interesting idea wish you luck
  ty friend
    sorry perhaps im a pleb because ive done this accidentally since i rarely read fiction anyway some dostoyevsky bee and houllebecq every now and then along with a little pessoa thrown in but what exactly is the point of this    im not sure what youre trying to get at with this appreciation of language bit have you read any philosophy of language i tend to approach things from an overly analytical perspective ie autismo so i usually devalue the phenomenological aspect of certain activities but it seems like from a purely decisiontheoretic perspective what youre doing is incredibly suboptimal     going through 4 plays and the works of a handful of poets in a year as opposed to the usual 3070 books depending on difficulty one could get through normally with a somewhat rigorous reading schedule seems like leaving a lot of room for personal intellectual development on the table    i realize this is precisely the attitude that you seem to be rebelling against the optimization of learning i suppose but do you really think this is the type of thing that can truly be escaped    i think back on the philosophy and social theory ive read in the past year and it has changed the way i look at the world yet ive only scratched the surface  spending a year reading a small handful of plays and poetry seems almost overly indulgent  although id probably say the same thing about a fair amount of novels as well    inb4 ur autistic    perhaps but this is also the society we live in now  no escaping the omnipresent optimization processes  the only way out is through    not to withdraw from the process but to go further to accelerate the process as nietzsche put it in this matter the truth is that we havent seen anything yet
im intrigued have a bump op
  sure i get what you mean i just think that informationconveyance is just one aspect of literature even in novels which are optimised in order to convey as much information as possible     particularly if youre a writer im not a writer in any serious sense but i do want to improve my ability to express my thoughts in interesting and eyecatching ways the microlevel decisions which are ordinarily unconscious when writing such as word choice rhythm sentence structure are important the really great writers pay enormous attention to the macrolevel decisions regarding plot character etc but equally great attention to the microlevel decisions i just mentioned similarly good readers of literature can shift between critically assessing both of these micro and macrolevel decisions and the relationship between them however since novels and most nonfiction privilege these macrolevel decisions most readers of novels have deficient critical faculties for interpreting why an author or poet made certain rhetorical decisions regarding their language use since poetry privileges the microlevel decisions this leaves most novelreaders without the faculties necessary to digest poetry in any significant way they might be able to point out aspects of a poets language choice that affects them in some way but rarely will they be able to analyse what this effect is or what the poet has done to cause it    and how do you develop the necessary faculties for interpreting these microlevel decisions theres no other way than to shift your attention when reading towards these decisions and try to notice patterns of when certain rhetorical devices are used and from that try to theorise why they have been used    its interesting that you should mention analytic philosophy of language while im not as down on analytics as most people on /lit/ i study philosophy in an analytic department ive never seen an analytic attempt to capture why some sentences have rhetorical power and some dont and further why some situations grant certain sentences rhetorical power which they lack in other contexts its important to study sentences qua propositions but its also important to study sentences qua sentences as something which has meaning over and above its propositional content and its honestly a shame that analytics get so bogged down in questions about meaning when its just one part of how we use language especially written language    i get that doing this experiment might deprive me of learning on a macrolevel but i think that developing skill in close reading can yield very different forms of learning which are equally valuable    thats a kind of weird way to put some of what im trying to say but hopefully it makes a little bit of sense
  i read all that shit in sam hydes voice
  read  plays  plays arent supposed to be read theyre supposed to be watched its like reading film scripts
  then whyd they write them down smartfag
  for theater productions and actors
  if all the worlds a stage then were all theatre producers and actors
  i actually fully understand what youre getting at and i appreciate the thoughtful reply    i suppose i read in order to improve my ability to create accurate mental models of the world and evoke change within my own life  since i am not a writer i have no need to improve my written rhetoric to the extent that i do write ie memos technical manuals articles the most important qualities are logic precision and clarity and as such reading analytic philosophy provides me with enough practice in that regard    however for your situation you want to improve the rhetorical appeal of your written work it makes perfect sense for you to dedicate the time to studying the specifics of as you say it sentences qua sentences     while i dont think itd be fruitful for me to dedicate an entire year to this pursuit id hit the point of diminishing returns far before that imo youve convinced me to at least seriously read more shakespeare and perhaps some poetry as well
not reading books youre resigning yourself to a fate of that like the negro shame sir shame
does eugene onegin count if its a novel written in prose been meaning to get that and a couple phil books off the backburner
  novel in verse    yeah id say it would count
    as in id say it would count as something you could still read i mean its verse realised my first post wasnt clear    but i mean its quite a vague rule and theres scope for people to interpret it individually if they wanted to
  well im glad my post made enough sense for you to get something out of it and i understand that an experiment like the one im planning to do is only useful for a certain kind of person who wants to develop a certain set of skills its kind of an extreme decision    you can definitely glean a lot of rhetorical skill from immersing yourself in analytic philosophy studying philosophy in an analytic department has done wonders for my ability to express myself clearly and logically so there are definitely worse things to be immersed in from a rhetorical standpoint than good quality work by analytic philosophers    but maybe a lighter version of /nonovel19/ is more amenable and useful to most people where they just plan to read a bit more poetry or more shakespeare in 2019 if this thread was motivation for people to do that id be pretty happy btw if youre looking for a poetry recommendation my favourite poet at the moment is gerard manley hopkins quite a difficult writer but really rewarding as well
science fantasy edition  how do you like your science fantasy lite on science lite on fantasy or both in equal parts  what are your favorite science fantasy books    monthly reading for december the dying earth by jack vance    fantasy    general    flowchart      science fiction      general        nprs top 100 science fiction  fantasy books      sff author listing with ratings and summaries      previously                
tfw just read the dying earth  im reading cugels saga at the moment hopefully there will be some discussion on that too
  that doesnt make sense because then that changes the criteria for enjoyment that you rated those books  but thats completely normal your taste in books was the exact same when you had read 5 books as opposed to 500 most people tend to heavily overrate stuff when they are new to a medium and become stricter as they consume more
another one of my suggestions gets picked
how do i stop procrastinating and start writing my masters thesis  all i can find the time to do is write short stories and read sffg
  oh shit we finally have ourselves a decent monthly reading book after months of shit
  hit your dick with a hammer every hour you find yourself procrastinating
  that just seems like another means of procrastination
sanderfag a hack
  do you like hitting yourself in the dick with a hammer
  i can hit as hard as a hammer with my hand
  use a fucking hammer or dont bother at all scrungoid
  you probably havent watched it fag
  i couldnt stand cugel honestly
  by no means but hitting myself in the dick with a hammer would serve as a distraction to doing my thesis  should i check myself in
  i read lotr when i was 8 i cant remember what my taste in books was like when id only read five
  you wouldnt be procrastinating if you wanted to write your masters thesis drop out and work at a gas station while finishing your ya sf epic
  i would rather get on the dole that get a service wagie job

  how do monthly readings work is there a schedule
  see  
  thanks anon first one im gonna do
  please do not let tumblreads skew your view of the book its great
    you know whats great about the dying earth there is no answer only the oh shit moment in the story he appears in to make you wonder there is no lore to drown in in that collection only mystery     giving an answer would dilute that massively and make it a vastly inferior work when i look at contemporary writing riffing on classic fantasy its disappointing     take brandon sanderson if he wrote liane the wayfarer most likely he would tell a fan asking your question rafo and explain in detail what happened in his next book or the story would be part of an 800 word long text with at least three to seven short chapters of essentially exposition about the magics of the land and how this was possible     this is also a problem in videogame writing take pillars of eternity where lots of conversations are about how souls circulate the ins and outs of animancy what the gods are like  and this on top of endless books you can read which are mostly dry and academic lore mostly translates to boring infodump    compared to that i am chun the unavoidable is genius revealing how these things work never improves them

what are your favorite quotes on death i dont care if its from a poem a novel or even religious text i would like to read it all the same
  quotes  facebook is that way anon
  death is light as a feather    duty as heavy as a mountain
even though i walk in the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil they rod and they staff they comfort me    psalm 234
yeah its cheesy and campy and all carpe diem but its blunt and i like it    it is not death that a man should fear but he should fear never beginning to live marcus aurelius
  like the generations of leaves the lives of mortal men now the wind scatters the old leaves across the earth now the living timber bursts with the new buds and spring comes round again and so with men as one generation comes to life another dies away     glaucus son of hippolochus  homers iliad scroll 6
  from mexican poet jaime sabines    someone spoke to me all the days of my life / into my ear slowly taking their time / said to me live live live / it was death
  wow deep
  rosencrantz do you think death could possibly be a boat    guildenstern no no no death is not death isnt take my meaning death is the ultimate negative notbeing you cant not be on a boat    rosencrantz ive frequently not been on boats    guildenstern no no what youve been is not on boats    well not favourite but i just saw the movie and liked it
death is nothing to us when we exist death is not and when death exists we are not all sensation and consciousness ends with death and therefore in death there is neither pleasure nor pain the fear of death arises from the belief that in death there is awareness
  i prefer the opposite from ecclesiastes    so i returned and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun and behold the tears of such as were oppressed and they had no comforter and on the side of their oppressors there was power but they had no comforter wherefore i praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive yea better is he than both they which hath not yet been who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun
stop dying
  stop living

is violating your own identity the only true way of living authentically
there is no objective identity
  is that what you got out of the book
  fabricating your own history and self is almost a necessity to affirming your existence youll always be a slave to causality but it can be limited
muh identity
  yeah this
      genuinely curious here as well
  i am not sure what you mean but without context all i can say it that i dont think that the book is about that
what is the literary equivalent of logh
    logh it is an actual piece of literature
if you want space geopolitics that isnt the logh books then foundation trilogy is what you want
    i read foundation lately and you could tell how much of an influence it possibly was on logh no idea if tanaka actually read it or not but the prose reminded me a lot of asimovs work in the way it was laid out
  
  the equivalent is fucking of back to /a/
its basically war and peace x three kingdoms
falls in love with some crazy whore from alabama of all places  ruins his literary performance despite being talented    tragic isnt it
  falls in love with someone stable and gets his life back together  dies soon after
  well you havent gotten to my diary yet desu    you are in for a wild ride
  no because he had nothing new to contribute
  he was of irish descent  the drink would have gotten him eventually
  and neither have you
implying she wasnt the one who wrote all his pretty passages    he was just a mediocre story architect and political schmoozer
  implying some whore from alabama could write anything that her own name  anon i
  you clearly have never met an intelligent bipolar woman they basically communicate in disjointed poem dont know how to do anything practical though
  she was his muse for a reason
  i feel so injured
  thats not how muses work but whatever
  how muses work  are you a fucking retard its a fucking fake thing there is always a practical explanation
  not really a muse is source of inspiration but not fucking literally as in they tell him stuff but rather they make him see things that were already in him the hell with your practical explanations inb4 butthurt reply idgaf im right
  no youre not what you see comes from somewhere in this case her diary  youre clueless romantic who probably never touched a girl or felt true creative inspiration in your life
  thats not inspiration what youre talking about is influence you must be american you sound as autistic about art as one of them
its not like she was some random hick she was from a good alabama family every state has at least a few notable families heavily involved in politics and business the sayres as far as i can tell were one of those
  that literally doesnt even make sense a muse would also be a form influence but on its own it is a fantastical concept that really amounts to a fancy form of prostitution for practical purposes
  a fancy form of prostitution for practical purposes  now this doesnt even make sense but whatever youre conflating influence with inspiration have you ever been in love if i were to write a poem while being in love would that be an influence or an inspiration for you
  in a practical sense influence and inspiration are the same thing love isnt a real tangible either youre clearly a pretentious poet type so this will fly over your head rest assured the world wont give a shit about the subjective significance of your muse only what actually amounts to the product
  about the subjective significance of your muse only what actually amounts to the product  yeah but were discussing something else here so this is irrelevant and besides the point in practical terms a room and a prison cell are the same thing
  a bedroom a cell has a practical purpose as a living environment art is a product it has a means of production the glorification of this process is actually one mistake we are rightly stepping away from in the modern world not in the right direction as of yet but forward momentum is better than superstition
  all your points amount to semantics btw
  in reality there are many different kinds of influence  there has never been a documented example of true inspiration that couldnt be defined as a form of influence
      art is a product it has a means of production  this is where you and i disagree its clear this is a chiefly american view on art    the glorification of this process is actually one mistake we are rightly stepping away from in the modern world not in the right direction as of yet but forward momentum is better than superstition  cringe quite the opposite art is dying american cinema nowadays is shit
  using cinema as an example   turblopleb that was the whole point of the medium you anachronistic and deluded fuck americans are at the modern forefront of art for a reason its not a good one but it is necessary    all people really care about is the end result a room and cell are constructed similary but no one cares until its utilized  art has no true empirically true utilizaation so all you can do is look at the means by which it was created  you used a bad allegory
  all people really care about is the end result  yeah but were not talking about the end result you autist otherwise wed be fucking talking about it ffs    you used a bad allegory  thats not what allegory even means    americans are at the modern forefront of art for a reason  art is pretty much dead no one is at the forefront of a corpse     what happens in that scene is basically the american idea of art nowadays and what you get is soulless pieces of shit
  yeah but were not talking about the end result you autist otherwise wed be fucking talking about it ffs    we were in the case of the jail cell/bedroom metaphor    thats not what allegory even means  youre right but i could create an artistic reason for my choice    art is pretty much dead no one is at the forefront of a corpse   we are only exposing the truth dummy    only time will tell  my only true point is that you shouldnt place too much faith in your magical feelings realize a muse is just a tool and takes many forms
  yeah but were not talking about the end result you autist otherwise wed be fucking talking about it ffs  and in a sense that is all we talked about arts end result is just the combined effort of its means of production  you cnat say that entirely about a room designed for a specific controlled purpose
  my only true point is that you shouldnt place too much faith in your magical feelings realize a muse is just a tool and takes many forms  i agree then anon
  he was kind of faggy but i still love him for his good taste his love of joyce greeks and romans and his desire to live the literary chad lifestyle he was just a mommas boy at his core and though he was hetero he had slightly low self esteem and an effeminate nature     he had great aesthetic sense though i reread the last few pages of gatsby recently and it still holds up
    fell in love with literally mental woman  still published three masterpieces  spent time in paris and the mediterranean   was drunk the whole time    this guy is fucking untouchable you faggots have nothing on him he lived the life we all envy so get over it
  this    just because the guy wasnt a philosophical and political thinker doesnt make him a bad writer
  i never implied he was a bad writer on the contrary but he could have done so much more had he been driven and not wasted his time with zelda
  intelligent bipolar woman  keking at this
  intelligence is relative  most bipolar people are fucked up but sometimes they are maniacal manipulators in ways you wouldnt imagine
  god this board is bad now
  believe in a muse as an actual tangible thing worthy of respect  implying its not just a lame form of paganism    ok retard
  just because the guy wasnt a philosophical  all of his books amount to philosophical just not outright philosophy
  its not worthy of respect because you simply feed off your own reactions to someone causing emotional turbulence inside you love is just particularly potent at this    but paganism really
  implying thats what a muse/love is  first off love isnt a real thing  and what you described is called a fucking fire a hell of a motivator but nothing special
  love isnt a real thing  why
  fucking prove it thats why  it could awlays bee something else same deal with the muse  its romantic corruption of truth
  you have to be immature to confuse lust or infatuation or whatever other drive to possess with genuine love dont worry age will expand your emotional awareness
  implying thats love  thats a form of fear you learn to embrace in age  sorry boomer but your whole world is a lie and thats why you are poor dumb and essentially being cucked by life
  your cynicism is entirely misplaced and cliché proven by your wild assumptions  im propably younger than you but for your sake i hope im older because you should have outgrown that pathetic mindset before you reach 20
  you are probably just naive and dumb desu  when you get older and start working in the real world it becomes increasingly clear that love is sometihng more complex than muh feelings its about as depraved as your most lustful feelings but we dress it up all nice
  sure it is im not the one reducing the emotional depth and complexity of it though   its incredibly nuanced and rare but i know from firsthand experience it exists
  emotional depth complexity  all love is prostitution in a dress if you know how to properly analyze its complexity
  why because you rob each other of rights of freedom because you tailor reality to each others needs of course its a tradeoff a pact but what you get in return is vastly richer than what you sacrifice if you chose the right partner  who broke your heart anon
  no one broke my heart ive just been on all sides of female desire in my life  went from nothing to a big something and the crushing empty truth the thing most people are afraid to tell you came crashing down on me  you are young people are flawed and broken  love wont save you or them its something you learn to deal with but to glorify it is simply naive and childish imo
  all love is prostitution in a dress  dating is prostitution in a dress love is love
  love loves to love love am i rite  fucking fag dating is about the only time you will ever truly see what love really requires  when youre stuck with a person you lose sight of the reality for a variety of reasons its not because love is magic but because people are weak and lazy
  i understand but im more pragmatic about it than you think im no poet that glorifies it as the essence of life i just like to come home unburden myself with someone enjoy the soft feminine comforting energy be able to retreat from reality even for a moment with someone you cherish even if that emotions is fleeting that to me is the value of love
  what a misguided cynical and ridiculous argument you sound like an edgy teenager who thinks everything is fake and gay love makes your lose sight of reality because its a chemical reaction in the brain it has those effects on people you havent loved have you and no dating is like a socially acceptable form of prostitution love is something else entirely
  your girlfriend would leave you if she met someone better  consider this    its a chemical reaction in the brain  designed to promote our weakness and encourage childrearing on both sides enjoy being a womans tool
  your girlfriend would leave you if she met someone better    lets say this is partly correct and most women are hypergamous by nature  then i have countered this by being more attractive than her more charming and intelligent having constant female attention to fuel her jealousy which is a nice bonus on top of being ego nourishment she feels indebted to me just for my presence that facilitates love
  thats a form of prostitution though  you see my point
  not him but prostitution usually involves monetary or material things
  that sounds too vulgar to me its just a powerplay thats the main problem with love especially when were young we cant disconnect the machiavellian from the romantic
  usually  thats why i said form money is also hardly a real thing as well but try telling that to fools like you
  implying the romantic aspect of love isnt developed out of fear and mostly as a means of showing off or adapting to yet another form of prostitution
  money is very real i mean yeah it only works because we all have decided to agree on its power but it definitely exists unlike say borders or laws its certainly more real than those
  money is about as real as the law can be and by the transitive property borders as well  like i said you wouldnt understand because you believe in things like love  and this is coming from a wealthy guy who has a flock of female fans
  yet another form of prostitution  i dont think you know what prostitution even means its not only a thing that involves love and some exchange it has to have a monetary/material aspect in order for it to be prostitution
  its a metaphorical prostitution you literal dunce
  like i said you wouldnt understand because you believe in things like love  i never said i believed in love im not the other guy all i said was that love was a chemical reaction in the brain
  well youre right about that  my point was is that so is fear and my desire to cum on girls faces it is what it is you learn to deal with it and how to pimp it better but at the end of the day its an ugly thing
  metaphorical prostitution  theres no such thing there isnt a thing in your replies where exchange couldnt have been used instead of prositution prostitution is just a exchange sex for money money for sex thats it
  it implies a dirty trade  and uh pretty sure metaphors arent technically real now are they love is just a metaphor
  actual definition  the unworthy or corrupt use of ones talents for the sake of personal or financial gain    retard just about anything could be whorish
  but at the end of the day its an ugly thing  it is a game for dirty players indeed
  hows that anons love like prostitution though
  women are hypergamous by nature  will always leave you for someone better recall that as much as you might tihnk so you are not teh best you out there in the world you are not special  he has to counter this by being more attractive intelligent and likable than her   tthe mere use of the word counter implies an antagonistic relationship  doesnt realize his relationship is actually centered around control and a warlike drum in his heart hes dumb enough to call love
  women are hypergamous by nature  gotcha i believe they call it monkey branching in dating circles like how a monkey jumps to a better branch or whatever all in all women are whores and we are their psuedoclients
to use the stylistic conventions of the traditional oral novel  the sequential narrative characters in the round consecutive events balloons of dialogue attached to he said and she said  is to perpetuate a set of conventions ideally suited to the great tales of adventure in the conradian mode or an overformalized jamesian society but now valuable for little more than the bedtime story and the fable to use these conventions to describe events in the present is to write a kind of historical novel in reverse    was he right
  yes
yes
  little more than the bedtime story and the fable  i love ballard but this is just clueless the bedtime story and the fable are means by which humanity preserves and transmits essential truths about its own nature avant garde literature is all well and good but tradition is equally important

  butchers crossinng is excellent but its a totally different book and hard to compare i remember bc producing very vivid visuals for me while reading
  stoner is good     sometimes it is great but mostly it is good     what makes it great is actually the beauty of the prose the ideas of the book do not ennoble the spirit    i liked it better when this was just a fun 2week winter read not its where pseuds gather to celebrate their ability to read through an entire book
  stoner is a grown mans catcher in the rye
  shut the fuck up about prose just shut the fuck up you are not a good reader and seem like a very stupid person
    the meme squad already here
  the ideas of the book do not ennoble the spirit  no he said that youre kidding
  just so you know the cover has nothing to do with the book its actually a painting from 1900

someone please help define to me what this genre is i dont even know if it would be correct to term it slipstream im talking about a blend of scifi fantasy horror and literary fiction like in gene wolfes the book of the new sun i also see it in ursula k leguins work particularly that pastoral scene near the end of the earthsea quartet lovecraft also has this feeling its not quite cosmic horror its more of a feeling of cosmic awe and melancholy at the eventual triumph of nature over civilisation it also has elements of philosophical fiction and psychoanalytic symbolism another work that brings to mind is mccarthys the road yet another might be murakamis hardboiled wonderland at the end of the world maybe im just describing my taste i like virginia woolfs works and her streamofconsciousness writingstyle and descriptions if anyone could help to define to me what im talking about then i would be grateful book recommendations would be nice but i also want to write in this style and this atmosphere and tone that i cant define picrelated is a cyberpunk anime i like set on a seed ship heading away from our solar system but 1000 years after its departure i posted a similar thread yesterday but i didnt get any responses so once again please grace me with your benevolent presence /lit/
  okay the blend youre talking about tends to be called either neonoir if its dark in tone or simply speculative fiction slipstream can be conceptualized with a dial on one side is hard science eg shit we know is possible on the other is basically fantasy stuff like string theory and ftl travel slipstream turns that dial all but a bit above basically fantasy and does crazy shit with it

i started reading nietzsche over a year ago and hes had a profound effect on me so this isnt me trying to discredit him    something im having trouble getting over is the idea that nietzsches will to power just leads to narcissism i had that inkling when i first started reading him and sorta just wrote it off as my attachment to slave morality     however i just read stanley rosens mask of enlightenment in which he makes the case that nietzsches esoteric  exoteric doctrines are incompatible he ends the book with     it is time to reexamine the enlightenment with open eyes free of ideology and  jargon whether this jargon stems from poetry or mathematics at his best this is the direction in which nietzsche points us at his worst he points us toward narcissism as long as the higher men are hypnotized by simulacra of their own cleverness we will continue to dwell in the epoch of the last men    which seems to confirm my initial gut reaction     i imagine theres 2 responses to this     1 it does lead to narcissism and theres nothing wrong with that  2 it doesnt lead to narcissism it leads to x    im open to any responses cause im honestly confused myself
  will to power is just the force that underlies a persons modus operandi it is not something a person can directly control but is rather the underlying fact behind every action a person takes a man can do what he wills but cannot will what he wills as schopenhauer would say to say that it necessarily leads to narcissism is patently false because with a most basic analysis this would mean that everyone must necessarily be narcissistic  much of nietzsches prescription to his readers is based on amor fati love of ones fate  that an understanding of ones place among men is a way to overcome ressentiment realize your will to power and ultimately affirm your own existence
  nietzsche was a narcissist but the overman isnt
  wasnt nietzsche prescription also striving to be the ubermensch or is also part of amor fati meaning some people will become the ubermensch by fate
  correct he was very much a nonbeliever in enlightenment égalité it also does not follow that the overman can be over anything if everyone is an overman
    cont although he perhaps believed that an understanding of all of the underlying factors of will to power as it relates to hierarchy made a person more likely to achieve selfaffirmation as an overman but this is up for debate nietzsche never came across as a strict determinist to me
whats nietzsches deal with pity
  this basically
  it also does not follow that the overman can be over anything if everyone is an overman  nietzsche was definitely against the egalitarian impulse but the overman is created of solitude and selfovercoming his position is not in itself hierarchical though the top of mans heirarchy of domination is a necessary bridge to the overman in other words the proles will never become overmen because they are proles not that they are proles because they will never become the overman
  narcissism is another external imposition of will if you are a slave to your passions you are not transvaluating values you are being dictated to by biology slave/master morality is a bit of a false dilemma because it didnt seem to me like neech was suggesting a simple return to master morality but rather we can use the genealogy as a stepping stone out of historical conceptions it is a tool for the overman to overcome
narcissism as is the case with other disorders exists only in relation to the society the ill person lives in in ours narcissistic traits are considered a disorder but in a different one theyd be the norm    since ubermenschism is antisocial by its very nature its only narcissistic through our societys point of view which isnt very relevant
  i dont know that he truly believed it or if he was just trying to take his idea to its most appealing conclusion with unrealistic gravitas this is why i think the overman is nietzsche at his worst
  i got the same impression when i read zarathustra until one passage where he talked about how he himself never strove to become the overman but to make the path better for his children i think that emphasis on posteritys success over your own is admirable
  or if he was just trying to take his idea to its most appealing conclusion with unrealistic gravitas  this what are you 13 youre not going to learn anything practical from reading this ___poet
  modern psychology only treats people to merely sustain this capitalistic system if youre working for yourself shying away from work and school youre seen as odd and you have to purge yourself to fall back in line
  this makes no sense what are you even talking about not following passions doesnt exalt life     all this autistic reductionist crap of biology as the master completely eschews the fundamental concepts of consciousness which is the basis of all western philosophy jesus bud
      i cant imagine there will be a society or economic system where humans arent interdependent we would literally have to evolve into vulcans which i guess would take his ubermensch idea literally whether or not that evolution would be good or not is a whole another debate    it seems to me that using nietzsche as a way to live life seems counterproductive the way its peddled here and to disaffected youth as the answer seems harmful because you reach this conclusion that its societys fault its capitalism or whatever that is holding you back instead of the truth which is our current human nature again for better or worse requires us to have meaningful connections with one another its very few people that can live life in isolation so nietzsche as pop psychology has not gotten us any closer to the ubermensch its just led youth astray in this the dead end that is navel gazing self improvement
  thats because of their fundamental lack of philisopical background the will is a very complicated term and just doesnt mean huurrrrr do what you want youll die anyway   it suggests your will to power is being realistic with your own capabilities and illusions and roughly falling in line with what is willed upon you by your higher self all inline with the laws of the universe it means work for the good of all men by what you can do to people yeah this would mean following their artistic talents instead of becoming a grump behind a cash register theyd offer more positivity trough their artistic potential then merely working a menial job
  than  literally drinking my morning cup as i write this
  all this autistic reductionist crap of biology as the master completely eschews the fundamental concepts of consciousness which is the basis of all western philosophy    nice cope bucko it was all trash get over it
  i thought he said he was a failure of his own ideal and only in rejecting him could he be fully understood
  wew anon this was a spectacular shit post where do i begin lets start with the double negative  not following passions doesnt exalt life  hopefully i parse this trainwreck correctly you mean following passions isnt an exaltation of life to which i would say you didnt read what i wrote i said being a slave to your passions is an imposition of external morality this would imply that biology is explicitly not the master and the reason why narcissists fail to overcome the transvaluation of values is precisely because by definition their biology is master they are guided by particular pathological behavioral ticks this is something which is echod by the stoics you know the greeks the thing you are trying to virtue signal over by pointing to the basis of all western philosophy nothing in the post had anything to do with consciousness in anything more than a tangential way too so you are really scraping the bottom of the barrel here congrats you got my effort post for the day
  op here not the person youre responding to how would you disentangle narcissism as a pathological behavioral tick from the will to power    for example lets see you accidentally dent someones car and nobody sees it the will to power response would mean you just drive off instead of leaving a note and causing your insurance to go up or paying 800 to replace a bumper because its the right thing to do ie subscribing to slave morality    how would that action not be narcissistic
  doesnt really want you to reject him just dont be a mere follower he wants peers and people who surpass him
  narcissists fail to overcome the transvaluation of values  this is entirely conjecture and based on your own opinion im sorry you hate some narcissist or you are one and cant break out of your addiction to the internet its not okay to hate yourself anon     this is something which is echod by the stoics you know the greeks  absolutely cringe have fun with your empty philosophy that is as laughable as positivism     i was agreeing with you but youre retarded so you just reached for semantics do you get off on connecting things that have no real connections
  to feel pity towards an ordinary man an overman would neccessarily have to lower himself to the ordinary mans level because ideally an overman should be so far ahead that he doesnt even consider the ordinary man at all    gods feeling pity towards men implies uncertainty in his actions it rots away the high image of being a god if hes so great ordinary mens problems shouldnt even begin cross his mind let alone evoke pity    as soon as you feel pity you validate and put weight to that which you pity the difference between a god or an overman and an ordinary man should be so great that the ordinary mans grievances are nothing more than a speck of dust for the god or an overman
  never use the term navel gazing again
  it is a gross mistake therefore when historians of morals start with questions like why have sympathetic actions been praised the noble type of man regards himself as a determiner of values he does not require to be approved of he passes the judgment what is injurious to me is injurious in itself he knows that it is he himself only who confers honour on things he is a creator of values he honours whatever he recognizes in himself such morality equals selfglorification in the foreground there is the feeling of plenitude of power which seeks to overflow the happiness of high tension the consciousness of a wealth which would fain give and bestowthe noble man also helps the unfortunate but notor scarcelyout of pity but rather from an impulse generated by the superabundance of power bge chapter 9    i think for n what lesser men experience as pityingsomeone the higher man experiences as something closer to anactofclemency
  your idea of narcissism probably doesnt line up with n or his will to power zarathustra says to his followers that they should despise themselves at some point the overman is hard on himself loving oneself isnt the same as being a narcissist go back to the greeks

  cs lews was a hegelian of sorts before converting to christianity he didnt publish anything during this time it was just in vogue when he was at oxford    as a result his works of popular theology beloved by evangelifags contain sideswipes at hegel a demon praises hegel as one of their agents in the screwtape letters

  he said enough about communism that we can say that what came about as actually existing socialism did not satisfy his conditions for communism chief among them the desolution of state
  worst attempt at a put down i have read today

  postmodernity  i used to think that until i actually read the classics  physical beauty has always been seen as a moral virtue in european culture more so in ancient times than today when we have the ressentiment fueled idea of shallowness and how supposedly attractive people are less kind which is completely untrue in reality
  hi nietzsche  youre right funnily enough /r9k/ defends chad from this resentful normie meme
  and how supposedly attractive people are less kind   look up the halo effect maybe stereotypically we think they are less kind but when dealing with individuals we are far nicer to attractive individuals

  youre on a literature board its useful for reading some of the greatest literature in the world retard and im saying the only reason to learn spanish would be to put it on your resume because america likes their menial laborers to know spanish because we are overrun with them
im learning italian and spanish because i got two side bitches from italy and spain d    so far spanish seems much more better as it is spoken in spain mexico columbia puerto rico    the spanish girl is nicer too although they are very childish compared to women here finland
never read italian literature aside from the mediaevals and dont really know any so ill say spanish given just how much authors and countries the language covers      spanish has a lot of great literature
  spanish women are the best in europe
  italian is useful for reading some of the greatest literature in the world  followed by  the only reason to learn spanish would be to put it on your resume  lmao

x language isnt useful  what fucking world are you people from almost no language is useful outside of your native one and the lingua franca unless you just so happen to be gunning for a translationrelated job you learn a third language because its interesting because you want to visit the country where its spoken because you want to read its literature    get the fuck out of here with your faggot utilitarian requirements the only useful language according to you fucks seems to be mandarin which is not only a massive bother to learn but means youll be spending your time getting scammed by the chinese for the rest of your professional life might as well preemptively kill yourself to avoid the trouble
  stop learning languages to speak to people  reeeeeeee
  go on
spanish is the only option

what do i do /lit/ the only careers i would find fulfilling being a freelance writer a novelist an artist an art critic an essayist are impossible to find success in i cant help but compare myself to writers before me all of whom are greater than i could ever be the past seems filled with impassioned  prolific movements of artistic intellectual philosophical genius the années folles the situationist international the beat generation the existentialiststhe contemporary era seems empty everything is accumulated online but it is diluted and disparate  academia would seem to be the logical option but it has become so commodified  subsumed under the logic of the market that at best i would end up publishing niche works of zero consequence to the indifferent reception of a negligible readership  life is boring i dont want to kill myself because it would upset people too much what do i do

fuck ive got too many    a spice vendor and a lunar princess get chased across the deserts of mars by a drug kingpin  the subway makes an unscheduled service change into another universe and now the passengers have to walk home through every citys weird side  a plantation slave has her own rebellion pulled out from under her when her runaway brother returns bearing dark powers and an ancient and powerful patron  a roman girl learns her father is the god vulcan which would have been enough of a problem if it wasnt currently the renaissance now she has to escape the inquisiton  the intentionally scandalous and wildly unbelievable autobiography of a certain mad chocolatier
  i like the third one but im not too big on fantastical elements personally of course this is just my opinion but i think you could definitely write something based off of the same premise but instead of bearing dark powers the brother comes back as a slave owner himself à la django unchained
  honestly thats the one im the least proud of the storys actually supposed to be an edgy retelling of the book of exodus with miriam as the main character if i do it ill have to change the ending to give her some kind of catharsis

  australia really hot summer police station in some shithole its a night and one of cops get a weird phone begging for help he decides to check it  while he drives to his destinations one of the campings nearby  he bumps into weird creature and have odd visions/hallucinations anyway when he finally arrives to the place he got phone from he finds two confused people they dont remember anything but they are so fucking scared that he dont even check place where it all happened but quickly take them to the doctor   he cant quite forget about all what happened and end up doing research on his own  he discovers that some nasty things happened in this area in the past soon it all starts happening again he is not sure if it all really is real or it is only him that can see that some paranormal stuff happens and really brutal murders idk what next you can give me some ideas
      would read
  this is a cool idea you could find some archived /x/ greentexts and get some ideas from there they always use the same tropes in every story and put your own spin on them so they arent tired cliches
  why dont you like fantasy
  they are arguing about /lit/ meme philosophers land evola guenon hegel heidegger foucault etc that and the occult because theyre dragons and magick is real for them

while we speakin on woke fiction who read this
do you also read to escape the horror that is your existence
  read about the horror of existence   if im going to be on mr bones wild ride then ill know every nook and cranny of it
  yes but i recognize that the best literature is about the horror of life as well and i cant settle for lesser works
  yes unlike reality while reading a book i can tell myself its just fiction if things go bad
  no not really i read to gain new perspectives on things besides i dont see life as very horrific
  slaps your face with horrific reality
  yea im doing it right now im even a phone fag like in the illustration
  of course
  if you really think that is horrific you are the definition of homophobic
  unironically orthodox catholic mysticism            
  um sweetie that isnt an insult its a compliment
  you spelled sane white christian wrong
  well personally i dont see any reason a christian or anyone has to be horrified by homosexuals or anything at all
  why do you have a trip on an anonymous norwegian drum circle imageboard
  the truth is i think it will keep me from shitposting since i have some accountability i dont really care about anonymous culture it was fun when i was on /b/ 10 years ago but now it doesnt seem so special
  leviticus 2013  13  if a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman both of them have done what is detestable they are to be put to death their blood will be on their own heads    im not horrofied by them im horrorfied by the fact theyre allowed to exist
  god allows them to exist
but escapism doesnt work when you know it has to end attempts at escapism just produce more anxiety in me
  this desu  mysticism keeps men sane as long as you have mystery you have health when you destroy mystery you create morbidity the ordinary man has always been sane because the ordinary man has always been a mystic he has permitted the twilight he has always had one foot in earth and the other in fairyland he has always left himself free to doubt his gods but unlike the agnostic of today free also to believe in them he has always cared more for truth than for consistency if he saw two truths that seemed to contradict each other he would take the two truths and the contradiction along with them his spiritual sight is stereoscopic like his physical sight he sees two different pictures at once and yet sees all the better for that thus he has always believed that there was such a thing as fate but such a thing as free will also thus he believed that children were indeed the kingdom of heaven but nevertheless ought to be obedient to the kingdom of earth he admired youth because it was young and age because it was not it is exactly this balance of apparent contradictions that has been the whole buoyancy of the healthy man the whole secret of mysticism is this that man can understand everything by the help of what he does not understand the morbid logician seeks to make everything lucid and succeeds in making everything mysterious the mystic allows one thing to be mysterious and everything else becomes lucid the determinist makes the theory of causation quite clear and then finds that he cannot say if you please to the housemaid the christian permits free will to remain a sacred mystery but because of this his relations with the housemaid become of a sparkling and crystal clearness he puts the seed of dogma in a central darkness but it branches forth in all directions with abounding natural health as we have taken the circle as the symbol of reason and madness we may very well take the cross as the symbol at once of mystery and of health buddhism is centripetal but christianity is centrifugal it breaks out for the circle is perfect and infinite in its nature but it is fixed for ever in its size it can never be larger or smaller but the cross though it has at its heart a collision and a contradiction can extend its four arms for ever without altering its shape because it has a paradox in its centre it can grow without changing the circle returns upon itself and is bound the cross opens its arms to the four winds it is a signpost for free travellers
  thats true but behaving like a degenerate freak is not biological necessity merely their sexual inclination is which can be mastered through chastity
  no he doesnt he drowned them one time and killed them with fire another time next time hell put them to death for good and with them our goverments because they didnt let us get rid of those abominations
  well likely the same could be applied to most people
  oh yeahnext time what is he waiting for all the torah did was put values which promoted social cohesion and group survival into the mouth of god to give them weight to make those hebrews feel like their lives mattered as they wandered a desert for 40 years
  matthew 1034  think not that i am come to send peace on earth i came not to send peace but a sword  soon  its obvious to christians   however ever jews agree its the endtimes red heifer third temple snake in wall and with them muslims
  youre cherry picking odd fragments especially that one which implies that you should leave your family and everything you cling to in order to follow christ but in stead you spend your time arguing with me on an anime/porn site in your parents house drag queens due to their fabulous shamelessness give you comfort because you dont have to consider your own spiritual impotence in stead you can just imagine your own virtues as opposed to their supposed vices or whom i kidding your probably posting from the monastery computer
  i read to face it
  youre are the worst kind of pseud
  entertainment is used for escaping/forgetting your life and art is for remembering your life
  cherry picking  i answered youre questions you dont have to believe me howerver later you cannot say you didnt know i dont care who you imagine me to be
  it certainly can the churchs position on sexuality seems homophobic only because straight christians dont often follow the rules properly themselves for instance oral is considered a sin but im sure many christians arent even aware of this or short of that simply dont care the distinction between hetero and homosexuality has really made it difficult to communicate the churchs teachings on the matter as it is not simply about inclination and personal enjoyment it is also about act and end the physicality of certain acts is clearly divinely ordered whereas others are clearly not the fact that homosexual men cant consummate without risking injury suggests the problematic nature of their acts its complicated but our society cares about nothing but consent as if that were a sufficient criteria for the goodness and morality of a sex act the porn industry attests to this fact
  you have not answered a thing i know the context of the scripture youve quoted and i have answered in kind with context whats more is you are being disingenuous and i have no share in that because i dont subscribe to christian morality nor claim to you are the one being luke warm and youll be spat out of gods mouth like the rest of us if it comes to that
  my life is pretty fucking great so no    the best literature is about the horror of life  you only think this because you fuccbois are so obsessed with feeling bad
  i dont even consider condemnation of homosexuality to be homophobia but saying drag queens are horrific is definitely homophobic i dont think condemnation even follows the rigors of the christian morality as it was described by its founder anyway and to me the obvious despair horror and wrath engendered by condemnation seems to suggest it is incompatible with christs example of mercy and long suffering
  drag queens are horrific is definitely homophobic  they are a plainly offensive characature of real femininity by men that for whatever reason are not well adjusted enough to live normally    i am charitable to these people its just difficult to remain sympathetic to people who are so clearly obstinate in the face of real help its like trying to help an alcoholic in denial
  if reading takes you away from the serious things in life i dont know what you could possibly be reading besides a book meant for children
  have you ever actually tried to help an alcoholic in denial or for that matter a drag queen anyway being put off by something and being horrified are different to me life is not horrific and even things i disagree with or have major problems with have their charm they are human at least the downfall of christian ethos is that it is espoused with inconsistency by people who practice it inconsistently in their own lives and the love of truth would lead anyone to despise itpharisees the lot of them and woe unto them
  help  whats there to help they chose to be abominations of course one can tell them theyre wrong and should stop being degenerates but try that on twitter and youll get banned for hatespeech
  well sometimes help is more than just saying hey stop that faggot  like if we really cared about abortion we would try to help mothers who are in a bad situation to have security and raise their kids but instead lean on legalistic methods instead which is one of the things the story of christ most fully shames and criticizes
  basically most proselytizing larpers on 4chan enjoy the unwarranted superiority the law gives them but doesnt recognize that the law makes us all sinners and they are also too uncaring or lazy to put their ethics into practice which calls them to be healers and what not so they end up defiling the name of christ and probably damning themselves if not for the salvation which is given freely we hope
  nah actions have consequences
  actions have consequences   what a way to say nothing
  i think you would have a hard time finding someone who didnt find that horrific or at least grotesque that homosexuality is wrong is practically the consensus opinion of all mankind

what do you guys think of this philosophy test i put together are the results at all accurate or am i a pseud    
yes you are pseud because you are guided by binary constructs and try to quantify unquantifiable
  its futile i know but a general idea of how people think can still be constructed
  i think the results were accurate
this is a cool test anon good work the questions are well thought out
some of these isms on the two poles of various axoims arent really opposed to each other they are more like monadic systems of their own how is rationalism the opposite of romanticism or why is skepticism placed vs absolutism   another issue is that the isms themselves are usually very vague and you have to explicitly state what they mean  the questions are about peoples psychology and minor preferences rather than philosophical beliefs and ideals the result just gives you some fashionable name to identify with because of some preferences you knowing the reasons behind goes completely out of question  all in all if this catches on it will just contribute to making more of a whore out of philosophy like those facebook meme pages are doing zero substance and thinking just names and labels and memes      7 axis each an spectrum  reeee binaries  muh quantification this is not btw  you are more of a pseud than op
  in ops defense i dont think things need to be exact opposites for them to make sense being opposite of each other
  im not particularly committed these tests generally rely on a gut instinct reaction the problem is that when the topic is philosophy our thoughts tend to be a lot more nuanced the way questions are phrased doesnt really allow for much distinction between private/subjective preferences i would rather live in x society which could reflect any temperament altruism egoism etc and absolute/objective x social order is good
good work op thats pretty close to reality
  and those questions arent very accurate one should think about what the author wants to ask or just have a pleb understanding of thos topics    despite of that its the best personality test ive made
huh
is there a way to view all the possible results
  i just try to ignore the nuance and know that the question is asking for a general answer on a broad level there are important specifics that   wont tell you about me but as he says here  its still a good general description

what does this say about me
  you like rick and morty
  ive never watched it
the only philosophy ive read is the entire works of plato
  i hate when these quizzes pad their question count out by just rewording shit this is just the inverse of the ends justify the means question it gave me 2 questions earlier
gives me a 404 on the results page 
this website doesnt even exist fuck off
  error 404 did you cancel the website
  it gives me a 404
  the high asceticism makes up for the rest
sorry lads it got taken down because of too much traffic  ill see if i can get it back up
new url for anyone just seeing this thread      only a temp fix but ill have to buy more hosting
          new link 
  this sort of shit just doesnt and will never work with philosophy since the field is about fundamental assumptions for example egoism and altruism cant be measured as characteristics because they dont refer to personal qualities but certain understanding of the social fields on which personal qualities are played out    tldr you are a brainlet and these tests always suck even astrology is unironically better because it is spiritual hoodoo upfront
tfw intp fencesitter  feels good not feeling too extremely about anything in particular
  you havent seen nothing yet
  you are infp
            you all sicken me
  the link isnt working for me is there something wrong
  see 
  this
  you seem like a chill dude
its no longer up
can someone tell me what this means  i said i dont know to a lot of them
  philosophy test   am i a pseud  as if you have to fucking ask
  see 
   t brainlet  those two questions are clearly distinct
meh lacks nuance on many points
um
what am i other than a faggot
for this i think you got the first two words mixed up or you forgot a question mark
  
intentionally go out of my way to avoid the neutral option  fencesitter nature still comes out    fuck how come i dont get icons at the bottom like the rest of you guys
  i dunno why i did this or what it proves but here it is
would expect my skepticism to be higher but otherwise i feel its about right
no wonder i dont fit in on /lit/
  those results seem pretty /lit/tier to me
  op the link is down    please make it available again it was a good test i want to send it to some friends
shitposting is sentient
  please look harder next time  
i guess i dont know where to stand
  i think you should try to understand platonic thinking a little more itll carry over into spiritualism     also maybe try understanding the necessities of human emotions you seem to work with logic for your world view which isnt bad but you are essentially only using half your brain power when you do that emotion is an objective way of viewing phenomenon so use it
getting a 403 whats the deal op
  link is down
link is rip
it works for me 
        op here old link 404d because of traffic  new link is   im going to try and see if i can reregister the old link
  stirner as opposed to altruism  no he just felt you should be altruistic for reasons other than societal pressures like national pride
  nice spot fixed it
intresting test but the questions definitely need to be less generalized and abstract not that its a bad thing but for a 2 binary scale it just doesnt work
pretty accurate good job op
not sure how accurate this is i mean i dont watch porn or drink but i still browse 4chan i cant be that ascetic
  accurate
  link isnt working
  refer to  
i got a cross at the bottom    what does this mean anons
seems legit although i consider myself more of a materialist and skeptic than this indicates
  very similar results anon  do you like jordan peterson
  it means youre based and redpilled
  the cross symbol just means monotheist
id put people in death camps if given the chance
  i feel like this is the most based spectrum
i dont really know what to take from this do these near 50/50 splits indicate im a realist or something if it helps anyone to know im not religious
  probably more infp get trt before its too late
  we dont think of you at all
  were actually really close besides nihilism    this is me and i share your sentiment
  if you guys enjoyed this i suggest you check out buzzfeed lots of cool and fun stuff like this on there 
  wah le edgy selfaware humor  people like quizzes you nigger
  chill and funpilled
  it was fun      you wanna be a monk or something
we are all insignificant in the eyes of the universe  i hate questions like these the universe doesnt have eyes or to not take it too literally the universe as a whole doesnt have a subjective experience or qualia we as a species have these eyes so to speak and we are a part of the universe and we are significant to one another so from that perspective you could answer in the affirmation but without this context answering in agreement or disagreement implies some sort of spiritualreligious sense of significance or insignificance that neither of which represent my beliefs well
  seems to be a hit op
  theres no such thing as unquantifiable you just have very poor understanding of neurons brain chemistry and mathematics
  im a pretty neutral fella
  mine was very similar
  62 tabs  what the heck anon
  thats the case with some of the questions like   life is suffering and fundamentally meaningless  what if i consider life meaningless but not suffering im enjoying it but i dont consider it having any particular meaning or what if i consider life suffering but not meaningless   there is an underlying morality in everything that we do  morality means different things for different people whether youre a hedonist or utilitarian wouldnt your own actions will always seem moral in your framework  without music life would be a mistake  music or art in general how do deaf people play into this i find music enjoyable but i find reading much more   life is despair  etc theyre not really questions with clearly defined yes/no answers but its good enough given that anything more accurate than this would have to be a personal 1 on 1 analysis you cant really get too deep with massproduced surveys aimed at thousands of people at the same time    itd be interesting if people also posted their results to this    alongside their chart
dang im so extreme for some of the categories
  yeah every time i want to use the web i just open a new tab when it reaches 100 open tabs i usually just close everything and start the cycle again

how about this
  testosterone replacement therapy dont listen to anon noninfps feel threatened by infps because they show that its okay to be emotional and vulnerable something most guys struggle dealing with
im too much of a skeptic for these tests
  tfw conflicted and inconsistent
i dont like it had to stop 5 questions in keep trying  also the purpose of this test is redundant anyone with any real knowledge of philosophy already knows what the believe
what am i
  ty d yeah ive never thought of it like that i still figure most people on this board are probably in tune with themselves have a higher degree of empathy thanks to the great writers and are comfortable with all the irrationality that comes with being a human
wtf why cant i acess it

  thanks it seems emotions are my blindspot the subject is too prevalent in my life for me to ignore it anymore ill have to accept them and use them dumb robotic autism is not a good way to emote
      i think you guys are overreacting a tad i just answered the questions honestly rather than pretending to be living some sort of idealized life i like to have a good time but i dont think im 100 hedonistic

the recognitions vs jr    which one did you like more
  i liked the recognitions more although jr was funnier i really like jrs narrative style also but with prose like gaddis using mostly dialogue made me long for some delicious runon sentences
dishonest garbage
both are really good but jr has less fat on it
the recognitions is in a different league the national book award for jr was an apology for ignoring wyatt gwyon       jr isnt funnier i just reread both       can you elaborate      jr also has less content corporation bad art good i felt like bast by the end asking jr to just leave me alone maybe that was the joke though could have used a lot more jr in the book desu senpai
  i definitely laughed in jr more
  jack and jr were p funny but a lot of the humor for me was like ohmmm how drolll hmmm i only loled a few times over 700 pages
bump
bump
the recognitions is more impressive and has the larger scope but j r has a far better cast of characters which made it a more engaging work for me    also as other people have said j r is funnier i laughed every time the stupid  wise potato chips hoppin with flavor  bag was mentioned in the crowded apartment

 no but you dont get it bast didnt you read all the literture i sent you boy here i am thinking we can help each other out and you didnt even read all the literture i sent youno but thats the point see you dont even have to read the book like you just go on this here site called 4chan and on 4chan they have these neat things called boards and one of them is called lit and thats where you talk about the no but thats the thing bast you dont even have to read the book bast thats the best part no but holy why would you read the book when you can just pretend that you read it nobody can tell thats whats so no but wait wait a second no but bast you dont even have to read it i told you you go to this here board called lit and you do this thing called shitposting no but holy shit bast thats what its called im not the one who invented it what you do is like you say something about the book like whatever you want it doesnt even have to make sense and then what happens is other people read your postno but theyre nobody it doesnt matter who they are you never actually see them or anything theyre just like us theyre posting on this here 4chan site and they didnt read the book either see thats just how it works nobody actually reads the books they just talk about them and write these here things called bait and what happens is if your bait is good then you get all these neat things called yous what yeah yous like you but with an s no not you like you bast like you is whats written on the board its this neat thing called a you thats just what its calledand what you do is that the more yous you get the better you are i dont know what you do with all the yous you just want to get as many of them as possible thats what you do and if you want even more yous you can add pictures like this here cartoon frog called pepper or peppy or somethingdidnt you get the pictures i sent you holy shit bast i have to do everything myself here i am trying to help you out so that you have time to work on your music i mean youre always talking about all the music you have to work on so i thought maybe we can help each other out but you dont even no i know that but what holy shit bast i dont know why theres a frog thats just how it is theyre these things called memes you just post them over and over again i dont know why holy shit bast you just use these here memes to get as many yous as you can wait bast fine you dont have to post the frog you can just post what you want but whatno but it doesnt matter if you dont know what to post you just look at whatever everyone else is posting and you just post the same thing thats whats so neat about the whole thing you just look at everyone else see bast and then you just do what theyre doing and when you get a you what you do is you give a you to the person who gave you a bast hey bast
  i laughed
taking my usual evening stroll round the neighborhood it struck that my mood changes in accordance with the geometry of architecture around the pace of my steps would change for seemingly no reason my mind would assign meanings to the looming structures ahead passing cars and cracked pavements i realised that hume was ultimately right only he didnt take empiricism far enough theres no bundle to define an object rather its a net of evercrossing affllictions where patterns emerge at random   thank you david hume
how do you plan a novel what is your process what level of detail do you go into
why is this shit so hard to read am i a brainlet i read the stranger which was great so i figured i would read this because camus was my favorite portion of a philosophy class i took in college but the writing is extremely heavy and easy to lose track of what hes saying i made it about 10 pages in and my head hurts now any tips
  man i glad you made this thread because i thought i was the only one who felt that way its written in a away where it seems like it should be easy to understand but like you said its easy to get lost
  his nonfiction writing seems extremely layered when hes trying to argue various points i know what the thesis of the book is but just in the few pages ive read so far i have no idea what the fuck hes talking about other than suicide may or may not be absurd
its a pile of garbage its hard to read because its meant to be a series of striking remarks and has a vague and deliberately misleading argumentative structure whetr argument is invoked wherever the author feels like it and overlooked wherever the author feels like it
its hard to read because he writes like an asshole to make life is meaningless cuz it dont last 4eva seem like a profound and correct statement
  life is meaningless because it is not eternal would indeed be profound if correct why isnt it correct
  tfw i aced a quiz about camus in my philosophy class bassed solely on some /lit/ green text about it being hot outside
  are you learning a lot at university right now if no is it you or the universitys fault if one or both why are you at university
  it is incorrect because its a nonsequitur meaning doesnt count on immortality
  save yourself some time and skip it camus thinking isnt especially rigorous here he as an artist first and a philosopher well not really  one must imagine sisyphus happy  but why why must one he never really explains this just states it is so
    first of all you cant know sitting in your armchair that life absolutely cant last forever ie that in some very distant future say a few millennia such a thing might not become possible that it is just physically outside of the realm of possibility this might not be true for all we know
    i see meaning and temporality have no essential connection in any logical sense after all meaningless things might persist forever and meaningful things might expire quickly in great fits of passion     this all seems rather abstract can you name a temporary thing which is also meaningful for my part i can think of nothing meaningless which is eternal
  if life having meaning is related at all to mortality i would make the argument that mortality adds meaning to life by forcing a being to consider how the finite time is spent and make value judgements based on the compared meanings of different actions the meaning is there to begin with though awareness of mortality may just make the person more aware of the meaning and more likely take consistent actions towards a larger goal     i deny the existence of meaningless things to begin with   can you name a temporary thing which is also meaningful  this thread
  in defense of that point to put it in human language how can anything hold meaning when you know everything you do will be erased from existence at some point many people live for their legacy in the hopes that some part of their efforts will outlive them and be preserved for some time but how long is that time its a blink of an eye on cosmic timescales ultimately all your efforts to make life better are for naught this is really the essence of absurdism life is inherently absurd but again we cont know for sure that life cant be eternal meaning then can be found in the search for this goal its a small glimmer of hope to be sure but life depends on hope in order to go on
  if everything is meaningful then nothing is meaningful and therefore meaning is meaningless in which case why speak of it
  people endlessly speak of meaning and purpose almost as if trying to talk themselves out of committing suicide unfortunately there is no life without meaning or if there is its a deeply unhappy one this is what camus was trying to convey in the last line that despite this hopelessness you should be hopeful anyway almost as if to spite the universe but i tend to think of this sort of like telling someone who is clinically depressed to keep their chin up it just doesnt work that way you must have a reason to be hopeful and camus offers none in my view camus doesnt offer any solace with this approach and is just sidestepping the entire issue
the myth of sisyphus is extraordinarily readable as philosophy goes this isnt kant its language is passionate and lyrical camuss voice is clear and direct if youre struggling my best advice is to keep searching reading continuing to build up a framework of knowledge and contemplation and come back to it later even then no ones saying you have to understand everything youre only a brainlet if you dismiss the book because its path to entry intimidates you    you can try reading nausea by sartre which although a work of fiction is similar to the stranger while being more openly philosophical the two authors were practically thinking in parallel until the end of world war 2

of all the people to get triggered by why jordan peterson
  but reddit loves him
  who would you suggest
  i wish i was jordan petersons girlfriend
dude great mother lmao
  i honestly cannot tell at all if the people on this board bitching about peterson are postmodern sjws or altright its amazing how similar you two faggots are
  holy fucking b a s e d
there is a disconnect in artsy /philosophy /fictionreader types    they deal with the subjective pretty much all of them are pseuds without any objective standards indicating theyre good at anything beyond creating something that other people like then justifying it as intelligent through some backwardsass rationale to pretend to be smarter essentially these people are gamblers except when they win the dice roll they try to explain how its their secret and intelligent method of wristflicking that made them win of course this cant be replicated consistently and everyone has their own secret method for getting the right dice roll     peterson says stuff i disagree with i hate this idea that so many people like him have especially the religious who say that there must be a solution to every problem the problem is that people fail to find meaning in life people like peterson say there has to be a solution there doesnt i also hate when people pretend theyre purely logical yet make arguments from a moral perspective about what benefits all humans or society and pretend that its fundamental logic     regardless most of the critics of peterson are the first type of people i mention artists people who consume fiction and feel enlightened for doing so theyre all pseuds who deal with subjective systems and feelings and emotions every day they create little hives of thought a bunch of morons trying to be more cultured and cosmopolitan than the next then they enter politics and genuine argument and actually believe their arguments are to be taken seriously when theyve never had to compete in an obejctive system they spend their entire lives consuming makebelieve stories then feel as if they have an accurate perspective of life the deal with art where whatever makes them feel best is superior so of course theyre going to argue that whatever makes them feel the best is truth    i guess what im trying to say is that the critics of peterson tend to be artsyfag types but its interesting to me because peterson as a philosopher is an artsyfaggot but his more objective study clinical psychology has given him a more objective mind to make arguments from im also trying to say people who actually believe art makes one intelligent should have their empty heads stomped in
  someone literature related
  isnt this pure celebrity worship this modern philosophy movement seems more like selfhelp and hero worship than anything else
  a certain amount of this is pure unadulterated autism but there is an element here of a crucial mistake of petersons philosophy in being way too optimistic you dont tell the truth about who inspires you to your gf kek you dont explain to her why something works like she can rationally understand it you just do it
  because hes very popular
  you also dont cry when you listen to another men
  this has to be ironic right
  this is bait dont believe everything you read on reddit kid
  its basically tony robinson pseudointellectual woo but with a rightwing gloss
i realized he was fuckin retarded when he showed a picture of god with a triangle over his head obviously referring to the trinity and he interpreted it as the illuminati pyramid and went a giant rant about pyramids
  correction i meant tony robbins not baldrick
  peterson isnt really rightwing but he sure loves taking advantage of right wing people which is just a shame
  its like the ingas and the farwanese man
    hes saying you cant even critique what he says so youre just ridiculing him
  hey buddy    i read fiction i have several books by foreign authors on my coffee table i got an art degree    i think i know what im talking about
  and im saying you and him can go blow each other because i dont gotta explain shit to nobody capiche
  theyre both riveting conmen but at least robbins isnt sticking his nose in politics hes just innocently conning retards by selling them happy feels which is a good thing retards exist to be exploited
  people unironically take peterson seriously  topping of the kek
  i have a roommate who helps  my sides
he is a compulsive liar it is most clear on jre     jp will never admit he lies he just frames it as being hyperbole
gets asked an uncomfortable question  well it depends on what you mean by that goes on the long tirade that has nothing to do with anything
i hope youve all ordered your copy
jordan peterson is a koch shill    he recommends institute for humane studies cato institute and others on his twitter these are koch fronts    he started getting public attention at rebel media  rebel medias founder ezra levant did his internship at the charles g koch foundation then worked at the fraser institute the kochs think tank in canada it has received funding from daniel pipes racist islamophobic middle east forum  which has received funding from the donors capital fund  a blind trust started by and funded by charles koch why the layers of funding btw    he pals around with dave rubin koch funded    he has attended turning points usa events  tpusa receives funding from no less than four koch groups foundation for economic education generation opportunity institute reason foundation foundation for individual rights in education    also at this particular event was ben shapiro his show is sponsored by young americas foundation and they have also funded him to lecture at colleges and it too is koch funded it has also paid the likes of charles murray milo yiannopolous david horowitz and robert spencer to go to colleges
  thats not how human beings work we are continually subsumed into our popular culture and it guides us in ways that evade our perception jordan peterson at least in online circles has vastly eclipsed literary figures hes now the antagonist to dissenting ideologies because for them hes the top dogthink of it would any thread about a modern conservative academic get nearly as many replies
  you should see him denouncing taking any action on climate change

  who the fuck is robert spencer do you mean richard im gonna need a source for this
  and they have used that to try to silence a documentary critical of them  as well as to make tax deductable donations and of course the whole point of it is for philanthropic pr  lets ignore this and focus on soros instead  oh you    no i mean robert spencer      but it is funny that you confused him for richard spencer  one of the board members of young americas foundation is a james b taylor  he was previously the present of national policy institute  now run by richard spencer      all these claims and many more about the kochs are detailed there and they all have citations  the guy running that is a machine

everyone gets the same thing
  no same as anon above im also a poorfag
  id rather get socks
    probably im getting books for most of my friends since 90 of them come here and likely some new age stuff for my mom and maybe whatever thrillerofthemonth for dad
i wouldnt waste books on them
i got my mom the bible
  ok this book fucking slaps
  sure my brother will be getting frank millers sin city and blood meridian my father will find under his tree homage to catalonia and my mother will be gifted with a tome of the princess bride
probably not might get one for my gf
the ego and its ownfor me
democracy the god that failedto my friend
nobody in my family reads or even has the patience to sit through a movie
  hehehe nifty
  nobody in my immediate or extended family reads
    caring about holidays is almost as pathetic as caring about your family
it would be nice to give everyone in my family a bible for christmas but im the only christian in my family everyone else is explicitly antireligious and essentially fedoratipping so to speak
  hheh thanks for your gift anon ive never heard of don quixote but im sure its a good book
  i never gift books to anyone because im absolutely certain that nobody will read them
and i feel its absence every moment of every day its weightlessness is excruciatingly heavy
  nice work only 60000 more words to go keep it up
  well put it back on then
  hahahah kek
not editing your shit properly  i took my ring off the weight of its absence is excruciating
  its
  i took off my dog to the veternarian one last time for that final sleep and i feel his absence every moment of every day his wooflessness is excruciatingly heavy heres a pic of us might delete later
  what a retatd i bet you think its short for it is
how do i get into lovecraft
  just pick up a collection of novels and read dumbass
read his stories
  pick up this bad boy and read it from beginning to end
  and if you crave more lovecraft after going through that beauty then pickup either s t joshis revised edition of the horror in the museum and other revisions or this bad boy
crack
  dig up his grave and fuck his corpse in the arse
  was about to write this
  sip  now niggerman that was a real cat
  go through his stories chronologically if you dont have the patience for that then start off with the call of cthulhu the colour out of space the rats in the walls and the music of erich zann those four stories will give you an idea of lovecrafts style
  was about to do this
  start with his poetry then work your way up to his shortest stories and keep going from there thats what i did anyway
just find the most readily available text you can online or physicaland read  no need to delay  read some of his more famous/most often published stories and branch out from there
  whtz the sauce for this image
this is not complete or even close to it but you ought to read     the color out of space   the shadow over innsmouth   the call of cthulhu    the rats in the walls yes his infamous cat is in this story    herbert west  reanimator    at the mountains of madness    if at all possible go out of your way to find a copy of one of the collections edited by st joshi one of them has a forward by guillermo del toro and the other is pic related
    here is a pic of the other joshi edited collection i believe there is another collection as well which i dont have
  looks like a bloodborne comic
  this order maybe help you dagon  the shadow over innsmouth  the call of cthulhu  at the mountains of madness    lovecraft has created a world shared in his stories but works more like legends than complement each other than a single intricate plot in that order it is easier for you to understand this
  read some of his shorter stories and build up to his longer ones    the best ones i m o that ive read so far are the music of eric zann the shadow over innsmouth the colour out of space the rats in the walls cats of ulthar one of his shortest stories the outsider    hes got so many stories and even lesser known ones like pickmans model are pretty good fun
  this but skip reanimator because its dreadfully repetitive and was published as a serial so each chapter he beats you over the head with what happened in the previous chapter its also poorly written the idea is cool but really its not a very good short story    seconding all the other story recommendations though a good list would include the music of erich zann but everyone else has mentioned that enough times already
  read whisperer in the dark or whatever its called its probably one of the easier and more interesting ones
  dreadfully distinct
  so you guys like rick and morty and your older brother told you that the creature chasing them in the opening credits is cthulu and he was created by lovecraft thats why we must endure these threads about one writer of mediocre horror stories why dont you guys read some shirley jackson or something somebody who finds the horror in the seemingly mundane everyday situations
  its actually my little brother that keeps saying thats cthulhu but that aside theres nothing wrong with asking about the writing of one of horrors most influential and prominent writers i personally think lovecraft is great although im biased as i started reading him at 13 and that made me take reading more seriously    shirley jackson poe machen shelley stoker ligotti hope hodgson ito matheson blackwood etc are all great horror writers too and itd be cool to discuss them but op asked about lovecraft so its a lovecraft thread make a horror lit thread if you want but dont be a dick just because the thread isnt about what you want it to be about
i dont get it is there even anything to get
no pontius pilate is a pretty good story though
  youre too stupid for books thats what
  read faust first
  explain it then fag
  no youre a spoonfed dumbass and i love watching you admit that publicly fucking retard
  it means more if youve actually lived under communist russia or ever attended a satanic mass with a huge titted babe standing naked beside lucifer
massolit  bulgakov satirises on soviet statemade literary unions   master  bulgakov himself who wants to leave to france
  t liked the book because he thought it was badass when satans crew revealed their true appearances near the end of the book
this is literally the best book i have ever read
  you have to be 18 to be on this site
  im 27
  thats embarrassing
  whats so embarrassing about being 27
  i must agree op the book is practically my bible
  youre close to death
  youre close to my butthole
  hitler said that
  probably also the only
  you are announcing that you are breaking your jewish conditioning for many that produces a pavlovian response like that of the poster hounding you who lets be real is probably a kike which is from whom nonnationalist whites receive their emotional reactions to these topics but those of us who have like you broken that jewish conditioning wish you congratulations
  i recommend that anyone considering reading this book read the last five pages first he tears into the ignorant racists this is so unexpected and it shows people that the text is not what has been represented to them there is a lot of other good stuff but those last five pages are easy to find and five pages is an easy commitment for someone that is unsure about committing time for the full text
  just go away i dont want to read the word kike ever again
  the dunningkruger effect is certainly a big issue for this topic i forgot i was on /lit/ and almost referenced a /k/ tripfag as an example it takes a lot of work and quite frankly i like to see people read henry ford first to establish a foundation ford really knew how to frame an argument without hate or anger
  kike  this term is no more derogatory than nazi  which is almost universally used to label members of the nsdap or even germans in general i will agree to stop using the one term when i stop seeing the other
  yikes youre going no where in life old timer
    if youre going to read fascist literature pick an author who can actually write
  pick an author who can actually write  did you read hitlers view on this topic he makes a compelling argument
   ted is a boomer for going out of his way to say he wont read it
  commissioned by a woman
  this term is no more derogatory than nazi  jews dont call themselves kikes like actual nazis call themselves nazis its strictly an insult and you should stop using it
  its really really bland does the mystique behind nazi germany no justice
  actual nazis call themselves nazis  the actual nazis never called themselves nazis jews called them that just as jews today call nazis any white that expresses common sense reactions about stopping jews from inviting infinity muds into their countries no white should ever refer to themselves or the german national socialists by that term though a few do hut theyre either retards or they do it ironically
  national socialists calling themselves nazis is like thinking the union called themselves the yanks
  the union doesnt have a bunch of modern larpers who fap to anime cuck porn
  op here sorry i meant to post this version
  lmao this was a damn good bit well done
  good analogy       you have to go back
  only the people that hitler addresses during the last five pages of his book call themselves nazis  much like niggers call themselves niggers if you are truly ignorant on this topic then you should look into the subject the fact that they are universally referenced as nazis is telling regarding the bias that is present regarding the topic
  does the mystique behind nazi germany no justice  kek  it dispels the mystique that never should have been mystique is just a fancy synonym for bullshit
  the union doesnt have a bunch of modern larpers who fap to anime cuck porn  what if they did how would that change anything
  good analogy  there is a pretty solid history of this though yankee was a pejorative term  now we have the new york yankees christian was a pejorative term  now most christians would struggle to find a term to better describe themselves outside of sect designation nigger was a pejorative term  now it is the most frequent appellation that i hear them use for themselves cop was a pejorative term  now they frequently selfdescribe as cops
  this book was commonly given as a graduation present to young men in prewwii germany i heard
  should be given out internationally for graduations today
12 rules for lebensraum
  the party was a shooting star  much more so than the afd is today a lot of people wanted a splinter of the true cross hitlers speaking engagements had a lot to do with driving the popularity he specifically discusses this topic of the spoken word driving discourse versus using the written word in garnering popularity
  interesting i think ill watch gsnt again
  you got graduated uh
  he talks about it in vol 2 chapter vi
  whatever you did on saturday night  if the newspapers are not screaming about it on monday morning  you failed to do your job
  you must not read much
    yikes
  yeah i can see why it was such a success at the time
  sad
    hes probably more well read than 95 of the people at his age
  it also flopped spectacularly in a prenazi germany before people were forced to buy it 
  oof
  why are poltards so fucking stupid
  those poor nazis
  it truly is an amazing book
  now this international type of jew this grasper after worldcontrol this actual possessor and wielder of worldcontrol is a very unfortunate connection for his race to have the most unfortunate thing about the international jew from the standpoint of the ordinary jew is that the international type is also a jew and the significance of this is that the type does not grow anywhere else than on a jewish stem there is no other racial nor national type which puts forth this kind of person it is not merely that there are a few jews among international financial controllers it is that these world controllers are exclusively jews that is the phenomenon which creates an unfortunate situation for those jews who are not and never shall be worldcontrollers who are the plain people of the jewish race    youre right what i like about ford is that he makes a big point to emphasize that many jews are innocent and have their reputations damaged by this very dangerous and power hunger minority poor regular jews are just as much victims to these blood suckers as nonjews are
  poor regular jews are just as much victims to these blood suckers as nonjews are  inferior people are always victims
  poor you
  this brings another difficulty in discussing this group of worldcontrollers under the name of jews and they are jews it is not always possible to stop and distinguish the group of jews that is meant the candid reader can usually determine that but the jew who is in a state of mind to be injured is sometimes pained by reading as a charge against himself what was intended for the upper group then why not discuss the upper group as financiers and not as jews may be asked because they are jews it is not to the point to insist that in any list of rich men there are more gentiles than jews we are not talking about merely rich men who have many of them gained their riches by serving a system we are talking about those who controland it is perfectly apparent that merely to be rich is not to control the worldcontrolling jew has riches but he also has something much more powerful than that
  some of them are pretty clever the missionary types tend to be dumb as rocks though
  lol name one
  there is no such thing as an innocent jew
    but another fact would intervene namely that these worldcontrolling jews are not notably religious and still another fact would hammer for recognition namely the most devout believers and most obedient followers of the jewish religion are the poorest among the jews if you want jewish orthodoxy the bracing morality of the old testament you will find it not among the successful jews who have unitarianized their religion to the same extent that the unitarians have judaized their christianity but among the poor in the side streets who still sacrifice the saturday business for their sabbath keeping certainly their religion has not given them worldcontrol instead they have made their own sacrifices to keep it inviolate against modernism
  inferior people dont ask to be born from inferiors reproducing and then be poorly raised by said inferior people
  cool define inferior
  cool define inferior  i cant because im inherently inferior
  then how do you know
  theyre anonymous anon  
  then how do you know  oh i guess its when i compare myself to others and see how inferior i am to them in lots of ways like intelligence and wisdom and spiritually etc etc etc etc  i dont know why inferior people keep on reproducing its very cruel to create such inferior life and not raise them properly  dunno if genetics contributes to intelligence maybe broadly with outliers eugenics when
  im insecure so the nazis were right    lmao get laid
   insecure so the nazis were right  im not a nazi i never said anything about the nazis i just clicked on this thread because i knew it would be entertaining like this race thread on here recently    maybe gene editing with financial incentives for the poor/unintelligent
  poltard then 
  poltard then   afraid not no   i dont really think all of my problems are due to da joos or tyrone stealing my women
  quote required
  you dont really think much at all do you
  sad
  i dont know why inferior people keep on reproducing its very cruel to create such inferior life and not raise them properly
  also i cant actually define what inferior means    ah
  he says that writers r gay and that the real gs are the orators kind of a bad excuse if you ask me
  wowzers
  but even his speeches are braindead bullshit goebbels journals more or less confirm that is there a more cucked mindset than the eternal polfag
  the entirety of chapter 6 in volume 2 is dedicated to illustrating the importance of live speaking over printed text he never considered himself a good writer  nor did he consider it important   i quickly learned that it was important for me to knock the weapon of reply from my opponents hand at the very beginning we soon noticed that those who challenged us in open forums shared a very definite repertoire of constantly recurring objections page 386 of ford translation  they identified marxist objections to their own ideology and tailored responses on the spot this was not something that could be done by printing press in their era further they denied the open ground of public venues to marxist logic anyone that desired to do so could see countergerman marxism get publicly disassembled because the marxists were working off of canned responses rather than being masters of their own ideologies hugboxing was likely responsible for a significant part of the failure of marxism to defend itself in the public arena
  countergerman marxism  good term for it highlights what jews do as an internal enemy to obtain power which many have noted for ages creating a countertradition that is the opposite of the hosts traditions    there are natural hierarchies in european societies that formed for a reason and allowed for general stability jewish marxism was designed to pull on those divisions and unweave the fabric of society to create chaos because that is the environment the jew strives in and it continues today less along class lines and more along racial lines as those jews flood us with more nonwhites    hitler had his faults but he recognized what a malicious force jews were and his zeal in stepping up and trying to take care of the problem is noble jews are a sick and twisted inbred tribe from the middle east and they have done unforgivable harm to our culture and civilization
  but even his speeches are braindead bullshit  then how do you explain how he was able to tailor his speeches such that he packed successively larger and larger venues with interested audiences are you judging the speeches by how well he is able to convince you of his argument rather than how well he was able to convince the audience that was in front of him in his own era if so you are not applying the same measure of success on him as he applied to himself he was successful according to the standard of gathering the will of his people and attaining power jews dominated the press in germany at the time so regardless of how good of a writer the nsdap might have mustered their written voice would have been squelched the marxists could not contain the spoken word  goebbels journals more or less confirm that  goebbelss journals really only confirm that the two men disagreed on how best to forward the party goebbels was likely incapable of garnering the popularity for the party that hitler proved capable of doing ultimately when the faction that goebbels originally supported faltered he fell in line behind hitler  tldr hitlers political success irl is a better measure of his ability than the petty ramblings of a party competitor that were recorded in a diary
  theres a fucking dictionary definition two clicks away and a couple of keyboard strokes
  highlights what jews do as an internal enemy to obtain power  see ford translation page 270  he then changes production into an object to be bought and sold by barter and exchange this robs the factory workers of personal ownership with the introduction of the jew the split between employer and employee occurs for the first time this later leads to political class resentment  this observation of marxism at work demonstrates hitlers love for the worker whether one believes such love to be real or feigned a solid look at marx really shows nothing but contempt for both the worker and the employer they are both pawns to him in the modern era we really only see marx presented as the protector of the worker and others as protectors of industry hitler is the only writer that i have seen give equal measure to each  though in practice he leaned pretty heavily towards industry i would like to be able to see how the workers would have fared under the nsdap in a peaceful postwar period   hitler had his faults  he did unironically lie about a lot of things which puts us in an awkward position historically in having to sift the truth from the lies the greater part of his work is truthful and a sincere review of the facts bears witness to the ocean of lies arrayed against him i weigh the fault of his lies on whether or not he could have succeeded in attaining and wielding power as well as he was able without countering marxist lies with his own
remember how donald trumps exwife said he used to have a copy of mein kampf on his bedside table and read extracts to her the government hushed that story up pretty quickly what a joke of a democracy we live in
  literally the best shitpost i have ever read
  hahahahaha thats bullshit but would be fucking hilarious if it actually happened   honey please stop reading mein kampf to me i literally dont care
  caring or taking word of what someones exwife has to say about anything    pretty based if true though
  remember how hitler warned that americas democracy would not survive the war if we invited ourselves into it    i do not see that it has really been hushed so much as it really is not so much of a story how big of a story should it have been if there were a revelation that obama had read marx
  hitlers love for the worker whether one believes such love to be real or feigned a solid look at marx really shows nothing but contempt for both the worker and the employer  we probably disagree about the role of capitalism here but this gets to the fundamental difference between whites and jews you will find a natural noblesse oblige from any sane european leader toward those below him but you will never see that from a jew the jew is hostile and roams and parasites off of others because it cant build or sustain anything on its own the jew can only destroy what others have built
  we probably disagree about the role of capitalism here  please elaborate for my reference
  yikes
  not an argument
  i think part of me was assuming rightly or wrongly that you might be in the capitalism is an extension of jewery camp but thats minor either way i agree with what ford said and what you said 100
so this is 4channel
  neither is this is literally the best book ive ever read this isnt a debate you see i reiterate yikes
  i think part of me was assuming rightly or wrongly that you might be in the capitalism is an extension of jewery camp  if you are only allowing pure capitalism into the evaluation then you would be right i believe the term free marketeer would better describe me capitalism without limits would justify marxs assertions though i know not how it should be attained best there needs to be a check on capitalism to avoid its natural descent into oligarchy i doubt there to be a permanent solution
  you just derailed yourself your original assertion of yikes was against his declaration of his age  not against his evaluation of the text i fail to see the defect of his age is he too old or too young and why would it matter
  so this is 4channel  yes  we are all oldfags now
  whats it about anyway
  its literally just a disorganized autistic rant about german politics of the time very infrequently does he even talk about jews
  whats it about anyway  well there is  his evaluation of the rhetoric supporting versailles sanctions  his evaluation of the value of the spoken word versus the written word  his propositions for maintaining societal integrity and his analysis of marxism  his concerns regarding public health and education  his belief in the necessity of nationalism  the importance of propaganda from the view of someone who was willing to call it such  his analysis of the argumentative techniques used by willful liars  analysis of jewish crypsis  his opinion for the need for lebensraum  there is more but i believe to have covered most of the important parts
                thanks for bumping this epic redpill thread and making /lit/ more better guis
  sad
  just a disorganized autistic rant about german politics of the time  not understanding the methodology of the recording of the text lends one to naturally believe this it was transcribed by a secretary while he spoke each chapter is typically a speaking session he treated each speaking session as if it were in a public forum with a specific audience so he felt the need to establish context each time because of all of this there tends to be repetition reading it without this understanding certainly makes it look like an autistic repetitive rant
  is the sequel worth reading
  each chapter is typically a speaking session  you mean an autistic rant session
  if i remember correctly he also covers architecture the value of exercise and the effects of a sedentary lifestyle among the youth the dangers of marxism and the problem with unions also a big part of the book is biographical
  digits confirm
shitposter  welcome my old friend   youve come to bump my thread again  when it was in most fear of dying   there you were just to pretend crying  as if you shitposter were in genuine pain  twas all in feign  working to reeeeeaeeeeach bump limit    and when i need to drop a log  nearly tripping oer the dog  sitting comfy on my pearly throne  but not before you are tossed a bone  there you are typing madly  yikes and sad and such  so thank you much  working to reeeeeaeeeeach bump limit    up and down the thread i scroll  accusations were from /pol/  but what it is i reeeead desu  we barely even named the jew  ideas we pondered  they were many in the sum  oh what youve done  working to reeeeeaeeeeach bump limit
  cheked and panzerschrecked
is this just pure german autism love that shit for a nice laugh
  it certainly is mein kampf is a great book no doubt but it is also pure autism
  it is also pure autism  can you elaborate on what you are calling autism i certainly agree that there are repetitive portions but i believe that they are present on account of the fact that the text was dictation based what other aspects strike you as being autistic
i would like to read it just to have read it for once but not sure how smart that is as i could get in legal trouble here  t austria
  is it just me or has the /pol/ and /leftypol/ posting on /lit/ died down a bit since we had the 4chan/4channel split
  i see a difference also  but i do not really subscribe to the /pol/ paranoia that is frequently exhibited here low quality posting is not solely the fault of /pol/ consider who else is on the other side of the chan/channel split besides /lit/ was declared as a target by the marxists before they even had a solid footing on /pol/
  here in the usa we have free and ready access to it the only barrier to it is the social stigma that is attached to it  which is very heavy it is quite telling that someone in austria would fear legal repercussions just for reading a political text i would unironically take a vacation in a country that was more lenient and read it in my spare time if i had to do so good bad or otherwise  it is one of the most important political texts in your countrys history
  seriousness  autism    hitler was the ultimate seriouspoaster
  yeugch thats a no from me my man
  based /lit/ is a majority esoteric hitlerist board so you will fit right in with us anon
  it is quite telling that someone in austria would fear legal repercussions just for reading a political text    not once one understands jews it isnt semites are totalitarian in nature and lack the objective nuance of europeans so they always try to outlaw any speech that is negative about them or that questions their myths it is why the two groups are incompatible and why we must unroot them from the west
  this i legitimately believe in a spiritual reunification with hitlers essence hidden in the ice of the arctiv
  it is certainly in my top 10  pure romantic idealism free from pseud pedantry and a plan to implement it that couldve worked with some geopolitical tactical adjustments and maybe some diplomatic pragmatism truly a remarkable work that sadly very few give proper credit to
  the gaping hole left for me is the economics it was always a weak point for hitler and he had no overarching plan in place when he wrested control of the nsdap he abandoned their socialist economic policies  which were little more than a milquetoast rehash of marxism this is the source of the myth of hitler being a socialist  the fact that he headed an organization that had originally intended to institute socialism
hitler thread on /lit/   f3 joachim  0 results  the best hitler biography ever written is by joachim fest heres the english version  
  yikes
  eh
  not really hitler autism about rearmement mean that its coubtry would have collapsed on its own even if he didnt start a war to pursue his idiot dream
  tldr hitlers political success irl is a better measure of his ability than the petty ramblings of a party competitor that were recorded in a diary  its very likely the diary is also intentionally altered or completely fabricated usa did the war crime of confiscating all german bureaucracy and ussr did the same     its made more dubious by the fact that the holocaust is the only genocide people react to giving reason to think its more of a psychological weapon or advertisement than a serious event
  hitler had plenty of rivals among the german ranks i think we would have seen some faustian caesarism
  usa did the war crime of confiscating all german bureaucracy and ussr did the same     the stormfag really do cry as he hits you
  probably also only book you have ever read
  epic burn bro
  i generally disagree with the premise that the goebbels diary is fabricated the contents are consistent with events consider the fact that he was aligned with röhm in the early days rather than hitler conflict within the party was very real as evidenced by the night of the long knives
  good try satan  but everyone here is familiar with the external direction of germanys destiny that was designed to orchestrate a collapse without rearmament hitler would never have been able to negotiate his way out of versailles
  man as an highfunctioning autist i cant help but note that im stuck trying to figure out the selfesteem step and skipped love and belonging entirely    how the fuck do you obtain selfesteem without love and belonging how do you obtain love and belonging without selfesteem its like an endless feedback loop of angst
  how the fuck do you obtain selfesteem without love and belonging how do you obtain love and belonging without selfesteem its like an endless feedback loop of angst  there is an old romanian proverb  if you have three carrots stuck in your ass then you pull them out one at a time  your initial premise is a loop  so lets segment it  how the fuck do you obtain selfesteem without love and belonging  and  how do you obtain love and belonging without selfesteem  now having two separate targets to attack we can choose one both or neither at our leisure if you are really an autard like i am then looking at it as a list will likely serve you better than facing a coherent system that is arrayed against you i chose the second selection and abandoning all hope after years of effort i had a painful catharsis i was never going to fit in the machine like the other gears i stopped caring and went my own way  specializing in an activity that attracted attention once a level of mastery was achieved my choice was unimportant  find your own others chose to associate with me because of the expertise that i possessed  and the act of being a mentor naturally built selfesteem i eventually pushed both selfesteem and external esteem to the side as unnecessary distractions and the cycle was broken i hope this helps stand fast brother
  pretty lame diss brother
  shut the fuck up kike
  anti hitler thread has tranny shills  really makes you think
  lol
    dont speak in terms so vague you stormniger  rearmament had nothing to do with versaille reparation the original plan by the previous republic was to borrow loads of money from american banks at generous interests america seeing that germany would never be able to repay such a debt was forced to intervene on behalf of its banks and to negotiate a reduction of the war reparation with france and the uk those two countries jumped on the occasion to ask for a reduction of their own debts to america germany gamble worked to an extant but the following western economic crisis made them default on war reparation france and uk also defaulted on their americans war debts of course it wasnt as simple as that and germany still had a fraction of the reparation to pay toward countries who could economically strongarm them but my point is that rearmament autism had nothing to do with throwing off the versaille debt    in the end
  ehhhhhhhhhhhh
  hating someone for supporting a genocidal organization from wwii is the same as hating them for their race
  genocide  actually falling for that lie  yikes
  you really cant visit this board when high schoolers are enjoying the weekend by posting their alt righty shit on 4channel
  rearmament had nothing to do with versaille reparation  hitler would disagree with you  as evidenced by his theatrical display with the railroad car regardless what do you think about austrias debt being canceled while germanys was not
  i am not the one filled with hate i will leave that to the jews  supporting a genocidal organization from wwii   this is one jewish narrative  that all germans were evil because they openly supported extermination of the jews there is also the other jewish narrative that the extermination was super secret  thus explaining the lack of documents supporting the existence of an extermination campaign if you subscribe that it is acceptable to hate all germans on account of your perception regarding extermination then where is the evidence of this open action also how do you support the legitimacy of jewish hatred for germans that were not involved in the axis campaign but instead fought against it  or even of their descendants that were not born yet
  lol okay pseud
  hitler was a fucking nigger that he disagree with me or not is irrelevent he would have touted his retarded railroad car either way because he felt the need to get his country on the level of the us    austria debt was cancelled because  1they were worse off than germany  2france and britains were mostly buthurth about germany      all germans were evil  thats not a jewish nareative thats fact grms shouldnt be suffered to live    huu were are the documents    you know you can find a tons of them just by googling right
  bread pilled to the max include me in the tigris river boating forum sentencing
  thank you for revealing yourself for the hateful pseud that you are kim that our interchange started with you calling me hateful
  underrated
  
  nice too bad hitler was a closet transvestite you secretly harbored a desire for goering to plow his effeminate ass
  man i wish my ranger wasnt such a piece of crap id almost feel proud to drive it
based and redpilled thread
why did hitler think racialism was the counter to marxism
  oof
  he was into jordan peterson
  id almost feel proud to drive it  give trading with the enemy a read if you have interest in ford  in addition to reading his own works of course
  why did hitler think racialism was the counter to marxism  this was a real eye opener for me i cannot pull the page  right now but he articulates how marxism worked to create social splits where they were not already present multiculti is a great marxist tool   exacerbate natural rift between employers and workers   present socialism as the curative agent  import foreign workers  pretend rift between employers and workers is not fixable  only something to be managed  let rift between foreign and native workers naturally form  reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee  racism  pretend the racial rift was not predictable  and certainly not part of any plan  blame the native population  hitler had theories to address the employer/worker rift though they went largely unused  possibly due to wartime exigencies possibly due to pressure from capital regardless there will always be conflict adding racial conflict can possibly make the conflict load of the system untenable
  show me where jbp names the jew
  its in his esoteric work only close friends get to see it

  hating someone for supporting a genocidal organization from wwii is the same as hating them for their race  was this not directed at me
  the jews just happened to be behind marxism in his country its not the answer to every infestation of marxism only the ones where jews are behind it
  its not the answer to every infestation of marxism  how do address the assertion that multiculti is a marxist dc tool

goddamn spinoza is a tough read desu    t owner of norwegian and english translation of his ethics
  read more secondary texts and listen to youtube videos rebecca goldstein antonio damasio will durand and read stuff like deleuzes courses on him and lebiniz webdeleuzecom and youll get a more complete picture
translation  brainlet detected no wonder its so hard for you
norwegian  brainlet detected no wonder its so hard for you
im reading spinoza too can someone explain his parallelism for a brainlet please
  do you mean the world of thoughts and world of extension physical things 
  im no expert but it feels like you can just imagine two lines where everything happening on one line is simultaneously happening on the other one so its different from emergence in that one line doesnt causally lead to the other but rather everything is instantly reflected in the other line or something like that the two lines being matter and mind or however spinoza put it its been a while
  this i read spinozas ethics by beth lord alongside the actual ethics i wouldnt have understood it nearly as much without it

  if you dont like how you turned out you can change yourself its as simple as that
  you can change yourself    people dont change not even if they want to   this is a basic fact of life
  religion grabs people and changes their moral compass that doesnt mean they arent followers still but their inner guidance changes fundamentally
  lol clearly you have not lived very much some things in people cannot change that is true but many things can and do
  case in point myself
  this my methhead uncle wanted to change he went to rehab and a month after he was out he binged on meth again and beat his wife and kids
  duh you cant change after you burn out your dopaminergic nerve endings with neurotoxic drugs taken for recreation lol he is just some idiot pleasure fiend something that isnt even human people susceptible to drug addiction in the first place are the definition of npcs
  wife works in heroin/fentanyl recovery clinic your anecdote does not stand up to the data dartmouth medical finds that 78 of individuals who are administered suboxone/social recovery efforts after an od when they are dopesick have successful recovery over multiyear periods people can be shocked awake
  amsterdam stories  nescio
  rehab must be shit where i live i have multiple family members whove been to rehab only to fall back into addiction a few months after theyve left one thing ive noticed is how religious they become afterwards its like theyve been brainwashed
my diary desu
worlds end by tc boyle might be something like what youre looking for read it anyway because its my favorite book
  my wifes recovery program isnt religious its a nonprofit hospital based one    one thing ive noticed is how religious they become afterwards its like theyve been brainwashed    more to the point people can be changed in this case by repetition of a new moral code established as a norm even my drunkass pos cousin now knows his actions are wrong after aa even though he failed it
  literally read infinite jest
  and everything you said was wrong the anon you responded to spoke of meth not heroin or any other form of opioid
  ivan karamazov is that read tbk

  i dont know why the white sip specifically but when i once had been drinking the white sip because usually monster costs 160 euro where i live but the white sip was on sale for 85 cents because it tastes like garbage compared to the other monsters like assault and nobody buys them my philosophy prof who is 45 years old has a garage band with some other 40 somethings has his gray hair always geled up like danzel and always wears jeans and a black jacket and/or tshirt happened to see me and came up to me and told me rough translation mhm yes this is a good one i also like to drink this one so i guess take that as anecdotal evidence

i keep fantasizing about death very curious about what its like and what the most entertaining way to go would be overdosing is lazy thought about making a pitcher of margaritas with windshield wiper fluid because ive heard it tastes like fruit punch
thus ran arethusa from rivergod alpheus from phineus and athis the ironhelmed arcanum drinker down the river of foison
  very wholesome anon    this is a page out of my diary desu
  the day you start reading seriously is the day you become forever badly read
  well if it becomes too warm then lots of people will die and even more refugees will go to europe for safety though i do agree that making the population suffer isnt a good move you have to target the companies that are responsible for over 70 of carbon pollution
my one fantasy in life is to join be a wandering nomad who travels around in 3rd world countries visits the local churches  ideally catholic  and seduce all of the pious peasant women into sin im not exactly handsome at the moment but i intend to work on that so as to achieve this goal
  it would have been better if youd tried to argue with me all your tricks and tortures mean nothing to me except that you have nothing else to fall back upon i reject your god
i think im going prison gay please help
  anon you arent a drone you dont have to read the same sequence of books as an academic to understand something your literary journey is like a fingerprint  everyone develops in their own way read texts you are interested in and if that interest leads you to books that influenced the ones you like then so be it     imagine someone who exclusively reads both ancient and modern texts what sort of unique and interesting connections would that person make between the two despite that huge gap the possibilities are exciting im not saying do something like that on purpose  im saying that following what you enjoy will lead to unique conclusions and views which is what reading is all about
dont ever eat stodgy meat while drunk i should have learned this lesson last time
  black people arent all that bad
  sinful and pozpilled    if you can seduce them they werent pious enough hence your fantasy of corrupting them is based on an inherently narcissistic conceit

  oh is that right those peasant women would gawk at you like the deformity you are theyd mock your paltry looks and shun you they will flock to me and practically beg
  sending love your way anon youve got us retards on the internet
i wish i could get into dd i love reading about the lore about the fantasy races and classes and shit but the opportunity to play it has never really come up i think its kinda sad dd players are supposed to be socially inept losers but these dude manage to get together with 34 other losers and hang out regularly meanwhile im way too socially inept to make a single friend let alone enough people to fill out a campaign i am literally a big loser than the average dd nerd
  ive been hung up on this girl i love after she rejected me a couple of times so i went to the club for the first time with some friends during the night i started dancing with a 75/10 girl and started getting my hopes up that id finally get off with someone for the first time t 18 year old virgin she started talking into my ear but i couldnt hear her over the music so i just said back some menial chat about the music and how she was v good looking not that she could hear me either then she went off with her friends and i never saw her again i left the club feeling more miserable and hopeless than when i entered and i still havent got over my crush _ what do i do im so lonely
  those peasant women would 1respect me because im not degenerate 2 be much smaller than me meaning i could legit pick like three of them up and carry them off if i was so inclined which im not because that wouldnt be virtuous    theyd probably think you were a child or a dwarf and put you in a funny costume with bells
  just search for your local nerds gathering
  theres this shit called meetupcom i once went on a dd session there    i thought that im awkward and fucked up but i was the chaddest chad compared to those people it was fun    they were very accepting and chill
  was it a one off thing or did you keep in touch with them afterwards
  i could have but didnt i just wanted to do something ive never done before and was bored also i have no friends
  im a monk
  old people are incredible lucky  they couldnt care less no filter just waiting for death to take em
  i love my cat my cats pretty cool
  sounds like me
  gas them
  where
you ever feel like sluttiness and selectiveness is the end goal of female sexuality and this is going to come back to bite us in 40 years when the monogamy meme dissolves and half of us are still waiting for wives
  no because thats not how things work in real life
  were not all fat losers
i think one interesting consequence of the internet and social media is the space its given for the truly mentally ill to respire and communicate among themselves thats a pretty new condition in history    gangstalking for instance what is that but a meme spread from one schizophrenic to another across the country through the internet
    you didnt really answer the question at all just kind of got mad
  theres no question mark tho
  whoa
  us  i doubt any man with a healthy man is going to be bothered by women not being bound to the kitchen and most people care more about their work and passion than just having kids and being a good citizien  selectiviness  not how evolution works   dissolves  it has never been a thing  waiting for wives  marriage is a scam from the rings to the ceremony
  heh
  i never really mentioned the housewife stereotype and sexual selection is a very real thing im kind of lost here because youre fully agreeing with what im saying about monogamy being a dying notion
  my loins are stirred primarily by mental images
  fag
  it cant be a dying notion because it never been a thing at all
  i dont think you know what a notion is
  let me make it clear for you you will never get a trad gf monogamy was never a thing you are miserable the world is not
  i have this but im scared to see a doctor in case they tell me i need circumcision
  are you really that mad you didnt know what a notion was
  i dont have the balls to actually be a theistic satanist
i just watched a video of jbp talking about dostoyevsky out of curiosity and i dont think it was half bad
  buy one bro sleep is important
  embrace it dudes are fucking easy you will be drowning in cum ya whore
  ill start tomorrow
    thank you both i love you retards on the internet
all those people who are altright or socialist or tankies or whatever these days will inevitably mellow out with age it will go the exact same as it already has done many times people will just move on those concerns and just focus on their own lives and people will forget about the problems real or imagined until another generation picks them up in a new form to repeat the cycle
  exercise ltryptophan ashwagandha thank me later
i dont want to graduate from college in the spring i feel like im just starting to get the hang of things now at age 21 the only solace i have is the immense personal growth ive made during these 4 years but i think if id had that to begin with i would be much better off now
  control and alter your thoughts temper your desire
longing for the release of death like everyone else except i play the part of sloth in this endevour and the longing is more at thr front of my mind than other people with a more convincing satisfying part
the shutin drunkard that i am im reminded im not actually the loser i make myself out to be when i observe the fucking inane drivel and bullshit im not taking care of myself so physically not quite attractive anymore but im more confident and interesting than three of these schmucks  my secret goal seems to be drinking myself til im actually retarded to meet and match the retardation around me then ill have a proper excuse to be the sad sack of shit i am now    i have the demeanor of an oldie if i change nothing now my behaviour wouldnt look odd thirty years down the line if i get there    yep the agar for memes that is the internet space worries me    i doubt any man with a healthy man  heh faggot  the whole monogamous marriage is a useful ritual for securing devotion to offspring people shouldnt get married unless theyre gonna care the fuck out of their kid the presentation of monogamy still has its uses streamlines some social structures    word salad rambler but hes not half bad retards just hop on and make a ruckus on the meme train when it takes off lots of disenfranchised young men need the help he provides    not gonna actively kill myself why not stick around for the ride but dropping dead at any moment dont seem too bad to me
  the trick is to keep yourself constantly busy  if youre always reading studying working or doing whatever hobby you enjoy there wont be any time left for you to think about masturbating
  this works but then i start seeing fapping as the reward for a productive day lol
  yes of course    although the fact that you have never had convictions means you can never achieve wisdom only a simulacrum
  me too
thirteen years ago i dryhumped a girl against her will while i was drunk at a mutual friends party i was 15 years old and thought it was funny until it turned out that it wasnt    its been a constant source of shame and guilt ever since it keeps me awake at night to this day
a sunflower leaves its shadow behind as it faces the sun headon
  you will never get famous so no reason to worry about hashtagmetoo
im getting bored of 4chan theres this pattern of me heavily browsing one board until ive gotten used to its memes insights or wtv then i discover a new board and the cycle begins anew the recent one is /sci/ after graduating /lit/ but that board is so slow so now im here thinking whats left for me 4chan is all ive had for the past few years in terms of online entertainment are there any anons out here feeling the same thing or am i just too old for this place im 22 soon to be 23 btw
i put down the technology bad thoughts fill my brain
  its not just the fear that it will be revealed ive recently started talking to my friends about it to try and get some perspective so it isnt as if nobody knows    i just cant get away from it its haunting me
today i felt a little better i havent had any thoughts of suicide i kept reading children of time and i enjoyed it my brother  wife passed by and left my nephews to sleep here theyre with my mother now  i decided to stop browsing /adv/ because someone posted gore there i hate that stuff it upsets me and ruins my day i will go to bed and do some more reading before sleeping
  i know how you feel i said and committed plenty of things i really regret while i was drunk some of it might even be considered sexual assault i found that for the most part people forget about it really easily or didnt even register it at all it helped my guilt somewhat knowing that even the concerned parties didnt feel as strongly as i did
  youd only need circumcision if it was really bad at the very most you might need a bit cut off not full take away
  made me feel better just reading this thanks
  can confirm i had phimosis as a child and had a circumcision and ive never regreted it no painful dick and it looks/feels better imo dont want to start another circumcision debate
  if you had a phimosis theres no question about it you gotta be circumcised
apples are momentary lapses of transcended hought patterns overlayed onto the halls of thought as memory is nothing but a preceeding transgression of atmospheric lens distortions onto a bandwisth exchange of fleeting emotions like how did we even get here dont quote me on this but science is a fraud and i think im nothing experiencing itself write whats on your mind dont stop what if i kept going maybe then id find the sentence to end it all last night i dreamt i was rushing for a flight back home to paris and went a little too far from the terminal and had to backtrack because there was a pond in the way and a land bridge a ways back but the plane was leavng so i rushed over the haygrass land bridge and slipped and was gonna ruin my nice clothes when a friend from a past life a fat black man offered his hand to me at the last second then i flew to a tropical island to sleep out of a makeshift hut but there were snakes by the shore and we had to go further inland yeah whatever just rambling like i really am just like one of yall its just i know my mind is free to not have any structure in it cus thats boring and fuck saturn
i have literally no passions or dreams ill trick myself into thinking i do but they never last more than a few months programming physics linguistics languages literature writing photography the outdoors math music traveling ive pretended to be all about all those things at one point or another but it was always a lie     i dont even know why i post here i only read a handful of pages every few days
do not bemoan your past by wishing youd started younger there was no one there to guide you you didnt know better now you know what needs to be done do it regretting the past is a poor use of your time make good time by living in the present tell your children this
  clubs suck buddy dont go there
  i havent been to this board since the 4channel split did anything change here
  just a lot more retardation but that might just be cause youre back
when will it be legal to hunt down people who watch anime and murder them in the street like the degenerate animals they are
  im also waiting for this day     but this website was   was made for anime   ok until you show me another site like this that is anonymous and interesting where i can discuss literature shoo shoo
  i dont like anime either but you are on an anime weebsite
    imagine wanting to kill your brothers because they consume media you disapprove of how lost you must be
  hopefully soon please cut off my head i dont deserve to live
i hate college why do i have to pay for a subject that i dont want to do and go in debt for it ill just get it free in the military at least then ill just hate the subject and not go out of pocket for hating it
  love you too anon wish i could drag you and the rest of the guys here having shitty days to a bar and buy some beers to bitch about life and books and get drunk together something about 4chan makes me feel like were the only people that would get each other sometimes
  youre not my brother scumbag and i unironically want to slit your fucking throat    i admit it may be irrational but the homicidal rage anime and the manchildren who consume it provoke in me is taking over my life
what the fuck is wrong with women  no seriously what the actual fuck three women in a row in my life just made absolutely godawful relationship choices and now theyre suffering and crying about it what drives a woman to do womanish things
  thats why you go to a college you actually like 
  stop blaming other people for making your angry and take some control and responsibility in your life for once
  but i dont even watch anime friend
  i dont understand this at all do you see yourself in them or something ive never watched anime but i view it as a sort of fixture on 4chan the fact that it is cringy is just par for the course on this website
  fuck you and your kind
i have an appointment with my therapist tomorrow and im very scared to tell him that ive been thinking about death more   appointment with my doctor wednesday and im scared to tell her that i think i need to change or add meds because my effexor isnt working   scared that my treatment resistant depression 21 been depressed since i was 6 my brain is mega chemically fucked might actually be bipolar disorder i experience extreme lows but i dont have manic periods so i dont know what to make of it  im scared of life im scared of change im scared of people hating me if i put myself out there i already dont have friends what happens if i never find any new ones 4chan is the only place that i feel comfortable  every time im on the highway i fantasize about going as fast as my car will go and slamming into a median or the side of an overpass and just ending it   i feel pathetic tired of this shit tired of feeling this way all the time
  
  hit a nerve
  you should kill yourself
  been depressed since i was 6  thats a thing
  you people are stalkers man no matter what why you try to paint it or how you try to make me seem like the bad guy here i just want to be left alone
i had my first prostate orgasm today id given up trying a month ago because i could not find my prostate thankfully i decided to give it another shot this morning i cleaned my anus with an enema and then inserted a buttplug to dilate it i dressed myself in a black skirt knee socks pink panties and a blouse and began perusing femdom doujins on exhentaipropping my legs on the corner of my desk i pushed the panties aside and pulled out the buttplug becoming erect i lubed three of my fingers and slide them into my anus searching for the prostate once that was located i grabbed my dildo which i specifically got in pink so i can pretend its a womans penis smeared it with lube and pressed it on my anus the immediate pleasure from having an object of that size inside me soon subsided and i began to read the doujin in earnest i tried wiggling the dildo around as i had done in the past but to no avail as i was beginning to lose hope fearing i would have to resort to stroking i leaned forward pressing the silicone between the seat and my prostate suddenly pleasure overtook me repeating that motion i started into the screen engrossing myself in image of a large breasted anime girl penetrating a man ecstasy
is there any way i can access academic journals without being a university student     im about to graduate and there will be nothing left for me without jstor
i like reading so i want to try and do some writing ive never wrote before what is a good way to start should i go with shorter stories and essays or just giver and go after a novel
sick of trying to fit in and trying to be normal sick of being angry and sad most of the time sick of not doing anything about it because of my mood swings ill stop caring about this tomorrow ill feel good once more until it happens again
  theyre literally raping me as i read this
  i just want to be left alone    you started it stay out of the kitchen
  download a bunch of shit now
  been thinking about it for a long time    according to my therapists thats when its started both my parents have a long running history of mental illness so it doesnt surprise me
  how did i start anything you literally watch me so much you use my life to make a point like a habit im going to kill myself im not even trying to guilt you or anything i just wanted you to hear it from me directly when im dead and you have no way of relating to strangers on the internet or life to reference in your anecdotes remember what you just said to me and the fact that ive been in this room for my whole life you really think what she does to keep me locked in here is okay because shes a woman
  i see them as parasites actively harming humanity by existing like weeds in a garden they must be found out drug up by the roots and tossed in the trash
  im going to do it man
  m8 what the fuck is happening are you alright
i have an assignent to write an argument paper and i am just stumped i dont know what to argue about ive written two rough papers about topics that seemed interesting but they just turned into bland statements of fact that i dont have anything insightful to argue about  tomorrow is a peer review of a draft and i dont have anything resembling an argument paper i know i could just bullshit something really crappy whenever we do peer reviews its incredibly obvious that the average person in the class doesnt know what theyre doing but that is just against my whole ethic and feels very intellectually dishonest
  im going to have more of an impact on this species as a corpse than you will if you worked for it your entire life in the grand scheme of things you will be remembered less than a piece of gum on the bottom of my shoe
  read  and stay home sick to give yourself another day
  implying
  do it in an entertaining way
  i doubt that seeing as youre an anime watching incel and i already have 5 bastard children
  based  checked
this piece makes me feel so good  
  bastard children  what did you mean by this not him youre arguing with
  i mean i am not in a relationship with the 5 women who are the mothers of my 5 children i refuse to pay them child support
  based any tips for avoiding alimony id love to have a few bastards myself
  what did they do
im dropping out of college because its boring and im anti social id rather be a wage slave for a few years and find something i enjoy i dont enjoy anything right now and the only reasons i dont kill myself are i dont want to upset my friends/family and i want to see the future i also dont care enough to kill myself
  well its a delicate balance of giving the women as little accurate information about yourself as possible but not making yourself a total target if you brazenly lie and refuse to answer questions about who you are the woman will try to get money out of you or worse not have sex with you in the first place but if you seem like a normal guy and its not until she tells you shes pregnant and you split that she realizes she doesnt actually know where you live or work or who your family/friends are or what your last name is    after the kid is born let her know shes lucky if you decide you want t see the fucker on christmas i tell em gabos game aint based on sympathy
  redpilled hopefully will impregnate my first woman next year
  the best target is women who are in relationships with other men if they are cheating on their men they arent as concerned about getting money from you because they have the cuck who is probably already paying for the birth control she forgot to take
  i know this idea sounds appealing to me because you have that satisfaction of spreading your genes and impregnating a woman without all that dad shit youd have to do normally do you actually keep an eye on those bastards    i dont know why but this image of me abandoning my wife/child has been with me for the longest time like i knew inside that id be an absent father
  not that guy but i have one kid i got that way the mom was with some cuck and the boyfriend quickly figured out it wasnt his but i havent seen them in 4 years in the future i will try to do them all this way if you have the opportunity to travel and live with relatively few possessions its easy af just dont have a facebook and shell never find you
                  you really ought to read jim you are literal niggers
  no thanks conrad was a slave morality cuck and youre probably an incel
  fantasy is an overrated genre people have no attention spans nowadays due to computers idea for a novel about dementia pride for a new decent ink painting
its 420 am where i live now and im tired af but i think i need to stay up another 15 hours to fix my sleeping schedule because my life is absolutely fucked and sleeping should be the first thing i fix    next is going out for some fresh air
  no ones talking about cuckrad pal 
come to 4chan that was designed from 2chan japanese board so anime is a key element inside chan culture to complain about anime    you must be very clever arent you
  muh website  muh safespace  youre manchild and you should be reminded that youre scum i know you probably arent capable of feeling shame anymore but you will learn pain your day is coming
we get only one life and of course we want it to be good the main thing we want is not to be alone so the best solution is in the traditional we gather together to join this man and this women together with the bonds of holy matrimony this is a somewhat bombastic version of what it sounds like        this is a lot of what it both looks like and sounds like        then they are no longer two people but one couple they are cofounders full partners of the one life they share these statements are necessarily true even if a lot of people deny them and ruin the joining bonding founding and partnership these statements are true because we only get one life and have room for only one really good marriage then a house divided against itself cannot stand    the central objective of the marriage is family formation being a strong limb on the tree why so we wont be alone so we will have family as the bedrock of the rest of our lives eg for connections with others with and via our children grandchildren etc    its a lot of work to do well with family formation and the main reason for work is just to support the family    with the marriage the couple gets activities accomplishments memories and traditions they like a lot dont want to lose cant get anywhere else and that bond them together traditions are really important because they bring good promise of some good times in the future eg us thanksgiving christmas big times at birthdays etc eg a good start on a christmas tradition is        with a divorce all those activities  are lost along with much of the life doing well at family formation is so difficult and the necessary stages of life are so short that theres nearly no opportunity to do well at family formation a second time so that one marriage is essentially the only chance you get get a divorce and have failed at that one chance and have destroyed so much that will likely never catch up    yes pop culture is awash in denigration minimization etc of marriage and family formation dumb    an enemy of the us or any country could hardly do better in destroying the us than to sabotage the us family i rank the problem that has no name as at        as the single most effective communist attack on the us ever done more damage than a nuclear bomb right it was written by middle class long island wife mother and accused communist betty friedan in her the feminine mystique sabotage    and its worked in the us and all the more advanced countries too few couples see the importance of building strong families and the birth rate is so low those people are rapidly going extinct literally
  youre manchild    i havent even said that i watch anime you are the scum here you need to release your rage on anonymous faggots on internet literally autism
have any of yall ever had a dream where you commit suicide
  whatever you say weeb scum just know one day i wont be confined to the internet and then well see whos autistic when my boot is on your throat and youre breathing your last
  tits and ass by anonymous    tits ass tits ass dick  tits and ass tits but not ass  imagine the smell
  your day is coming    yeah yeah people have been saying day of the rope or whatever for decades its never gonna happen
  i once had a dream where i was getting strangled but irl i was just choking on my own wrist
  haha damn thats pretty nuts but im talking about shooting yourself really i dreamt i put a pistol underneath my chin and blew a hole out the top of my head but walked around like it wasnt a big deal a group of people were taking a picture and when i walked by them i remember covering the exit wound like i was embarrassed by it
i cant concentrate on shit i need to fap i hate it if i dont get a chance to beat my meat on the reg i start either scheming on fuckin thots or start engineering bizarre masturbation practices in my mind which i then put into practice next chance to fap god damn it
  when i was a kid i would frequently have dreams of jumping off buildings or cliffs but i would walk away without a scratch every time and the dream would continue i dont think it was a suicide thing
  im confused why dont you pop a fat one and be done with it mate
  your subconscious is telling u uve lobotomized yourself with anime and 4chan and everyone can tell but u try to act liek a normie fooling no one
  ive heard falling maybe not jumping per se was about your muscles relaxing too quickly did you feel a little rush when you dreamt about it
i jacked a lot these last few days and felt like absolutely garbage suicidal today ive eaten almost an entire pack of brazil nuts and i can already feel the energy building up in my root chakra good shit    its like being on day 10 of nofap instead of day 0    these nuts are crazy powerfulcoconut water    dragon aura
  too many roommates around this place is swaming with street urchins i need to move some where with hardworking fobs who dont know what fortnite is then when they are at work doing a 12 hour shift i can wack in peace
  youre probably right fuck very good analysis i dont watch anime but i for sure spend an inordinate amount of time here
  we are not real  the world is not real  we and the world are nothing  nothing is real
  give me a quick rundown on brazil nuts is it like the guarana in energy drinks i chug a couple rockstar energies and its like a nofap multiplier 2 days feels like 4 and 4 days feels like a week and a month you will nut in in ur sleep
  yesterday i had a dream when i was with a group of buddies all armed like in call of duty and we were on a black road found a truck killed everyone inside and then i drove this truck down a really steep and curvy road we had so mnuch fun and laughed our asses off how i could barely keep the vehicle from crashing and the road was so steep and so curvy like falling off of a cliff of a mountain then it crashed and everyone died except for me ive seen one of them impaled on a tree or something oddly enough i couldnt care less about any of it
  that doesnt sound like suicidal ideation probably some other neurosis that other guys probably close
i wish i had never been born
  thats what im thinking because i dont consciously wish to kill myself at least i want to say the social aspect was spot on that im trying to cover up something to them but they can all see it
  they contain selenium and you lose selenium in your cum when you jack off also they just give you lots of energy make you gorny i dont know shit about guarana but i stopped drinking energy drinks because i fear my liver will die    those nuts and coconut water are good things to build up energy but in a spiritual way better than caffeine or meth or whatever
  its crazy how our dreams have almost slapstick like violence strange that you mention falling off a cliff might mean something
  im wasting so much fucking time i have a highly addictive personality and i always fall into bad habits its almost impossible for me to improve if i keep this up i will be nothing
  when my boot is on your throat and youre breathing your last    kek as i said literally autism
  yeah i wish you hadnt either but sadly you remain your best bet is to develop schizophrenia and treat the voices in your head like shit
  i dont think it was that ive had that rushing feeling sometimes as i drift off to sleep but in the dreams i was talking about the jump would always happen after i had been dreaming for a while it never came at the beginning or end of a dream always in the middle  i havent had a jumping dream in a long time so whatever mental state it represented has probably long since passed i dont feel suicidal at all right now but i might have had those thoughts as a kid and forgotten or suppressed them
  well see whos autistic    you when you sperg out in public
  hmm was there any hesitation before you jumped did you realize you were about to before it happened
  33 grams of fat in one serving    woah pass
  i have schizophrenia and its the voices in my head that treat me like shit
  you just keep eating hotpockets and watching anime dirtbag
  start bullying the fuck out of them
  its best to become friends with the voices give them separate names and personalities and just follow whatever they lead you onto    its fun
  nah because then they trick you into doing shit and cant let that happen no sir gotta tyrannize those fuckers
  i tried that and they led me to europe where i had a psychotic break and wrote all this and more      
  woah dude thats really weird because my voices also suggest i should move to another country
since were on the topic of dreams a few nights ago i dreamt i had a sexual relation with shelley duvall back when she was young and unconventionally attractive of course not the ghastly thing age and mental sickness made her into most of the details faded with time but i remember it as a slow and sensual sort of thing a dumb line i made about her hair stuck out probably a reference to one of the supposed incidents during the filming of the shining  i woke up uncontrollably crying buckets but not feeling particularly sad in any way similar dreams followed by the tears happens a few times a year but this was the first it was with a real person
  this one in particular kept busting my balls about reading english romantic poetry or hed send me to hell i made a deal with him and so far shit has worked out
  i have four different imaginary friends in my head one of them is the dragon from dragon ball and he likes when i eat brazil nuts and doesnt like when i jack off amongst other things
  is he polite at least
  from what i remember there wasnt any hesitation but it was always a conscious choice most of the time i think jumping was just a means to an end like getting down from a great height or trying to see if i could fly  again these are all faint childhood memories and im probably distorting them in some way
  no you when youre whistling through the hole im gonna put in your windpipe
  not really the other day i walked out of a shop and some guy walks past me and tell me to look where im walking and that i have no manners    i stareddrilled holes into him with my laser eyes dragon gives me this ability and screamed so the entire street can hear me that ill walk wherever the fuck i want and he should suck on my fucking cock
  either way the symbol of jumping from a great height as you said can mean any number of things thats one of those extremely personal ones
  haha nice showed the fucker whos boss have tried drawing him yet
when the schizo keeps bumping the thread talking to various aspects of himself
  glad im not the only one who noticed the shameful samefagging
  t another aspect of said schizo
  vronsky did nothing wrong
  i miss her so much just started talking with her again in the last few days for the first time in almost a year i cant tell her how much i miss her though because we dont live near each other and anyways she rejected any attempts at a longterm committed relationship even just seeing her online on facebook makes me feel something i know i need to move on but its so hard    shes just one girl and ive had others it shouldnt be this hard but it is anyways living the neet life right now certainly isnt helping with this and hopefully it wont last forever but god damn
  using facebook     lol
  shes probably getting plowed right now
  thanks for the support anon
  you cry on /lit/  while chad rubs her clit
theres this guy who bullied me in high school like really bullied me locked me in my locker wet willied me the whole 9 any way i ended up dropping out of school because he told everyone what he saw my penis looked like at the urinal and i cried so hard i had to stop going to school so i started following him home from school every day just watching a waiting for a few weeks just waiting for something to happen and i heard him say hes really afraid of clowns so i spent the next 4 years plotting my revenge i poured my heart and soul into becoming a clown at clown college so the day finally comes when i take my clown car and pull up with 14 other clowns outside his house just to find out from his mom that he died of a perforated colon now im just a clown standing in the middle of 13 other clowns with nothing else to do but jerk each other off about how great it is to be a clown and how are lives arent a miserable waste knowing if anyone who wasnt a clown really knew what we are and what we do we would 100 without any doubt not be branded as insufferable faggots who excel at being annoying pissants
  how ugly does a woman have to be to browse a literature forum specifically 4chan
  alright boys whos ready to be converted to socialism
  
  where do her braps go
i had an experience with this website today that made me realize a big part of 4chan is simply bullying autistics the worst of it is lightyears away from boards like /lit/ but within hellholes like /b/ and /r9k/ it reaches truly gruesome proportions no sane man should venture there it is the chaos wastes of the internet or at least an easily publically accessible route to the chaos wastes in all its noneuclidian horror    im almost 100 i am an undiagnosed autistic and that this is the skeleton key to all my lifes problems however im one of the rare highfunctioning supersoldier autistics who is able to weave it into productive and selfbenefiting behavior at times    but when i do manage to grasp my autism it is like a nuclear reaction of zena thousand fold lotus blossom awaking of capabilities in sacrifice for these capabilities however is the social world in all its grandeur and possibility like some great well of potential good and bad    im lucky im high functioning i genuinely struggle to deal with people unless they fit into certain categories generally i deal very well with anyone i want to have sex or mate with im very charming and human with anyone im in love with but everyone else i just assume they hate me even though there is no basis for it or i dont know how to think about myself in relation to them i dont know what goes on  the most troubling thing of all is despite being fortunate in having high functioning social abilities relative to an autistic i am such a loner it horrifies me i never join any groups or really have a big group of friends ive never been in any clubs or gay shit like that ive always had to navigate life myself which has been both a blessing and a curse    continued
  they inflate the suit and protect her from the republican agenda
  inb4 every rose has its thorn
  the cringbased dialectic has reached a tragic terminus where i do believe everyone at the mercy of that egregore disdains having to say the words but knows that it is obligated by a higher power and much as we grew sick of ourselves and our gods we now will soon grow weary mistrustful and maybe hateful towards our memes this is not unnatural but it cannot and by virtue of the inhumanity asked of people who depend on memetics to communicate will not feel organic or in anyway like the routine loss and alienation weve thus far experienced even in this age of alienations dismemberments detachment from the source of all that kindles the spirit of man inside of us something will be given that weve owed for so long and its beginning to leave our bodies and with its departure our power and last hope for irreverent spite will flicker out in this insipid maddening half twilight that our parents had laid upon our heads in the last two decades with the advent of a global consciousness and a global faith in communication over contemplation
  alright boys whos ready to convert to socialism
  im right to assume some people hate me because there is a lot of prejudice against autistics by neurotypical individuals im fortunate that i happen to be one that generally likes people because let me tell you a little story    a secret to the societal problem of mass shootings and other frightening events of seemingly random violence is that many of the perpetrators have autism there are numerous examples that can be brought up if you dig into the case histories    i feel a strong sense of responsibility and so i researched this problem i realized that only someone who is autistic can see inside this problem and get inside the minds of these demons and what i saw wasnt pleasant    i have very intense social anxiety but also the ability to defend myself in most circumstances many mass shootersif you investigate photos of themtend to be scrawny they are rarely physically impressive individuals     these two observations hold a key to the entire causal phenomenology of mass shootings     some autistics have it so bad that it is lightyears beyond anything i have to deal with lifedestroying cases or it is combined with mental retardation or other comorbidities one case i would like to discuss is adam lanza the perpetrator of the sandy hook killings    lanza fits the above criteria of being autistic and scrawny he lived out power fantasies in videogames involving guns and warfare and entertained a ridiculous fantasy of joining the military his mother was unfortunately not good at her job and did have the skills needed to detect the morbidity of his autism    when you are like this poor young man the world is like a nightmarish assault of pin pricks he was a highly intelligent young man and developed his own belief system    in one notable instance he phoned in to some sort of alternative radio station and described the case of a pet chimp that had gone wrong this chimp was owned by a woman and all was well until one day the chimp turned against her and brutally savaged her to death    lanza made an analogy that human life in civilization is similar the structures of control and regulation are like the woman who presumed she could contain the wild nature of the animal   to me it is clear that this is lanza making a subconscious reference to his relationship with his mother as his condition forced him to be coddled and contained his father notably was absent he could have stepped in that room smacked his son around limited his access to games and brought him back to earth  its very terrible to say these things about someone who is still here and had this happen to their family but it underscores the point that parents can prevent mass shootings if they noticed the signs   with the school shooter for the parkland massacre another dead ringer autist it is notable that he did it after his adopted mother passed away continued
  and didnt have the skills needed to detect the morbidity of his autism  unmoored from any sense of trusted authority he indulged his own power and revenge fantasy both this faggot and lanza were antisocial subtypes of autistics i can sympathize with that because i also have a strain of that in me but what they lack have is a desire to reach people some way and some how but not with hot lead lol although i do occasionally want to shoot people and absolutely would do it if the need struck my preference is to get along these extreme autists lack all their humanity like a dark souls character that lost all its souls theyre so gone its scary but there are good and bad autistics for some they have a deep and impassioned hatred for humanity because of the often real mistreatment they receiveneurotypical individuals are typically no pun intended prejudiced against autistics they are grudgecollectors and woundgathers and it is not their fault their brains are understaffed and undermanned when it comes to processing these social meanings they dont know how to deal with itit becomes another sensory overload and what do you do to something that causes you pain that you cant understand you stop itby any means necessary you kill it    take another example cho sung huithe virginia tech shooter another predictable case of autism this one a deeply deeply deteriorated and morbid case     in his case it is unlike lanza who believed he was actually liberating those children from the dystopian hell of civilization or that parkland faggot who was seeking simple revenge in chos case he morbidly intensely hated people his hatred was grotesque his crippling inability to socialize properly combined with his sex drive which could not be expressed because he was so offputting and unattractive something similar can be seen with eliot rodger although his autism is almost comparable to mine meaning not that bad he was just clueless and narcissistic    i could go on but it is tiresome to do so because the pattern is so predictable i am aghast that the government is unable to prevent this despite it being so blatant and obvious what the similarities of the conditions are    its just that studying this ugly sociological problem is so unpleasant nobody wants to think about it unless they have autistic superpowers    in all these cases the unifying pattern is an autist who is not properly understood or placed in the right environments and/or social antagonism and rejection real or perceived was introduced causing an aggressive response it takes an autist to know an autist so i feel i am being the hero by uncovering all this knowledge you too can put out forest fires and all that
  to bring everything together many of these autistic boys get fucked up by puberty they dont feel secure in their weak bodies so they reach for guns in order to feel manly they are compensating for a perceived wound to their masculinity because autism is typically so unattractive and being a scrawny bitch boy is generally frowned upon too     the relation of compensation between being scrawny and reaching guns is a dead ringer but in the case of lanza and perhaps the vt shooter their autism was probably so bad they couldnt even have gotten to the gym and had no hope of ever developing sexually
  if you were 10 more literate youd be capable of so much anon thank you for this
  what is it about inadequate women that leads them to believe they have any authority to evaluate the lives of down and out males to which they have no means of relating do they not understand that these men have been told that a beautiful woman is everything in this life that literal primary school boys evaluate their merit on the amount of girls they speak to its almost as if women are in a hugbox of their own creation a consequence of a system designed to create loving trophy wives for successful men who have submitted to the machine and slave away their lives working to build a better place for the trophy wives and slaves of the future the thing that really makes me angry that really grinds my gears is when these women coddled as they are by neverending stream of yas queens punctuating their every flatuelent quip and subtle dig at their vehemently lethargic and unmistakably less competent counterparts believe they have any right to judge men who actually know what its like to be alone and disregarded in the absolute its clinical really the way women eschew the qualms of these indefinite whiners with their infallible advice and completely alien ideas of responsibility and the gym what they dont really realize is that these men are fundamentally flawed in the way they see this world and its not exactly something that isnt affecting everyone the problem is theyre all alone and depressed waiting for a woman to love them because thats what theyve been told the end goal of their lives is and whether or not you realize it and believe me when i say many women do this is creating a serious imbalance of power between the sexes and people actually believe that women still need more support than men these people are bitter because this world is a lot harder for men than it is for women a lot harder and we have to do it alone its aspergers not autism
  im in

  cringe / based is almost like a deconstruction of communication it says nothing and is impossible to interpret in most situations it could either be ironic or unironic or neither
  i never join any groups or really have a big group of friends ive never been in any clubs or gay shit like that  pretty sure some people just get along better with small groups of close friends rather than bigger crowds  personally im mildly autistic too but im content with only having a handful of friends not everyone can be a social butterfly
  burger so its already cut off
  so like every meme   i love boom bust cycles of memes and when people explore the deeper feeling behind each meme
  i think letting go of the fact that some people are going to hate me really pulled me out of the place youre in now i act how i want to act not how i think others want me to act   a lot of it is chemical imbalance i still experience extreme lows and suicidal thoughts but the highs are higher and stay around longer  t manic depressive for 10 years
  i really fucking hate therapists to tell you the truth
  youre fueling this urge every time you indulge and strengthening it if you abstain and the trick to this is to actually abstain mentally not just physically youll find your urges to paradoxically decrease my sex drive is higher with daily activity than whenever i abstain after a week or two every time i ever wanted to satiate it by indulging say 4 or 5 times within 24 hours it made everything worse for weeks to come you really need to recognize this arises partially due to behavioral influences adjust your behavior accordingly
  i havent seen a therapist in something like 3 years but i have church and close people to confide in good luck anon

  im now done with my undergraduate studies should feel relieved or accomplished but i dont nothing really to do now except laze around for the month of december and then start studying for the gres and/or looking for a job i guess
  are frogs ever not rioting
  nothing really to do now except laze around for the month of december and then start studying for the gres  this  job market pays too low starting and youll just be struggling even at 45k starting go back to school   if you sit around you risk unemployment which will lead to deliquincy and default in your loans and make you ineligible for grad loans until youve made a number of payments especially if you dont already have a job lined up before you graduate youre going to struggle
i finally caved in and took some valium ill be at peace and not think of suicide for a bit  im going to rot in bed

  my life/job circumstance is absolutely fucked anon never had an internship my degree is oversaturated and too general to be worth anything without graduate level education and i just dont have much work experience in general loans arent a problem thank christ but they will be later im sure   hoping i can find a decent retail or even like data entry gig for a few months save up some money while getting everything ready for grad program applications     2019 gonna be scary for a lot of reasons
  i have not read a page in over a month i do not know what is going on with me    i matched with a qt italian girl on bumble the first day i opened the account conversation was going pretty well and given that i put on my bio that if you spoke italian i would take you to lunch also following /soc/ advice of not wasting time and being direct i asked her where she wanted to go to lunchi have not received a response to this day and i do not know what to make of it
  asking women questions    how old are you
  what the fuck does that mean
  if youre older than 18 and asking a woman where she would like to eat then youre hopeless
  not feeling emotion  hard    it sounds like you are feeling emotions just not positive ones this is why you dont self diagnose and try to fix yourself but it doesnt work when youre so far gone go see a therapist

  nigga im new in town and barely know any cool places other than springs to go practice apnea do you know how many women like to hold their breath for over a minute and go inside caves with a small flashlight    passiveagressive bitch
  in truth its very complicated and i dont expect anyone to understand unless theyve had it you see i do have emotions in a sense but theyre not like most peoples imagine a scale where the greatest feelings rise up toward ten and the worst approach zero my emotional range then is about 4555 usually hovering in the exact center and in fact is probably even less than that i can suffer in a sense but even then its not a fraction as bad as actual suffering faced by most people on the reverse side my pleasure is nowhere near to what other people feel each day is the exact same if i won the lottery theres nothing i could buy that would be really enjoyable or fun other than drugs     i dont really know how to explain it it sounds like typical depression yeah but my reward system is broken at the core i move from hobby to hobby and drop each one after a week because the thrills wear off i bought a nintendo switch a month ago and i didnt even touch it after a few days because playing the games was like a chore that i got nothing from i listen to almost the same music i discovered in 2015 and before because nothing since manages to excite my emotions i cant remember the last time i felt lonely my mom almost odd a year or two ago and all i could think was why dont i care right now    its hard because life still requires energy to run but i dont get any joy for all the effort i put in you know that feel when you facedive into a bunch of pillows after a hard days work and it feels amazing thats gone for me that comfort from the sound of rain gone orgasm now isnt even worth the effort and i can do 7 days of nofap easily because of it     maybe youre still not convinced its okay i tried therapy once it did nothing i tried forcing my emotions out with all my might  didnt work i wish there were more i could do but now all i have is the meds      ill try it when i can afford it
  try going 30 day nofap inst4ead of 7 and then youll see
  you did well anon dont worry about the woman sometimes they stop responding when it goes too fast or just when it goes somewhere for that matter and i think the other anon was on about some retarded pua shit like asking questions puts you in a position of inferiority or something
  i did 10 days recently why do you expect that to make a difference
  because one ejaculation is formed in the body for 30 days and thats also how you get your first drip of spiritual energy and feel deep joy love etc
  that sounds like bullshit
  whatever keep eating your pills and posting muh dead inside on lit faggot
  clean your room
  pills  not as retarded as spiritual talk come on
  id rather kms than eat some chemicals some jew gives me
im sorry but im not into any of your basados rotpillgeschichte gold mines nor any forest fires for that matter what i want is on my mind and way out on the horizon
it must suck to be a shot person in a fantasy universe that features the dwarven race they are basically your height but can bulldoze you physically and exceed you in terms of industry and determination    a short human might have a chance to beat a dwarf in the same way a goblin might but only if he is swift and stabby like a rogue

how many of you have ever published a book im curious to see if any of you have had some sort of success    i just published my first book and a comedy book at that on amazon of course not even sure if traditional publishing is even worth going after nowadays comedy aint an easy genre to sell either
  i got a book picked up by a subsidiary of penguin and its notnyet published but will be within the next few months signed a deal and everything cannot talk about the book itself yet but ama about the processing of publication
  good stuff lad cool to see people from here can find opportunity    not sure what to ask if im being honest what im most curious about is probably why they chose your book and whether or not you were surprised to have gotten it ive heard its quite a task to get accepted i personally have some doubts about myself
  how did you initially begin the process of getting your book published    how long was the time between submitting your work and being approved
  how does all of the legal shit about x rights play out in the deal process my first novel is about to be finished and since im trying to get it traditionally published in a northern european country id want to keep the rights to the translations myself mostly since i can easily make the english version on my own and that one might actually make some money
  he is not a psychiatrist period
these are self help truisms that have been around for some years already    but maybe hes original for being a crypto misogynist nazi on the side
    no hes a clinical psychologist aka paychologist who likes to scam people out their money by cashing in on their insecurities and also there is nothing wrong with post modernism judith butler has proved this
  that sounds like a terrible thing to be and he isnt even that
  cringe  and im no peterson fan myself  just cringe
  judith butler has proved this  only good joke about pomo ever made
  tfaggot who keep spamming jp thread with this baseless accusation    at least point to a specific part of what he say
    
  crypto misogynist nazi    weaponized word salad
    lmao
  t guy who wants good threads about jordan peterson    the saddest tragedy here is that if the dude had anything interesting or sophisticated to say then the threads would only be worse
jordan peterson is good
  ill ripe your neck open with my bare teeths you dog
  judith butler is a fucking idiot
hes just another internet advocate for classical liberalism or whatever they call it now its stupid democracy doesnt work it allows people who naturally only ever want all the best things for themselves without the responsibility to decide how to organize society it creates a society of base pleasures that ignores the discipline and responsibility he extols all the time
  he does have something interesting to say otherwise he wouldnt be as popular and/lit/ would simply ignore his threads
no peterson is a hack you want a philosophical psychiatrist try karl jaspers or ludwig binswanger
  democracy doesnt work  meanwhile all of the most powerful countries in the world are democraties
    baited
  this funny b8 too
  forrest gump didnt make millions of dollars because people were so fascinated by what made life so much like chocolate the appeal of clean your room or misreading nietzsche isnt that its interesting and worth dissecting but thats its bland and easy to repeat his celebrity is the most fascinating thing about him dont get me wrong i genuinely appreciate what a weird guy he is but even thats get old
i find it funny that /lit/ is mostly full of people like this guy 
  jordan lobster man peterson  jordan its too complex peterson  jordan what do you mean by that peterson  jordan hierarchy of competence peterson  jordan ideology i detest peterson  jordan better dead before red peterson    jokes aside i like this guy he is making people think he made me read and self study philosophy
  xd
  democracy has had a relatively very short life span and with each generation as traditions have disappeared it has gotten worse and will continue to get worse
both the genuine and attemptathumor responses itt sadden me this is a repeat meme thread when we used to have biweekly just bought this moby dick threads most everyanon was in the know and as a result actual humor emerged these repeat threads are just unironic cringe
  does the master not claim he is more powerful than the servant despite both being of weak stature      this is pretty much the way i view him any celebritytype is memed on here but i do like the fact that he is stirring things up a bit in the circle
  he is a nobody
when is /our marxist/ zizek going to destroy him again
  no hes a psychologist who likes to act like a philosopher
  the funny thing is that most people call him nazi but he also says about the importance of the left you need people to make things work and keep working but you also need people who see outside the box and find ways to improve the whole system he criticizes the radicals in both sides ironically /pol/ hate him now
jordan peterson is a philosopher and an intellectual and has valuable things to say that can improve most peoples lives if youre enlightened enough not to need him or find him interesting youre also far too enlightened for a malaysian hentai exchange so you wouldnt be reading this  the thing is jordan peterson isnt plato or aristotle you can read wiser people but there arent a whole lot of wise people alive today that have a grasp of an audience the wisest people in the popular culture are dr phil jerry springer and jordan peterson and jp is by far the most instersting and prolific and least moneygrubbing why he gets so much hate here  is not beyond me you fucking pleb its obvious there are a lot of fools and femboys and degenerates on this board trying their best to make everyone agree that their perversions are natural and our disgust is constructed
  hes a physchoanalitical pseud
  what does it mean if i unironically agree with this meme
  no you hes philosophically illiterate
  he connects a lot of ideas related to the research on personality psychology and the literature on deep psychology to such broad extents that he ends up sounding philosophical after all philosophy is concerned with the big questions with the deepest layers of our knowledge base
  it means youre capable of critical thought and not just another peterson drone
  its bland and easy to repeat    if its so bland why do he becames so popular why the adoration and the hate you dont get that by serving uncoocked pastas to your audience
  popular doesnt mean good anon by that logic keeping up with the kardashians is televised gold
  based core /lit/erate
  this  /thread  op is an idiot and so are everyone who are under this post including me
  just because a bunch of peasants can kill a king doesnt mean democracy is the end all of government
    this is the best thing ever hahaha
  part of his appeal for me was being a tenured professor at the top university in his country with a decently sized hindex aka an actuall successful person rather than some nobody whose literal job is being a motivational speaker
  hes become a demagogue of a sort an antiideological ideologue who likes the spotlight a cinch too much
i dont care about him if not just for the fact that his legion of misguided teens who look him up as father figure go around spoting uninformed bullshit about philosophy and its history
  shoo marxist
  references a female  references a dyke female  yikes
  shoo marxist    way worse
  cultural marxist
  just a psychologist with common sense somehow this is a superpower nowadays
  ya know its so nice to see you fags getting teenage dicks in your mouth      youre just mad that your whole thing of cheerek yur privludg ehitr boi is now ending get raped faggot
  jordan is my supehero 
i recently finished to the lighthouse and looking for something similarly introspective but an easier read does /lit/ consider sylvia plaths bell jar good thank you
which is better 1st person or 3rd person
2nd person
  youll always be first person to me anon 
  2nd person  doesnt work outside of short stories or epistolary novels      3rd person  this is the gold standard    3rd person limited  this is the most fashionable style    1st person  hard to write a serious novel in this style but it can be done you give up ironic distance from your characters in exchange for a deep dive into your main character this can be done to great effect notes from the underground but its usually not worth the tradeoff
  first person  read american psycho
  i refer to myself in second person and to other people in the first
  so are other people speaking or are you speaking right now
  all is one anon
i think 3rd person gives most flexibility you can narrate in omniscient style flaubert or unreliably thackeray or in the mixed free style there was an austen thread here somewhere first person is more challenging because it restrains the plot and imposes all sorts of logical restrictions i feel that most classical writers saw it more as a challenge though this is pure speculation on my part
      those also you need to keep in mind if you want more emotional resonance or clarity basically if you idea is more character wise then 1st helps if you are more about plot 3rd is better but there is not a right answer
  i dont like 3rd person if they are only going to focus on the protagonist and his thoughts in 3rd person always felt that it should be in first person at that point
reading something in first person is okay but writing fiction in first person is weird and i dont like it
  thats pretty gay to be quite honest
  1st person maximizes immersion of the reader into a character and is therefore best for letting the reader experience events of the story for themselves   3rd person is best for exploring and developing characters and that is what almost all good novels are about
  says this in second person
  this
  one isnt better than the other you have to choose which one suits the text youre working on best
3rd person is harder to write
  plural
  first post best post
he gets his finger bitten of by fucking gollum and he falls in the lava  5 or something more chapters of talking and talking and describing shit i think then it ends  its a really good book though so it wont be a curse to read the last few chapters but fuck tolkien takes his time   it was pretty ok for a fantasy book though

depends on your purpose and experience/knowledge with christianity for someone new to the faith i would say    new testament  pentateuch books  poetical books  rest of the old testament
  i mean they already went through the effort of printing it why actively seek to make it harder on yourself
  why do you recommend the new testament first how much would i miss by not having a familiarity with the old testament first
  because the new testament is all about jesus his followers and christianity the old testament is about gods covenant with israel and basically supplies greater depth and context to christian belief
old testament  new testament  book of mormon   doctrine and covenants  pearl of great price
  there is no best reading order the bible is so diverse that it depends on what youre reading for if youre interested in christianity the new testament is the easiest place to start reading roughly in the printed order of gospels acts epistles and revelation if youre interested in the corpus as a whole id definitely recommend reading the old testament first its fascinating in its own right and provides vital background for the new testament    its controversial to say this but id recommend initially skipping the more difficult bits of the torah first five books and then coming back to them when youve got a better grasp of the context below is a bare bones narrative reading plan of the old testament which you can supplement at any time with the poetic/wisdom books and some of the prophets    genesis skip 5 10 36  exodus 124 3235 40  numbers 1036  deuteronomy 34  joshua 113 2224  judges  1 samuel  2 samuel  1 kings skip 7  2 kings  daniel 16  ezra  nehemiah skip 10  1 maccabees apocrypha/deuterocanon
why read it at all
  paste and redbull    nehemiah skip 10  why
thoughrs on bataille
  i read story of the eye a while ago it was pretty good there was a funny paragraph about the animalistic sexual fervir of the negro
  redditcore
what are objectively speaking the best books in the bible
  genesis ecclesiastes job jonah matthew mark luke john acts
book of dawkins
the song of songs
  based god
  new testament
genesis and exodus  skip ahead to samuels and judges and kings if youre into all the fun stories about wars and fucking and all that  job jonah daniel are my three favorite prophets to read though people really deep in faith will tell you not to skip isaiah and ezekiel  gospels and acts  of pauls letters i like romans corinthians and the timothys  revelation obviously
  o god how did i forget ecclesiastes and song of solomon those have always been my two favorite books the psalms drag ass but some of them are breathtaking
  dawns in a retard
  genesis exodus song of songs wisdom mark luke matthew john james romans revelation
do people actually read the bible cover to cover
  acts is also good
  do people read the bible  yes anon
the ones which patristic theologians blotted out when they began to create a religion for the roman state
  implying theological significance  citation needed
  theologically its john and maybe romans  literaturewise its ecclesiastes job song of songs or revelations
  what evidence is there at all that christ espoused gnosticism  the earliest theological work the didache and the earliest christian writers the apostolic fathers support trinitarianism and orthodoxy
  well said anon
  skip ahead to samuels and judges and kings if youre into all the fun stories about wars and fucking and all that  i honestly felt that those were the most boring parts of what ive read thus far
shoukd i read about david and solomon before reading the psalms
what version/translation of the old and new testament should i read to read it as literature/canon influential work
  i might as well just list all 73 books man
  job
  matthew revelation and thats it all the books that make it clear who founded the faith and who it belongs to
john kennedy toole writes a confederacy of dunces  ignatius j reilly is a prophetic archetype of the average /pol/ poster  john kennedy toole commits suicide  his mother brings the manuscript for acod to a ton of publishers until someone actually likes it  he is awarded a posthumous pulitzer prize    im not really going anywhere with this its just a fascinating story
everyone already knows this story desuuuu
  ignatius j reilly is a prophetic archetype of the average /pol/ poster  no
  if i commit suicide right now and my mother submits my waifu folder to a museum it will be regarded as a modern day masterpiece  too bad i will not be there to witness the sweat of my brow
  hmm i reckon ignatius is more of a 21st century underground man hes a confused overeducated outcast of society hes a reactionary sure but his story is a parable about the folly of living a life defined by intellectuality the cerebral sphere and the teachings of dead wise men had he read different books his beliefs might have been in the vein of lefty spiritualism that scorns the modern world and exalts the past and the meaning of the story would still be essentially the same     a confederacy of dunces is a great book didnt really make much of an impression when i read it but now three years later i still have a clear picture of ignatius in my mind
how did the publishing industry get so fraught with cultural marxists
  cultural marxism is a spook no one wants to publish your book because its shit
  thats rather rude
adorno can tell you
  shoo shoo shill jew       in book publishing the newhouse empire owns random house the modern library knopf pantheon and ballantine books columbia broadcasting system owns popular library fawcett publications and holt rinehart and winston music corporation of america owns g p putnams sons gulf and western owns simon and schuster other jewish publishing houses are grosset and dunlap lyle stuart viking press stein and day grove press crown schocken books and farrar straus and giroux nearly all leading publishers jewish and nonjewish promote works of jewish authors and employ jews in executive or editorial positions     minority members are found in the top echelons of the three major commercial television and radio networks the public television and radio network every large motion picture company including the disney studios the nations two most influential newspapers one of the largest newspaper chains at least half of the important publishing houses the three newsmagazines and most leading journals of opinion
  wow wouldnt it be great if we had more women buy our fantasy shlock books lets hire more women editors  female editors are feminists  suddenly half of your editors are feminists  suddenly your board is full of feminists  suddenly your company is run by a feminist  nonfeminists get pushed out by shaming tactics and sexual harassment claims  demand half of published books are from women  demand more representation of anything that isnt white males  suddenly all book awards are run by feminists and awards are handed out based on race and gender
  its just a sign of the times the establishment is full of cultural marxists you will find them in every place of power what this means i do not know but it is a sign of our times
  your mother is a spook  how about you actually try reading something shill
  and  the same white males who made you money in the past still produce all of your profits  but now each one finances 20 award winning minorities who dont sell shit
  this is unfortunate that its emblematic of all of the arts there are some great things being made but america is culturally dead    cardi b needs to be raped
cultural marxism isnt a thing but i wish it was
  just a meme term for institutional slave morality
  cultural marxism refers to the exact same thing as intersectionality  ie chopping up society into oppressor victim classes
  same thing different level of analysis

tfw i work on a riverboat four weeks at a time  too tired to read on my off watch  only two weeks home  drink every night  too hungover to read in the day time  rinse and repeat  i wish i had never dropped out of college  anyone relate to this feel
yes but i went to college and work a 917 at an office where i have enough time to browse 4chan etc still find it tiring and dont really read or do other things  sometimes i envy people like you who work outside have technical skills and have full 2 weeks off so often not discounting your hard 4 weeks
  stop drinking
go homeless  oh and stop drinking too that might help
  i dont have any technical skills myself im barely adequate for my job i was honestly happier working at walmart but i needed higher pay         how though ive got a pretty weak will
god dammit dude are you the same frog from the college thread 2 days ago    what the fuck is your job anyhow what do you do on this boat
  what the fuck is your job anyhow what do you do on this boat  gator hunting
  please explain your workday what its like what you do what you hate about it etc
official top 2 novels featuring riverboats of all time    the adventures of huckleberry finn  love in the time of cholera
  he kills noble gators and thinks anyone should wish for anything other than him falling into their jaws at some point  fuck you
  based 4570 or 308 or what please tell me you work a lever gun from the upper decks of a river boat cigar set down on a rail still burning tassles onnajacket gambler hat and steely eyes    im jealous frogman
riverboat past gaiter and allens from swerve of swamp to bottle of booze brings us by a froggodius sickus of regret back to forth channel and environs  hang in there frogbro
    i should have been clearer i work on a towboat for a barge company       no one replied i need my validation to know how special i am dont you see      help put barges together i dont hate it its just exhausting dangerous hot as fuck in summer cold as fuck in winter
  drinking seems like more of a problem than being tired two weeks straight is a lot of time anyway i worked construction for the past two years and drank all the time and i have a kid and a wife and read all the time 4chan might be the real problem actually my favorite writer right now is william gass
  what about starting to meditate it helped me but consider it can take some time until you see results
  well im not drinking on the boat that would easily get us fired      ive considered it heard it helps with add as well but i dont know how meditating works
  take the tobacco pill
  im a noob to meditating but i would say you learn shit about yourself by observing yourself i do mindfulness / vipasana    once you gathered intel on yourself you can combat yourself better
  cries about nobody giving him yous  he ignores my post as if i dont exist

  my freshman english teacher assigned candide in high school i can probably find an old class syllabus somewhere if people dont believe me
i was reading about chomsky and ludwig wittgenstein and how they were into the study of language it seems like theyre just giving us trivial facts about language with no real world applications i know this is probably a bad and superficial look on my part but i was wondering if there is a way to exploit your knowledge of linguistics in people or is there a way linguistics can help you maneuver around the world in some way
  it could streamline learning another language in an immersive situation by understanding concepts of grammar and potential cognates maybe
yeah its called pragmatics    and studying phonetics is really useful to get a job
  isnt phonetics taught in primary classes because english is not a phonetic language
  how does pragmatism help also i think philosophy should do more than just help you get a job
  but i was wondering if there is a way to exploit your knowledge of linguistics in people  pragmatics is literally this how context and speech can affect meaning
  pragmatism helps with everything what you should learn when learning either linguistics or pragmatism is peirceian phenemonology and semiotics which will probably help immensely
    nice thanks for the help /lit/
i have written a novel of about 20000 words i know its short but i dont feel i need to expand it the story is complete as it is what do i have to do
  what do  call it a short story instead of a novel and then throw your rejection letters in the trash
  send it to publishers that publish short novels like off the top of my head melville house even those kinds of publishers would probably want you to expand it a little bit though from 20000
  the book is revolutionary i think it is going to be taught in schools and is approximately the size of animal farm
  besides revising and giving it to people to see if they like friends family known people inside literature start sending letters to publishers and things like that oh and call it short story maybe try to get two more of those you know keep practicing you are doing good anon
  its not in english
  thanks gryphon
  start with the greeks
  the novel is in greek since i am greek so you should start with me
  translate it to french and call it a récit
  write another one that involves a mysterious book  when a character finds the book insert your first novel  profit
i refuse to believe that anyone has read hemingway apart from hills like white elephants in high school    making my way through a farewell to arms its the absolute driest shit his sentences are repetitive in the worst way theres no rhyme or rhythm to his prose its impossible to speed read because of this i dont have time to sit and study a fuckin novel like i did when i was a lit major
brainlet
fpbp youre a brainlet op his prose is sparse love it or hate it it is his voice and no less valuable than yours assuming you could even write anything worth reading
  wait what is this guy talking ab  its impossible to speed read  oh hes a retard
got about 70 pages into to have and have not and havent gone back since i accidentally took a different book on the train wouldnt agree with most of what youve said other than repetition nigger was once a page on average but i didnt find it difficult to read at a fast pace at all and enjoyed how his straightforward approach to prose influenced the dialogue
 the town was very nice and our house was very fine the river ran behind us and the town had been captured very handsomely but the mountains beyond it could not be taken and i was very glad that the austrians seemed to want to come back to the town some time if the war should end because they did not bombard it to destroy it but only a little in a military way    this is what im referring to when i say its dry and repetitious everything is described in the simplest most unimaginative terms very nice it was ___ and ___ im fine with sentences running on when theres some measure of poetry to them but in hemingways case its just brief thoughts tacked together with no punctuation
t  whats it like not having an imagination op
        hes right and you are brainlets  theres an ongoing discussion in academia about throwing this hack off the canon because he writes incredibly badly and after the political references have grown stale there is virtually no value to his novels       look at this fucking piece of prose and tell me if you didnt call anyone who posted it as his own on this board a retard
  steinbeck is exactly the same ops still a retard over the speedreading gripe though
  hemingway was massively influential only overheated brainlets of academia could possibly work up the anger to throw him out of the canon as if to make room for someone else someone more diverse youre too late hemingways mark was made decades ago his influence on the beats and the rest of the wild generations in the second half of the 20th are with us still go be a bugman somewhere else we talk about literature here
  yeah like im gonna trust numale academics who feel threatened by traditionally masculine writing that women often dont understand
    hemingways mark was made decades ago his influence on the beats and the rest of the wild generations in the second half of the 20th are with us still    hemingway is trash and most of the beats are trash as well reread the road theres a reason nobody takes that shit seriously in academia beside selfentitled hipsters who confuse typing with writing people talk about literature here and in fact the names popping up more often are joyce pynchon nabokov and other people who actually can structure novels in an interesting way and can master the english language not the beats the shit you read to pick up girls at your local starbucks not the minimalist carverian shit they tell you to read at your creative writing university insisting on writing short brief sentences because most people are just unable to articulate their thoughts with proper phrases
    yeah nobody thinks about getting melville mccarthy or faulkner out of the canon  despite all of them being pretty racist and sexist and traditionally masculine for our current standards do you ever ask yourself because blood meridian is still in university courses and hemingway is almost nowhere to be seen why moby dick is still studied while people are consistently dropping this hack
      what is parataxis
  nabokov is kind of shit and pynchon writes pomo tomes nobody reads and youve got to be pulling my leg about joyce author of finngeans fucking wake really its gibberish well educated well sown with obscure easter eggs but gibberish    hemingways influence was more than just the beats you fucking dope every author and artist who said fuck it im doing what i want with my writing damn the approval was following hemingways lead those like you who cant do  teach stuff your regrets go read proust and come back to post a safe opinion you got from someone else
  the road was terrible desu
  he meant on the road his criticism is invalid because were talking about hemingway not keruoac
fucking brainlet op christ now im seriously mad fucking opinion makers trying to herd art into what their twisted silly opinion and theories say it should be hang all dilettantes
  all literature is almost by definition divisive counterculture the fuck it im doing what i want sentiment doesnt earn you a place in history    hemingway is populist garbage responsible for three things 1 teaching 10th graders to close read hills like white elephants 2 teaching 12th grade compositon teachers that a 9th grade reading level is ideal 3 teaching edgy college freshmen girls to say omg i love hemingway he was so depressed but so beautiful
  spoken like a twentytwo year old nobody  nobody  cares what students think stop posting and finish your homework
    its the average man modality of writing writing short sentences and paratactic prose in general are accessible to most people which is why they are pushed as aesthetically pleasing and rewarding when you write they are the correspondent of an avenger movie in terms of appealing for the average person it has no other merit than that      nabokov is kind of shit and pynchon writes porno tomes nobody reads  validation from the public is not an indication of quality  validation from peers and experts is and writers except your average 35 year old who has written 1 and half short stories and plans to write a novel since he was 21 because he thought that was a viable way to get laid in college are progressively abandoning hemingway   also when you quote joyce theres ulysses dubliners and portrait to engage with  why do you cherrypick the only unreadable novel he wrote  as for nabokov kind of shit is not an argument  have you read pale fire the gift the true life of sebastian knight those books are genius in terms of style and structure     every author and artist who said fuck it im doing what i want with my writing damn the approval was following hemingways lead  thats the basic of art  doing it like you want you dont need an alcoholic uncle to tell you that you should do what you want thats how you begin to write stories moreover that sounds like the motivational speech a bad writer would give himself and you to tell you to go on despite the fact that they have bad style something to which hemingway agreed both explicitly and implicitly hes a troglodite rediscovering truths about writing which every person with an ounce of talent would discover within the first year of actually working on something the point is you  and the general average coffeemacbook braingriffinstyle writer which you represent  dont      my criticism is valide you undergrad jelly because his argument was that hemingway is good because he influenced people  which first is not an indicator of quality in itself and second is not an indicator of quality if the people you influence are also shit see kerouac
  lit major  well theres your problem right there
  they are the correspondent of an avenger movie in terms of appealing for the average person it has no other merit than that  i dont have to read the rest of your post even if it is addressed to me with this sentiment you have proven yourself a brainless hump who thinks somehow it is better for an author to be obscure and unread than accessible and ubiquitous go moulder on a shelf somewhere then useless    why do you cherrypick the only unreadable novel he wrote  rofl because he proves you are an idiot dont you see that he was making fun of you and your kind
  shits on proust and joyce  puts hemingway on a pedastal  damn i was hoping someone fucking smart would show up to defend hemingway when i saw this thread
  doesnt like hemingway  doesnt like kerouac  doesnt like carver    you know why cause ill fucking tell you you actually need to live a life to truly understand the honesty behind their work youll never get how truly sincere is that kerouac in the first chapter of on the road its so beat up by the journey that he almost goes back unless youve been there
validation from peers and experts is an indication of quality  woof experts in the field of literature only fucking brainless idiots could swallow that one highly educated people who do not create art because they cant telling others what is good art and why grading the minds of writers as if they were one of their fucking class assignments      proust is excellent but the types i abhor flock to him joyce is alright except for his thunderwords brappppp book hemingway ranks among them despite what any of these talentless odious cretins says about the mans prose
  someone who has actually spent some time on earth has joined the thread  hallelujah
  hes not bad but he has only written one great chapter
  op if you dont even understand hemingway then you might legitimately have a doubledigit iq
  i dont mind reading insults as its part of the local culture but if you could put some arguments with those  why would joyce make fun of my kind by writing an unreadable novel when all of his previous ones already fairly challenging bring some support to your thesis if you have one which is not out of wikipedia of some furry tumblr blog      how is sincerity related to quality also does it result necessarily in writing like shit because if you can be sincere and write well then what you say makes no fucking sense
  but if you could put some arguments with those      joyce did it first called it finnegans wake
    woof experts in the field of literature only fucking brainless idiots could swallow that one highly educated people who do not create art because they cant telling others what is good art and why grading the minds of writers as if they were one of their fucking class assignments    what is a valid indication of quality then if you decide by popular vote the hunger games is better than hemingway if you decide by what i called experts joyce is better than hemingway is everything the same to you do you believe that it is possible to judge quality of a novel because as soon as you introduce the notion of quality in something someone will achieve higher levels and someone lower   i have given you a criteria to judge quality peers and experts what is yours
  how is sincerity related to quality  jesus christ just look at the question you are asking    sincerity is the substance of a story i feel bad explaining this to you but humans read to feel to be clay in the authors hand only academic npcs read to feel smart to say to themselves i understood that reference or break down a narrative into components which are to be graded by their frequency visavis similar works
  academic npcs read to feel smart to say to themselves i understood that reference or break down a narrative into components which are to be graded by their frequency visavis similar works  these people exist
  how is sincerity related to quality  seriously no wonder you guys like straight up conmen like peterson so much
  peterson is sincere though
  that post  you deserve every single time i called you a brainlet so far    books of literary merit i would say this means they on some level move the average middlebrow are high art like paintings one either understands a work or they dont there is no wrong and there is no better
  op is one
      being astonished is not an explanation how the fuck did people write the iliad by being sincere were they sitting there fighting with the gods how are historical novels ever written do people travel in time im not one of your mongoloid artsy onenight stands male or female use an argument not rhetoric    also the question stands does writing sincerely implies you write poorly like kerouac are you making an argument to defend bad quality by saying that if you feel life than you cant keep it in the boundaries of your writing because the feeling is so overwhelming that it breaks out from the rules and also that thats the way you make the reader feel am i assuming too much or is this your actual aesthetic theory im open to new opinions enlighten me wise men
    thank you oscar wilde now go back to prison maybe someone will appreciate your witty aphorisms in there let me know if you feel like explaining things or arguing when youve finished eating by that massive bag of dicks you have there
  does writing sincerely implies you write poorly like kerouac are you making an argument to defend bad quality by saying that if you feel life than you cant keep it in the boundaries of your writing because the feeling is so overwhelming that it breaks out from the rules   no dummy im busy petting a cat right now and dont have time to indulge your ignorance but i will do it anyway    writing sincerely means being knowledgeable enough about the human endeavor that what you write is not only emotional powerful but also credible the actual delivery method prose or what have you does not matter as everyone has different tastes you are the only brainlet here who is under the delusion that writers should be graded by experts and peers wise men with degrees  but not creators themselves  who induct or expel artists from the canon
    books of literary merit i would say this means they on some level move the average middlebrow are high art like paintings one either understands a work or they dont there is no wrong and there is no better    are you making an argument to defend bad quality by saying that if you feel life than you cant keep it in the boundaries of your writing because the feeling is so overwhelming that it breaks out from the rules and also that thats the way you make the reader feel
  instead of admitting some art is just not for him he chooses to say it is lacking in quality  pic its you
  being astonished is not an explanation how the fuck did people write the iliad by being sincere were they sitting there fighting with the gods how are historical novels ever written do people travel in time im not one of your mongoloid artsy onenight stands male or female use an argument not rhetoric  holy shit
    i feel like you are still in your teens
  yeah i think i pegged him right 22 years old and dumb as rocks
  no i am a very old fart with a cat
    post pic of the cat
  no you are all furries and perverts on this site
    perverts maybe furries i doubt

  950    watch the whole show and even the series if you want to actually know where your opinions arise from
    being astonished is not an explanation  holy shit
      is it a black cat black cats are the true patrician /lit/izen choice
  lmao incel
  i remember reading his the old man and the sea in high school and didnt enjoy it at all  all the lit teachers went into a lengthy analysis of struggle between man and the nature which i found exaggerated at least i learnt that if you like a story enough you can attribute any fantastical elements to the text and interpret it in pretty much any way
  look seriously its not my fault if a retard thinks that writing with sincerity means that you have to actually experience what youre writing in details like plot wise like history wise  writing with sincerity means that the author feels or has felt the emotional baggage with which he weighs his work you can write a good love story in a period piece cause love is fucking universal and goethe got heartbroken in the xix same way you got heartbroken last tuesday
  good post op is only proving he doesnt understand hemingway the work is not inferior ops ability to access all of its meaning is
  different anon you can make a case that all writing is in some way insincere if you suppose that indirectness is somehow always insincere you can also argue for the insincerity via some psychoanalytic route i suspect    no matter what pitch of frankness directness or authenticity he may strive for the writers mask and the readers are less removable than those of the oral communicator and his hearer for writing is itself an indirection direct com munication by script is impossible this makes writing not less but more interesting although perhaps less noble than speech for man lives largely by indirection and only beneath the in directions that sustain him is his true nature to be found writing alone however will never bring us truly beneath to the actuality  
    then what the fuck did that matter to your discussion are you arguing that hemingway and kerouac wrote with more sincerity than joyce and then criticizing the guy by saying theres no such thing as a scale of quality in judging art you are all over the place feed your cat instead of posting
hemingway is garbage and the only reason /lit/ defends him is because he was obsessed with his masculine selfimage like most of the manlets here
  thats not me im leaving for errands op is a dope art is art and academics are the worst judge of artistic ability stay black /lit/
  but like everything is subjective and i surely must have an opinion if i read books for four years like my own opinion i mean whatever i dont even believe in anything but science even though that means i dont exist as a coherent person and my opinions are constructed too but its all politics and im just a channel anyhow its not like i have to work at developing a taste for something thats what were born with i think taste is subjective which doesnt exist so this opinion doesnt even matter anyhow youre all just being mean and i hope you hemmingway yourselves too
    assuming hemingway or any book written before 20 years ago would exist in bookshops or sell at all if academics didnt keep coming up with reasons why they are worth reading    godspeed anon
   academics are the worst judge of artistic ability  not since production of art started becoming an enormous circlejerk
  the canon isnt a real thing retard
  its impossible to speed read because of this i dont have time to sit and study a fuckin novel like i did when i was a lit major  lmao shut the fuck up fag
i read a paragraph excerpt in a writing craft guide that sampled about 100 prominent authors and it was certainly the worst  screamingly awful dreck american authors are a plague they need to stop existing yesterday      look at that face  what is that  george steiner was born in 1929 in paris to viennese jewish parents   very weak attempt shill
  yeah cause academics have the economic incentive to sell good books by dead authors its the economy stupid academics are only apart of the process to validate the morals in some esoteric textual ceremony the cathedral is important to business but only so because plebs need a moral authority if the church removed that position youd say the same about them sister
    youre an idiot if you think thats true
  what am i reading
op btfoing everybody in this thread lmao
  t op
    ma vattene affanculo nessuno sta negando che cè un valore economico rincoglionito del cazzo  assumere che sia lunico valore è da imbecilli e non risolve la domanda qual è il valore economico di joyce qual è il valore economico di hemingway in base a cosa si decide vedrai che dietro cè il discorso accademico per quanto laccademia possa far cagare a me e a te
  you havent read and like if joyce if you dont like hemingway joyce is hemingway but slightly more descriptive and flowery read some short stories from dubliners if you dont believe me
  well which books are in it who decides them can some writers be removed from it because they triggered people like op
  is this too meta that i cant understand it or too dumb that its on another plane of existence and thus i cant understand it
   the canon is a myth   no it isnt   well what is a canon    no cunt you first what is your understanding of a canon
within a month of their move the nazis occupied paris and of the many jewish children in steiners class at school he was one of only two who survived the war6  dammit hitler you had one job now look what happened    again his fathers insight had saved his family and this made steiner feel like a survivor which profoundly influenced his later writings my whole life has been about death remembering and the holocaust6 steiner became a grateful wanderer saying that trees have roots and i have legs i owe my life to that  der ewiger wandernder jude is very real frens know the signs the life you save could be your own
  he is implying that academics are all controled by corps we all know that only applies to medicine
    how can you honestly think kerouac and hemingway are shit both of them write with fresh perspectives and novel voices why make it more complicated i am a big fan of the writers you seem to prefer but i have to say i really really enjoy kerouacs work    idk if youve read more than on the road but he was writing an old memory from when he was young there there is a reason why kerouac became so disillusioned with a lot of what youre complaining about and his later stories are so deep and reflective of his real growthas pretentious as it is it isnt on the road that makes kerouac so specialhemingway is similar when oh go big picturegreatest writer tier nooonono but better than most yes     theyre definitely not shit though kerouac im most defensive of right now
    finnegans wake is not unreadable    so many narrow minds here
yup hemingway is shit fuck that fish
paintingway was superior
  he didnt ask you what a canon was he asked what was in the canon answer the question and stop deflecting
hemingways short declarative sentences are simple but there is elegance to be found in simplicity    hemingways iceberg theory is pleasant and is like homer where many things are not expressly said but still communicates the highest truths       yeah this can be found in dublinersit makes me think of the last sentence in a painful case he felt that he was alone this one simple sentence says soo much after reading the story
hemingway was good his short stories are good he has a dignity in his world view and his writing that is admirable there is a beauty to the cadence and roving details in his sentences he was highly rated by his contemporaries writers recognize the value in his writing
      wow look at that i answered his question    given that each of his questions are covered within the first twenty minutes of any university canon meth formation course im challenging the conclusion that hes at all familiar with the idea of a literary canon piss off
    i have read everything from joyce and comparing dubliners with hemingway is preposterous and only shows your complete inability of distinguishing different ways of using language
  hmmm nope still not real
people like the idea of hemingway his liquored lifestyle and his pictures like the one you posted people dont actually like hemingway
  well youve pretty much demonstrated your authority on the subject guess ill bow out
  okay mister wikipedia     maybe the real canon was all the friends we made along the way
  do do you think we can save the canon with the power of western friendship
        reflect on this
  by the books of holy scripture are understood those which ought to be the canon that is to say the rules of christian life and because all rules of life which men are in conscience bound to observe are laws the question of the scripture is the question of what is law throughout all christendome both naturall and civill for though it be not determined in scripture what laws every christian king shall constitute in his own dominions yet it is determined what laws he shall not constitute seeing therefore i have already proved that soveraigns in their own dominions are the sole legislators those books only are canonicall that is law in every nation which are established for such by the soveraign authority
  canon1  /ˈkanən/submit  noun  1  a general law rule principle or criterion by which something is judged  the appointment violated the canons of fair play and equal opportunity  synonyms principle rule law tenet precept more  2  a collection or list of sacred books accepted as genuine  the formation of the biblical canon
  a collection or list of sacred books accepted as genuine  accepted by whom my dear property
  by the authority of our academic institutions
    what no academics are not the gatekeepers of what old books get sold you idiots these books are sold to a market not disseminated by academics their selection is inherent to the institution and the only books to disappear are those that lack some quality of possibly being made into moral arguments this says nothing of the appetite of the market sorry for the jargon and slipperiness       back to work or back over the wall
  didnt you read this
  who has dominion over the marketswho controls the publishing houseswho controls the media that influences people to buy this or that
  ii i cant read
  its obvious that jews of seized power in these areas and in academia as well and are undermining the western canon

    is this the /lit/erary flat earther equivalent
  /lit/erary flat earther equivalent  no that would be being monolingual
  no we got the data and you aint gonna see it cause its more fun for both sides this way
  how literature is used by the educational system is indicative of its quality  dude lame
   ignoring this whole discussion on canon
has any of you read for whom the bell tolls  read it and tell me hemingway is not a hack i challenge you
  only parts i skipped were the love shit with him and his stacie wife at the end i rejoiced when his whore wife and son born of sin diedthe banter between the soldiers was kind in the first half
i never like hemingway and i never liked anyone who did either desu
  i read it and it started to dawn on me that robert jordan was a fanatical brainwashed commie willing to do anythinghe was the bad guy

  i wish i could but it doesnt exist anymore as far as we know    maybe itll show up in a bundle of scrolls in a dedicated suicide cave in egypt somewhere
damn its all over for america isnt it
  who is chris hedges
  most likely  eu assuming merkel has a proper successor and not some dumb nationalist and china will swoop in as the big players once again
  sadly no were going to keep stumbling along and getting more pozzed until someone can bring themselves to end the republic i havent read hedges book but im sure its his typical brand of leftwing moralism about the uncouthness of drumpf
  nah there is a rough patch at most
  hedges seems pretty central just weary of big corporations  but is it not a sign of end times that the supposed moral party voted in a serial adulterer conman nonbeliever doubledivorcee etc   playing the victim when people actually try to talk about trump is such a lame move like you know hes a piece of shit and cant properly argue your way out of it so you call his critics obsessed or whatever
  but is it not a sign of end times that the supposed moral party voted in a serial adulterer conman nonbeliever doubledivorcee etc   not all that incomparable with other presidents both parties are moralists we just memoryholed the bit where progressives were the superprotestant party until roughly 68er revolutions when everyone stopped believing in that shit anyway and i guess the irish takeover of the democratic party around that time
  irish and jewish  how could i forget
trump is the end of the world im ready to fucking die     jackson punted baby indians into rivers and adams imprisoned reporters     i suggest getting some cream for those sore red sphincters and maybe buying yourself a gallon of ice cream have a nice cry
  wilson and fdr basically launched us on crusades for literally no reason after running on a platform of not doing that of course the other sides in those wars were big meanies as in not necessarily progressives so a crusade was necessary
  but is it not a sign of end times that the supposed moral party voted in a serial adulterer conman nonbeliever doubledivorcee etc  the problem is that instead of rejecting the candidate and rejecting the party they reject the morality
  the left wing has been radical since the 30s and gained momentum in the 60s     for the first time the right is radicalized and it scared the shit out of normies basically what youre saying is  wwaaahhh christians dont take our shit anymore  after decades of delegitimization of christianity die faggot    t atheist
  they arent really that radical though outside of a corner of the internet the right is mostly 90s democrats nowadays and would actually be considered to be left of bill clinton on a 90s political spectrum on most issues given the pivot of the democrats on trade in reality the left is rapidly accelerating leftward on a chavista trajectory the left always wins so we will doubtless get chavismo here but with the added insanity of american racial politics that werent there so much in say brazil imagine brazil but with a more psychotic leadership that actually wants to punish you instead of just engage in corruption this is the trajectory of the us
  eu assuming merkel has a proper successor and not some dumb nationalist and china will swoop in  eu  lmfao
  pffffhahaha how ignorant of history are you that you can think like this
  yes the left is worsening and like a rabid dog that needs to be put down     but youre underestimating the polarization even 90 year olds are stocking their gun cabinets and ready to put bullets in the heads of people with neon haircuts prepare accordingly
  the radical left the actual radical left not bernie sanders voters is tiny while the radical right makes up a good 20 to 30 percent of the population
  sounds like a cnn viewer lol    i wish that were true
  the radical right makes up a good 20 to 30 percent of the population  can i get a source on this
  radical leftists are just clients of the establishment left college communists start out as professors kids and grow up to be government employees ngo activists radical lawyers journalists professors etc
    would you not class someone whos still on donald trumps side as farright even discounting people who dont follow politics closely he and his platform still have huge support      guess im waiting for my dnc check to take me out of my meme webdev job
  trump  farright
  everybody huuuurrrtssssss  everybodyyyyy crrriiiieesss    summmmmmmtttyyyymmeesss
  donald trump is to the left of bill clinton on a 1990s spectrum except on gun rights pretty much im serious compare his stated positions on things vs clinton 1992
  donald trump is a neocon
  where do you think the far right starts then im not out there calling trump a fascist or anything but id say his aggressive nationalism contempt for the press etc make him pretty right      ill check it out i dont know much about clinton      id agree that his actions which seem to be dictated by the cabinet primarily are but his rhetoric certainly isnt a big point during the campaign was that he seemed less hawkish than clinton
being an extremist /pol/tard i have to admit thats a really great book title fake and gay though
  underage detected    i mean i guess sucking the cocks of corporate media congolomerates has become a left wing thing but only post george w lmao the fact that you belive nationalism is a bad word shows your small knowledge of the world america and europe are ground zero for multiculturalism and are in fact the least nationalistic societies in existence i know you think being a nationalist is some kind of right wing dogwhistle even though every celebrity post 9/11 was bascially rimming the republicans preiraq war and talking about how we all need to root for our team i say this as someone that generally thinks republicans are total fags but somehow theyve become funner to be in a room with than anyone even on the center left
  by design the kikes are done with us china is taking over as the worlds factory
  im 22  the fact that you belive nationalism is a bad word   i said no such thing  america and europe are ground zero for multiculturalism and are in fact the least nationalistic societies in existence  and nationalism is a trait associated with the right donald trump is nationalistic the fact that the united states is multicultural does not negate that  i know you think being a nationalist is some kind of right wing dogwhistle   its generally a rightwing trait yes  even though every celebrity post 9/11 was bascially rimming the republicans preiraq war and talking about how we all need to root for our team  milquetoast liberals going to the right after a disaster isnt surprising
  nationalism was leftwing depending when youre looking at the political spectrum as it was seen as a modernizing force
  your implication is that nationalism is specifically a farright phenomenon and it just isnt i can see that trump has some very aggressive tendencies most other places on earth celebrate being a nationalist the only place its so heavily contested is here because theres no central identity/social fabric with how heterogeneous we are and people conflate it with white identity etc     im not arguing that nationalism is a good thing by any means a lot of people have died in its name and it does indeed spur a lot of ugliness but your analysis of it seems to be fundamentally flawed my friend they always kill the people that tell the truth so become and individualist like me and live your life in quiet desperation as you understand people more the right isnt the enemy anymore than the left authority is the enemy and you can thwart it by being self aware enough to navigate the tribes while building a higher understanding of yourself
why is nationalism even that bad seems like lefties like to conflate it with jingoism
  i dont really understand what youre saying or how its relevant to my original post particularly since im a catholic integralist but ok
  this is just plain wrong trumps whole economic agenda his economic nationalism is a reaction to the disastrous effects of clintons globalist policies  namely nafta
  leftists were a large proportion of the people opposed to free trade agreements and globalization in the 90s dude they were also more antiimmigration remember harry reid arguing for abolishing birthright citizenship we just reached a critical mass of mexicans and liberals of both wings care about nothing but achieving power so they made a strategic pivot in light of new electoral realities
  sweetheart when people talk about trump they dont talk about real politics and especially not policy    its 100 cultural and yes hes way far left compared to clinton in this regard
  i dont deny any of that leftists as opposed to liberals have always been opposed to free trade and globalization clintons no leftist      its 100 cultural  and thats a mistake we should be discussing policy
    its not theres nothing wrong with wanting whats best for your country everyone from every nation should want thatits still so bizarre to me that people see trump as a radical hes such a centrist but when your coming from the perspective of where the left is/ is going someone with moderate views comes off as far right
  leftists as opposed to liberals have always been opposed to free trade and globalization   did you just memoryhole the bit where marx advocated free trade in the name of more rapidly revolutionizing the productive forces of society and hastening the communist revolution    leftists as opposed to liberals  leftism is a wing of liberalism its not a coincidence that young communists grow up to be progressive liberals line up behind liberals electorally and take money from liberal patrons for their activism
i dont know why everyone is claiming that the us is falling apart when france is shooting people like its 2014 ukraine we are doing just fine compared to the government killing its own citizens
  would you not class someone whos still on donald trumps side as farright  why still are you implying hes moved further right over the past two years or something
  like you know hes a piece of shit  obviously most politicians or big business men are people liked him because he spoke his mind and actually took a decent stance on border issues
  if by speaking his mind you mean making shit up that he knows will resonate with angry people then sure you could say that
  more of a usurper
you should really hope it is the fall of the american empire is necessary to save this planet
  implying the world can be saved
  whatever you want to call it people clearly found it more admirable than all the other faggots who just tow the party line and try to be as vanilla as possible in a half hearted attempt to garner more votes
i need to read this thanks for reminding me op
  i couldnt agree more ill be ready to talk policy when you purge the cultural engineers from your ranks as theyre taking up valuable public and intellectual space
  this times one billion trillion please put another tampon in and learn to square this if youre liberal were ready to move on
  needing to read safe whiney bernie tier soft leftism    do you actually think there will be anything you havent already heard a million times in there i cant think of anything more mind numbing
  imagine brazil but with a more psychotic leadership that actually wants to punish you instead of just engage in corruption  verily i couldnt
  i dont think you know what the left is
hedges is another leftist who wraps his hatred of the rich in concern for the poor he was just mad about going to a rich wasp boarding school in connecticut on scholarship but pretends that he gives a shit about workers the dude is just complete generic the nation tier pablum
  they fond it admirable because he told them what they wanted to hear his words have very little do with the truth of things he just plays the crowd like it was a game show     trump has no motivations other than secure trumps power he would through anyone under a bus if he thought he could gain from it thats why hes insulted war veterans and the families of kia soldiers when they disagreed with him despite styling himself as the promilitary candidate
   is tribalism bad
  the left wing has been radical since the 30s and gained momentum in the 60s  uh stop lying asshole your idea of a radical left is someone asking politely for national health and that their vote actually be counted even if they are black     for the first time the right is radicalized and it scared the shit out of normies  wrong again as pic related shows dont you get tired of being always wrong you mutants have always been supremacist turds youre just more open about it now     t atheist  stop lying asshole
  if i wanted to read this kind of clueless brainlet analysis id go to reddit or sign up for a dnc newsletter
  his words have very little do with the truth of things he just plays the crowd like it was a game show  trump has no motivations other than secure trumps power  so just like virtually every politician to ever exist in the history of humanity
  somebody is a grumpy goose
  maybe you should      no every politician is selfinterested to a degree yes but you can tell when one has a set of transcendent values that they live by and when one doesnt take someone like obama he clearly believed in citizens democracy and the need for compromise as he recognised these as integral to running a wellfunctioning state trump on the other hand does not care for either of these and only speaks well of them when its politically inconvenient not to our reality is not beholden to snarky observations there are clear differences in moral character
  and how is trump not running a well functioning state
  you might be surprised to know i actually think socialized medicine is a good idea you retarted faggot all this cultural claiming and fighting has been going on since the 30s and a rudimentary look at communists in hollywood will show you that looo at the golden age of science fiction ushered in by campbell it was a direct response to slow crawling communism in the fantasy/sci fi community all this shit is super old its obvious your conspiratorial thinking is leafing you down a path where people are desperate into tribes im not even right wing you fagoid the new right is pulling from old things but theyve been gifted everything from classical literature to absurdist comedy as the left desperately grabs at cultural hegemony they have the field of subversiveness which is a dangerous thing the left conceded to them as they become less flexible with cultural expression i suspect youre a christcuck
  take someone like obama he clearly believed in citizens democracy and the need for compromise as he recognised these as integral to running a wellfunctioning state  oh you poor selfdeluded fool
  socialized medicine    the left lost this as soon as they let nationalized healthcare be called socialized medicine
  black people hispanics and jews get their own magazines/newspapers why cant white people
  perhaps youve never heard of a little publication called forbes
  fuckin got em
  i kinda want to smooch that fat tummy even though i hate her
  yeah who am i kidding id worship her little pig butthole without reservations    but id also fuck a blow up doll behind the dumpsters at taco casa
  he unironically did i know its popular to suggest that all american politics are just as ruthless and amoral as cheney and nixon and whoever else buts a lie now of course he did underhanded stuff too that comes part and parcel of being us president im sure hes been responsible for many shady things well never hear about but that doesnt discredit his efforts to push for citizen engagement and bipartisanship in the us watch any of his speeches and i mean actually watch them dont just watch a 3 minute sound bite from fox news and youll see this clearly
  when i think of obama i think that its better that he blew the heads off of babies with drones instead of actual american troops raping them to death there might have even been a meat mist where a rainbow shined through    its all the same shit jackass liberalism just has a smiley face on the end of the condom they use to bend you over
  i think many presidents start with the best of intentions then when they take office and are shown all the alien bodies they lose the will to go on with it
where do i start with nietzsche   preferably something short
  genealogy of morality of course
look mom i posted it again  gonna own these cringfags so hard  wow based

  start at the end and never begin
            thank you freinds
  real talk tho begin with beyond good and evil it touches on all the themes he would ever deal with and is stylistically the most engaging of his major works imo even tho this is sometimes to the detriment of a given ideas explication theres so much passion and energy in beyond good and evil
  thanks for the advice mate i think i probably will start with that
  your penis
  op btfo how will he ever recover
    i started off with bgae definitely recommend it to entrants of nietzsche
  on truth and lies in a nonmoral sense
    these dolts are right
  agreed

  seconding this if more /lit/ posters read just this work itd almost be enough to make discussions of n on here decent
schopenhauer as educator from untimely meditations  then the birth of tragedy or human all too human  if you started with the greeks you should be able to understand the birth of tragedy  if not then read or watch aeschylus prometheus bound and euripides medea and bear in mind while reading the birth of tragedy that euripides was part of socrates circle of friends that socrates was said to have introduced ethics into philosophy which had hitherto been mostly about metaphysics and physics and that both socrates and euripides were regarded by the people of athens from their time as intellectually decadent and had a strong formative influence on their respective arts  by the way even though nietzsche was good friends with richard wagner at one point his favorite musicians were chopin liszt gast and rossini hearing these composers pieces performed might give you an idea of what kind of mood he was into and what his works might sound like musically

  i am convinced that students at elite private universities are intellectually inferior to us proles at merely respectable schools    spiritually inferior thats obvious the only people who could survive the modern admissions process are neurotic termites who have been groomed since birth to believe that associating with a selective superbrand university will prove theyre geniuses fundamentally these are eusocial creeps obsessed with status and attention they are not people so much as they are insentient and fleshy nodes of social information look at their faces and you will see theyve got that innsmouth look a sort of hollow and perfectly groomed oversocialized selfsatisfaction characteristic to sociopaths and nancy pelosi sometimes i feel the urge to pop their heads like pimples and see all the likes and good boy pats on the bottom come pouring out like pus    intellectually inferior though but dont the exceptional test scores which their parents bullied them for prove that truly we are among gods    no    for one thing if standardized test scores were an actual measure of intellectual ability and not distantly correlated with it then the only thing that universities with 4 admissions rates should need to look at are the test scores themselves and once upon a time they were harold bloom ezra pound and ts eliotthese were mediocre high school students who were of the correct social class and who performed relatively well on entrance examinations and thus were admitted to the halls of yale upenn and harvard respectively    but in the age of the chinese striver the prep class the teacher recommendation the tiger mom the only thing that matters are leadership skills extracurriculars and personality the test scores are just the credentials which allow you to even be considered because as admissions officers know just about anybody can do well on a test    the whole system is so stupid and outrageous that the only people who are dumb enough to trust it are the students who survive the meatgrinder themselves people want to go to harvard because harvard is selectivenot because harvard is a particularly good school with an interesting history where you would learn important things harvard is not a university harvard is a networking opportunity a livein job fair a real live interactive linkedin page    whats more is that just about everybody has caught on by nowexcept the students at these schools the rubes the morons    one day were going to look back and laugh at how stupid the whole farce the whole performance was

  not that guy but if youd familiarize yourself with higher education youd probably stop ragging on those people as ive stopped doing once you realize how many shitty students also exist at the more prestigious institutions there probably isnt as big of a difference separating students from state schools as elite universities as youd think at either the majority are unremarkableperhaps the families and children of those at elite schools are slightly better at navigating through bureaucracies a higher proportion are probably smarter but how high of a percentage and how much does genius factor into success anyways    if we wanted to right now we could probably compile a fairly comprehensive list of notable authors who never attended college at all

folly given all this
been studying german just started on french mostly using duolingo and memrise with some michel thomas courses from /t/ the goal is to be able to read celine in french and meme philosophy books in german
google translate is the new tower of babel
  es gibt auch andere lesenswerte deutsche bücher als nur die über philosophie
learning more than one language is abomination and not speaking your ethnic tongue is genocidal brainwashing
  americans are orcs though
learning german duolingo and memrise make me feel like a retarded robot like its not the greatest use of time have the german for reading pdf and a schaums grammar book plus been listening to german poetry and watching movies and that sorta thing still i feel like theres something more substantial i could be doing i really wanna chew on the language and learn concretely each day online gamified stuff feels like fluffing around the edges some of its been useful but i feel like it might do more harm than good what should my locus of language learning be whats a solid activity i can orient it around i feel like i have lots of good supplements but no core

ive recently used duolingo and it only feels retarded my native tongue is spanish and ive been learning english since the age of 2 i recently started the english course on duolingo to get a feel for it and my impression was that if i didnt knew english already and i took the english course id learn fucking nothing    what are some nonmeme ways of learning languages
  spanish and french fuck you ill never gibe up
  focus on reading comprehension you dont really need to communicate with germans at all
  esto cuáles son algunas maneras rojopiladas de aprender lenguas
  name a good german prose stylist
  nietzsche kafka mann walser musil the list goes on
  actually talking and using the language youre learning is the stuff youre looking for learn the grammar and some vocabulary then move to the country its language youre learning and interact with the people there its the only significant way the second best is reading as much as you can relying on the dictionary as little as possible
  kneechee that sarasota book is really good
  my advice rush through sandberg up to chapter 1015 to get basics down then just start doing one chapter a day or two days or whatever you prefer while reading real articles/books/etc something at a lowish skill level like journalistic prose and within your interests
  any languages with straightforward/reduced preposition usage and in general is it fair to say a language with a more involved case system will make less use of prepositions
  looking at japanese poetry at the moment  the modern ones are easy enough but the poems from ogura hyakunin isshu are exceedingly difficult even if theyre the poems everyone knows in japan im guessing its the dated language
taking german classes at uni on the side it forces me to study and learn new words regularly which is good because i have a tendency to quit new stuff easily but its also taking a bit of fun out of the experience especially now that im getting semifluent b1 and its more about vocabulary and comprehension than grammar
  you can tell from his classroom german that he doesnt have the faintest fucking clue about german style  its likely that he can barely read it probably took him 5 minutes and the assistance of multiple online resources to type that sentence
i had studied latin for about 2 years then didnt practice for another 3 and forgot most of it somebody just fucking shoot me   so far my lingustic stats are  native russian  english can read/can talk  spanish can read  latin can read simple texts  wish i had the motivation to study an asian language but im not a weeb or koreaboo so its hard to think of an endgoal to such undertaking
  i really wanna chew on the language and learn concretely each day  why are you learning a 2nd language with your english in this sort of state
  i found german a bit easier to learn after i got myself a couple of books i want to read in the language i have some hesse and kafka and they motivate me  other than that i dont really understand people that learn a language just for the fun of it and picking a random internet popular language such as japanese i eventually want to live in a german speaking country but maybe im a pleb gaijin idk
  ich bin deutscher idiot
  this  i just want to read kafka i have zero interest in communicating with retarded germans
  other than that i dont really understand people that learn a language just for the fun of it and picking a random internet popular language such as japanese i eventually want to live in a german speaking country  maybe they want to live in japan and popular internet language like japan every other person on this board is trying to learn german by far the most popular language on here learning a language is a fun and fulfilling endeavor regardless of whatever reason you have for doing it
learning japanese   havent taken jcat nor jlpt but id guess im mid to high n3  as of late it feels like ive arrived at or am getting close to intermediate hell since i find myself looking up like 5 words per sentence sometimes but only 1 grammar point per paragraph or even page   probably wrong in my self assessment though i havent picked up serious literature yet
ive been working on my latin through lingua per se ilustrata familia and im fairly proud of my progress ive barely started but the lessons seem to be sticking in  if possible id like to have some good roman writers recommended for the future aside from the obvious ones such as ovid luciano and virgil id like to know about all the hidden gems
  martial is great if you want some entrytier poetry
  ive been working on a paper about him among many other authors and he seemed interesting enough but im happy to have him recommended thanks
  are you taking a class
im working on english   its the only language i know but im still working at it
  not currently but i did take 101 in uni took a whole semester to get through 3 chapters of the standard textbook that everyone starts with genki i had already started my self study by that point so it was really useless also the one time i actually had a question for the professor she couldnt give me anything concrete guess she never studied her own language formally
  im wanting to start self studying it do you have any resources or tips to recommend
  apuleius is pretty significant as he wrote the only   latin novel to survive in its entirety but thats going to be far down the road
  im sure you can find your way just by using google its what i did theres a thread on  thats dedicated to learning they even wrote their own guide and made a website for it threads currently down but someone will make a new one soon     most of my tips that i didnt see in beginners resources arent in them because theyre sort of meant for people who already have their bearings on how to go about learning its easier to explain them once you know about the common methodologies resources etc if you want i can do a write up for you to save and go back to later but honestly i feel like most of it is something youll find out on your own if you persevere diligently
cool larp thread
about to take n1 bros  didnt study bros  help me bros
  about to graduate and then planning to do a masters in germany next fall     basically going to spend the next 10 months doing intensive german study and hopefully over half of that actually in germany too     my methodology at this point is just reading and memorizing vocabulary going to add in a composition component too as i need to be able to write pretty well in german for my program i grew up speaking german so this will be pretty easy but with no formal education i really need to hammer out my grammar and vocab
have a 4 month break from uni so decided to teach myself italian 1 month in and i feel im doing alright with the genders plurals articles and some verbs down found a grammar pdf of a book online which i just do lessons from since i decided to start with the very foundations of the language rather than the normal way of learning a whole lot of common phrases first  doing 4 papers in chinese starting next year at uni too which will be interesting since i can compare and contrast it to selfteaching a language i was considering doing japanese since it would probably be more fun but itd be best to learn chinese first for business opportunities and teach myself japanese postuni

  hyakunin isshu isnt that bad once you get used to classical japanese i still cant handle a lot of manyoshu era stuff very well though its good to practice reading that stuff though since japanese literature was written pretty consistently with heianera grammar up until to modern age
  courses can certainly be a great help but i dont feel its absolutely necessary with a language like german you just need to get out and use the language as much as possible and if a course is what gets you to do that then thats great
  any tips on how to become more familiar with it any stuff written on this
  i remember feeling the same way when i started learning french my advice would be to jump straight into these language learning apps where you talk to people who are native in the language youre learning   sometimes they are retarded are and make mistakes in their own language but its much more natural nevertheless and you also meet some fun people if youre lucky
  dont feel bad i took french in school for almost 4 years and i dont remember any of it

  started and proceeded with djt guide from  the guide is great even if the threads themselves are shit took a bit more than a year and a half all while i was generally lazy about shit but autistic about writing practice which took a third to half of the total study time so at a more reasonable pace a year is more than enough to get to my current level

how do i into writing  i have a great idea for a novel which will certainly be considered one of the most important books in history but im not a writer
  tell me what it is anon i wont steal it
  a postmodern work on how we build our identity and find purpose in life draws heavily from nietzsche and foucault  it will reconcile post modernism and modernism and also left and right and will usher in a new era of happiness and meaning  also the main character is kind of an outsider
  this is a cool idea i think the sticky has some books on writing that would probably be the best place to start
  thank you
      its getting harder and harder to tell the ironic narcissists from the drooling idiots who genuinely think their poorlywritten halfbaked first novels will be the greatest work of all time if they finish it at all    sage either way

books on hungarian history im interested in this countrys history since i havent heard much about it outside of the ah empire
as for literature with a historical bent i can recommend the transylvania trilogy by miklos banffy though this one dwells in the time of the late monarchy it does an excellent job at capturing the political climate at the time banffys memoir is also worth checking out if you care to get a first hand look at the interwar years marais memoir is also a solid choice regarding the postwar generation    if you are looking for straight medieval history realm of st stephen would be a good start believe it or not george langs cookbook is great source for both hungarys culinary history and food recipes    the links below are worthy online resources

  ive actually heard that the smollett translation is awful   i read the ormsby seemed good
  based
  i dont want a translation    what about the paper quality
  what about the paper quality  well my edition was a bit too white but the texture was pretty good in any way its worth it for its contents
  i have read smollet and grossman i like grossman better
what about the penguin classics translation by rutherford seems pretty good to me
  i like the john ormsby translation it seems pretty close in spirit and mood to the original      agree the grossman version is an absolute travesty    t native spanish speaker
  i can understand spanish perfectly i dont really want a translated version
  just get pic related or the new one with windmills on the cover both are good
  whats wrong with grossman curious
  hes gross man
  um guys
the john rutherford translation is the best one for the humor
  why do they use motteux instead of ormsby or smollett must all be public domain

  youre such a faggot
  you dont need sex to understand love/ intimacy and if you think you do its probably because you have shallow friendships and a weak relationship with your family  its been a couple years since ive had a gf and i thought i was pining for a new one until i started to make more effort to spend time with my friends and open up to them more the feelings mostly went away
  you have risen above the thots and the fuckboys this is like the resurrection

  it does sound good and i actually kind of attempted this at one point but it has that collegiate air that i am so sick of these days
  i hope allah wipes you from this earth tripcunt but i could not agree with you more
i started reading it and its pretty good its funny in that sad/cynical way that normally i can only find on the internet i also like all the references to prescription drugs but maybe thats just me
  but im kinda sceptical of buying it because you know the author is female  why does that matter in the slightest how does the fact she has boobs and a vagina affect you i know misogyny accusations are thrown around a lot these days but basically youre a misogynist
  hes being ironic have you never entered a thread where anyone was trying to discuss an author that happened to be female
  this is the most scathing indictment i can possibly think of
  you should just steal the book anyone stocking a female author deserves to incur the loss go out of business even     shut up you dumb vagina

so im going in is there anything i need to know about this book before starting the recognitions is one of my favorite books by a large margin and im excited to delve into more gaddis    also just general gaddis thread i guess
so what is it that makes the recognitions so difficult i havent read it but it definitely sounds interesting although ive never read any of the famous long/difficult books longest literary book ive read is catch22
there is a scene overview on the william gaddis website thats helpful to consult if you dont know whos talking other than that just jump right in its very funny and has great characters as well as some touching moments
  the recognitions is interesting because for the most part it is actually not that difficult but like 300 pages in could be more i dont really remember it starts to shift a bit and gaddis explores more abstract styles ultimately the book is surprisingly readable and if you ever feel like you may have missed something there are online annotations out there that are quite helpful highly recommend it
  dont go in expecting a sequel to the recognitions     its considered hard because the actual plot of the book is really reliant on a few details that could be mentioned just once or twice the syntax can get really opaque and he connects and references a ton of shit that you will not have ever heard of
the celibate monastic life is the greatest thing one can experience on earth even the most the most irreligious can experience the immense benefits that such a lifestyle provides academic celibacy used to be a thing it is remarkable how much clearer cleaner and creative the mind is if you dont have base distractions dragging you down and the consequences that stem from their indulgence constant and total interest and enjoyment from life when unchaste and focused on trivial hedonistic pleasures everything outside of them is a chore and the whatever pleasure gained from those experiences passes the moment they end and worse if indulged to their utmost extent eventually manifest in habituation and youre on autopilot all the time the more i dive into the study of the brain and cognitive science the more i realize the necessity of such lifestyles for advancing humanity beyond our animalistic confines once you go to the extreme end of materialism as i have the conclusions of instill more fear in the indulgence of fleshly pleasures than the threat of an eternal hell ever could it shows that the mind is not the idealistic singular cohesive entity that is you that you like to think it is the most distinguishing development is our prefrontal region and we throw this advancement in the trash we use it to further the ends of the more primal regions and in doing so reduce this remarkable region to nothing more than the means to attain pleasure the experience of being human is squandered to live like an animal to the subjection of whims beyond his control musonius rufus said in his lectures to relax the mind is to lose it how true that is we relax it and the next thing we know we are nothing more than slaves to habit and all sorts of nonsense thinking becomes a chore the mind itself atrophies zeal for life dies unrealized potential abounds and can be unlocked yet the innate programming seek pleasure is the one roadblock that is in our way the one that will hijack your life and kill it making you a slave the rest of your days to instant gratification
still only sees other humans as fleshly animals and objects of pleasure like masturbation sleeves  physical love is an expression of faith in the natural order you are trying to habituate the material world and the spiritual entities within it to your atrophied connection to either stop fighting for a moment
driven by hunger a fox tried to reach some grapes hanging high on the vine but was unable to although he leaped with all his strength as he went away the fox remarked oh you arent even ripe yet i dont need any sour grapes people who speak disparagingly of things that they cannot attain would do well to apply this story to themselves
  people who speak disparagingly of things that they cannot attain would do well to apply this story to themselves  implying  the most highly sexed individuals often were the ones who found the most vanity and fruitlessness in indulging fueling the whims of this drive the example of pic related myself and countless others can attest to this its people who cant attain it to whom applies this fable celibate as used in the op would exclude masturbation and lusting itself if this was a sex doll thread you may have a point but it isnt and this isnt what it is about you see celibate and have a kneejerk reaction automatically conflating it with incel and their philosophy and lifestyle two entirely different things
  no that is what it is theres a difference between renouncing something that you possess or can obtain and renouncing something that you cannot have maybe your motivations are actually true or maybe youre just looking for a way to justify your own inadequacies youll have to figure that one out for yourself
that natural order is to fuck like mad in your youth have kids become older and less attractive and then to embark on the generally celibate appreciation of life without resentment of the younger people who are still in their rutting years

i live a pretty ascetic life but the only things i cant quit are booze and the internet maybe ill start the new year with an aggressive attack on these vices
  sexual indulgence is a far greater vice than doing soft drugs eating shitty processed food thats literally been designed to be addictive is bad though and should not be dismissed
  i cant get laid   ree fuck women i hate them anyway  nice way of rationalizing being unattractive to the opposite sex
  
  by reducing women to mere objects of sexual satisfaction youve displayed more hatred than any of the chaste anons ever have
  having sex is virtuous  gonna need you to justify that friend
  not putting benis in vagene is equal to not even being alive
  not that anon but sex properly performed within the bonds of marriage with a loving partner and without contraception is absolutely positively 100 virtuous god said be fruitful and multiply    sex outside of marriage surely you must be joking
  what you are doing is likewise just a really convoluted way of seeking pleasure
  that smuggy is postmodern if someone is stating a fact that is the case and you disagree then you arent very well using logic or reason properly
  materialism clearly wasnt a metaphor   it was reductive materialism dissecting the what makes an individual tick which was clearly implied in that sentence and certainly clarified in the one that followed it if you wade into the deep end of neuroanatomy neuroscience and cognitive science youll see how this desire does not even emanate from your advanced faculties but primal ones how the very activation of it arousal impairs working memory and induces hypofrontality youll see how costly it is to indulge in how its subject to habituation and reinforcement you are reinforcing an instinctual urge the most powerful we have given its evolutionary role in perpetuating the species to such an extreme extent that your more advanced brain is discarded as a means of attaining this insatiable urge for pleasure meanwhile it creates nothing nothing is done at the end of the day you have nothing to show for it all that it does is undermine the agency you exert over life making your ambitions hopes dreams nothing more than vicarious outlets for getting off

  precisely why recognizing this is more unsettling than the threat of hellfire   like these frogs were pulled along much the same way we like to pretend its an act of control or i want to do it but if laid bare and examined its neither of these when such passions are provoked and inflamed youre like these frogs or a fish attracted to a lure which is uncomfortable to admit and reconcile unlike the frogs who i assume would eventually learn that this response isnt getting them food we never learn our lesson in fact the response becomes even stronger the more we feed these urges

  satisfy  you missed the entire point  every time you satisfy you reinforce this instinctual drive   the accessibility bombardment and limitless novelty of stimuli whether pixels or partners makes it an allyoucaneat buffet and the high sexual frequency that follows is what is meant by reinforced to such an extreme extent  who in denying these urges completely actively inhibit your advanced faculties and cloud your judgement altogether with background noise the longing beast emits   it isnt a matter of denying them but preventing them sexual abstinence if practiced mentally as well as physically actually decreases baseline horniness and the mind is no longer bogged down by frivolous sexual intrusions we can even see that as the seminal vesicles become more voided and the response to sexual stimuli is not as pronounced as it would be if sexually active   
celibate monastic posters are always boring brainlets    ive lived the ascetic literary life not just sitting at home browing lit showing off about how monk like you are and occasionally reading a book and it gets fucking boring
  reading comprehension 0/10  brain areas involved in motor preparation arousal and visual association areas showed significantly higher activation in response to sexual pictures when presented to young men with distended seminal vesicles day 1 as when presented to young men with voided seminal vesicles day 2
  why work so hard for something that comes so natural for some  the worm should be a worm the lifeless corpse that is a celibate monk should be a monk and those that seek pleasure and thrive on the spice of life should let their thirst for it overtake them and drive them to the peak of humanity
  the brainlet reveals himself  maybe you should read a book so you arent so boring    i also lived that life for a few years no tv no internet just books and silence it was formative
  it was formative    evidently
taken from science discovers the physiological value of continence
most academics masturbate and get laid  some retard from /lit/ eg op wont become smart through nofap
this is from a not so good book appeals to religion and so forth which are met by some with automatic dismissal but some of the observations are on point sexual ills and disease
   areas involved in motor preparation arousal and visual association areas showed significantly higher activation in response to sexual pictures when presented to young men with distended seminal vesicles day 1 as when presented to young men with voided seminal vesicles day 2    implying that supports your argument at all
  most academics are mediocre and boring i never said this would get in your way of becoming an academic it gets in your way of becoming someone with a boundless amount of energy and drive kant led a totally chaste lifestyle and it translated to the production of fantastic and unrivaled work
  im not op but ive had several long relationships and lots of sexual experience and i think what he says makes sense though that i disagree with the word relax
  and racism  but the work he is famous for is nice
  when in disuse less seminal fluid produced within the vesicles the fluid is recycled internally it is not constantly filling as though it were a bladder where it reaches a point they swell and production is increased when sexually active
  kant was a prideful brainlet he refused to accept that mysteries exist despite them his being btfo by them
  kant was a cryptoswedenborgian who only denied the mysteries to maintain his exoteric persona
  kant was a brainlet who couldnt work out if swedenborg was joking or if we should be worried i say this as a kantian though admittedly one who thinks kant without schopenhauers observations is incomplete and erroneous at times
  i admire to sublimate your weaknesses and faults as a person but you realize you could find vitality in any other way of life youre just dumb lmao
    ill admit it  i was wrong here i failed to read what happened after the first visit and had thought the abstinence was retained throughout it made sense to me that the vesicles would decrease production of seminal fluid some period of disuse  my own experience is that whenever i am unchaste masturbation/sex satiates for about a half hour then the general horniness is comes back readily and provoked much more easily upon seeing any stimuli  whereas after achieving a state of sexual continence for even a few days the baseline horniness and sexual urges decrease and after a few weeks go away almost completely satisfying these urges only was ever a temporary solution for me one that left me drained tired and a shell of my potential self abstinence is the sole solution that freed me from their constant distraction and detriment
ever heard of paragraphs you illiterate piece of shit

  a pythagoras quote  what a fucking pseud you are

i know they overlap for the most part but i hate celibatefags as much as i hate christfags
  porn is bad for you and depending on the circumstances of production some may be called evil masturbation is attending to biological needs nothing more sex is good under proper wholesome conditions
  i originally had the op as a reply in a thread that was removed and it had good feedback so i decided to post it as its own stand alone thread   i have the flu and dont feel like doing much else im not wasting time and i wont be back here for a while once i recover semen retention was a lifechanger for me and i was among the most ardent opponents of it at one time nobody discusses or wants to discuss this topic if a few people benefit then it wasnt a waste of time at all
  porn is a tool of the bourgeoisie change my mind
    good post
the wolf so majestic an iconic symbol of power   these great beasts seem invincible and yet they have a great weakness    the eskimos have always greatly prized the wolf its fur and meat are of great quality and the beast itself is both majestic and powerful killing a wolf was a nearly impossible endeavor without strong weapons and yet the eskimos found a way to do it   they did it not by force in fact they never even touched the wolves the wolves simply killed themselves    an eskimo would first sharpen a knife they would then proceed to soak the knife in seal blood and then freeze it then they would dip it in again and freeze it once more this covered the knife in layer upon layer of frozen blood the knife soon resembled a popsicle    they would jam the knifes hilt into the snow where they thought wolves would be and left    a hungry wolf takes a deep breath of the freezing alaskan air it smells something delicious its mouth starts watering as it tracks the scent fresh blood the wolf eventually tracks the scent to the blood popsicle it begins to slowly lick it it licks away layer after layer of blood until soon they reach down to just the knife they cut their tongue but they hardly notice the freezing blood easily numbs the wolfs tongue the wolf continues to lick at the knife cutting itself more and more pretty soon the wolf begins to feel weak from loss of blood    despite the obvious signs that the knife is harming it the wolf continues to lick the knife it ignores all of the negative signs it feels that getting more blood from the knife would be the answer soon the wolfs mouth is so badly cut that blood starts pouring from its wounds the wolfs tongue starts to thaw as warm blood flows over it the wolf is nothing short of ecstatic that they can taste more blood it attacks the knife more vigorously and aggressively it knows nothing but the taste of blood the wolf will desperately continue to lick the knife until it collapses from blood loss and dies    is there a bloody knife in your life stop licking it who is worse the ignorant wolf who licks the knife out of instinct and desperation or the person that licks the knife knowing full well that they are their own judge jury and executioner
i am literally like that guy from that fap is bad comic hair falling out bed ridden complete mendal retardation currently unemployed and struggle to keep a job struggle to do anything if im not at least 30days into nofap
  the optimum is in never in extremes  do you structure you life on nothing other than empty platitudes parroted by normies

i want to have a wife but retain the benefits of chastity what to do    is there some sort of holy sexuality that wont fuck me up
  snuggle
  tolstoy believed it was immoral and unhealthy to the child to have sex during pregnancy and even while the wife is nursing nursing youd copulate every 20 months for a few weeks seems manageable
  no i dont want any kids and want to have sex often maybe every day but have the benefits of chastity
  alas you cant have your cake and eat it too there is a toll to be paid and you need to ask yourself when its worth it
  i want to abuse the procreative faculty for my own quotidian satisfaction but dont want to deal with the consequences of procreation  most contemptible and dangerous anon you will be ripped apart spiritually
  filename    smart boy who browses tumblr for fillies to fuck do you sincerely hold that chatising the lonely and blameless here will confer anything upon you other than a slight sense of superior selfworth something useful to you only inasmuch as it assists you in your goal to penetrate conceited blogosphere semen demons     then again i laud you  for being a true american
  best way to attenuate the adverse effects is selegiline around 5mg but the adverse effects from sexual activity are still there abstience is still unmatched in terms of benefits gained better than any drug
  empty buzzwords  those are mighty big words coming from a dumb frogposter who unironically uses words like larpcel

  what are you some kind of faggot
  nothing quite like sous viding brains pork brains calf brains cheap too tasty mind boosting  the beginning was the end was right
  is occasional masturbation like a nice middle ground
  its difficult to moderate occasionally due to hormonal rebound once sexual activity resumes best is to avoid stimuli and thoughts and try to reduce frequency as best as you can once you achieve a serious stretch of abstinence youll find it much easier than you had initially thought
  maybe it self regulates because of other things on your schedule   also what is an alternative way to blow steam from stressful work/schedule if not for masturbation
  that is not healthy because youre associating it as a solution for frustration which makes you distracted from the real matter it really doesnt blow off steam either cortisol levels increase it might decrease mental activity slightly but that is like advocating for a therapeutic lobotomy
  you know the real reason people indulge in ascetic lifestyles and yoga  pleasure   once you experience spiritual bliss you cant go back  dont believe me  read about the experience of mystics throughout the ages their ecstatic poetry which often doesnt try to mask the obvious eroticism of the union with the divine read about kundalini experiences about eckhart tolle and gopi krishna take a peek at prometheus risng and the chapter on the neurosomatic circuit where raw unambiguosly states that the reason people get hooked to gurus is because gurus know how to produce neurosomatic spiritual bliss in them do a simple witnessing meditations for a few month one hour a day  the denial of flesh is built upon the expectation of a higher and more lasting bliss that is pleasure  all human behaviour is pleasure oriented whether material or spiritual
hell ya just busted a fat nut fuck u nofap fags now that i got that postnut clarity i can see this site is shit and nofap is a scam to keep your brain foggy and shitposting
                  why not absorb other mens semen as well more semen  more meme power
    and the whole igloo clapped
  its a useless inert mass once it leaves the body the neurochemical and hormonal consequences within the body are what makes it sexual activity so debilitating
  imagine being such an addict that your only moment of clarity is shortly after orgasm only to go away some moments later replaced by lethargy and rebound horniness i want 24/7 clarity not 5 pathetic minutes of it
    i mean why dont you abstain and absorb other mens semen it would easily enter your blood stream through your colon without spending any time outside of the pitchers body provided a little patience
i want to be better and i this makes thing about not having sex and the idea of not having sex give me a lot of anxiety why the fuck i read this thread what the fuck do i do

  do you pathetic faggots really believe this shit you realize that sex is one of the healthiest activities possible both physically and mentally its scientifically proven youre just coping like losers because you cant get laid
    still waiting for spermoids to responds to this    
  appeal to science   please go to sci if you cant comprehend such a simple concept the majority of the canon touches on atonement and spiritual purification through asceticism stop being triggered and putting others down because youre too weak to forsake pleasure
  anal sex is bad for your health
  its scientifically proven  science isnt free from ideology especially when it sees opportunity to promote a progressive agenda
  what about lifting weights walking and studying logic do i have to have sex if i already do all these people that have a lot of sex arent necessarily healthy and often have poor impulse control there are lots of activities comparable but without the risks involved in sex viz having a child having to be around women diseases from fluid exchange etc
  how should that kind of people live then live in constant frustration
  value personal growth more than sex
how do i stop myself from fapping the urge is too great i cant resist it and i waste hours on masturbation how the fuck do i escape from this hell
  do you pathetic faggots really believe this shit  youre seething because this hypothesis is totally incompatible with your hedonsitic indulgence your entire post amounts to a rationlization of his behavior a willful ignorance something akin to a heroin junkie pretending how his drug use isnt affecting his life  you realize that sex is one of the healthiest activities possible both physically and mentally   this claim is baseless and not rooted in medicine this comes from sexology experts such as dr ruth there is no physiological mechanism for why it would be healthy in fact those advocating this often have a gross misunderstanding of the sexual apparatus and have no idea how it functions i have seen sexologists note that semen is stored in the scrotum and needs to be evacuated like a bladder which is totally laughable to even people with a rudimentary understanding of anatomy in fact they represent a giant misstep in the scientific dissection and unraveling of sex   its scientifically proven youre just coping like losers because you cant get laid  it isnt and total sidestepping with a straw man studies that prove this are lifestyle surveys asking individuals how they feel and given that nearly everyone wants sex of course the absence of it represents is going to be associated with some health issue or work intrusion of free time loneliness or some other psychosocial factor  if you want real scientific evidence ie hard experimental or mechanistic studies showing the detriments of indulging in energy and time consuming act im happy to provide them      sexual arousal induces hypofrontality impairing working memory and executive performance  pornographic picture processing interferes with working memory performance      sexual arousal decreases the functional synchronization between cortical areas in young men      the impact of sexual arousal on sexual risktaking and decisionmaking in men and women      adverse effects of sexual excess on the brain    brain structure and functional connectivity associated with pornography consumption the brain on porn    shows a loss of gray matter in the right caudate of the striatum from pornography indulgence      literally stronger than drug urges  craving responses to methamphetamine and sexual visual cues in individuals with methamphetamine use disorder after longterm drug rehabilitation    that sexual demand might be more robust than drug demand
  that implies a celibate life
perhaps each mans conception is his original sin
  i have seen sexologists note that semen is stored in the scrotum and needs to be evacuated like a bladder  and ive seen people make shit up on the internet just to prove their point

  it is a twoway street the mother must be educated that sex and even masturbating during pregnancy may deleteriously affect fetal and neonatal development protip if you need to satiate your wife lest she cheats on you she is going to cheat on you anyways as this is purely the mentality of a sensualist   tolstoy was correct as we see that sexual activity alters womb hormones which can affect development and the impact of the activity itself can contuse the fetus resulting in miscarriage indeed the people and researchers even who say sex while pregnant is harmless are the ones who sound religions their arguments are designed this way or the body wouldnt let this happen if it were so most research saying coitus stating pregnancy is harmless amount to just thinlyveiled appeal to ignorance  indeed nature does not want this to happen which is why morning sickness sensitivities to smell and increased hunger are all universal consequences to pregnancy if you have ever observed or studied wildlife the females of most species violently refused to be mounted while pregnant the modern human woman ignores these builtin safeguards and indulges in sex usually out of her own continued habit or coercion by the husband to carry on with his habit or artificial stimulation due to the overabundance of sexually provocative stimuli to be found in all realms of human life from literature to television to most recently everyday conversationsadly this is reinforced by incorrect information which is found by women who initially set out with good intentions having concerns or fears for engaging in coitus while pregnant this subject is a taboo in medicine admitted by many older obgyns yet is withheld from publishing for fear of being called a prude advocating beliefs from the dark ages or fear of being called an opponent to bodily autonomy her body her choice
of all members of the mammalian family civilized man alone is a victim of an exaggerated and morbid sexual urge a condition which he has inflicted to a certain extent on the animals which he has domesticated and which have adopted his diet especially the dog wild animals in a state of nature practice copulation only at certain mating seasons for the purpose of reproduction civilized man practices this act at all times and in most cases without intention to conceive on the other hand socalled savages and primitive races leading more natural lives and who follow their natural instincts to a greater extent are far chaste in their sexual behavior as noted by havelock ellis such considerations must lead one to the conclusion that the sex life of civilized men is unnatural and that the excessive manifestation of the sex urge among them is due to certain aphrodisiacal stimuli rather than to natural instinct among such stimuli are a highprotein meat diet accompanied by physical inactivity the use of tobacco alcohol and coffee sexually stimulating literature dramas motion pictures conversation etc for these reasons civilized man has departed from the natural law obeyed by animal and primitive races which requires the separation of the sexes during pregnancy and lactation for the benefit of both mother and child violation of this law may account for the large number of physically and mentally defective offspring produced by civilized races as compared with animals and primitive peoples     spencer who studied california indians remarks that after the appearance of menstruation a girl is never allowed in the company of the opposite sex until her marriage and that during pregnancy and lactation there is strict chastity
  there is no time in life when the endocrine glands of the individual may be more powerfully affected by a deficiency of phosphatides than during the months of embryonic development when these glands are most sensitive to their chemical environment the maternal bloodstream deficiency of phosphatides in the mothers blood at this time due to ovarian overactivity as the result of sexual intercourse may affect the development of the thyroid and other endocrine glands of the embryo as well as of its central nervous system this explains the origin of cretins and mongolian idiots when born of parents with normal heredity prof m schlapp neuropsychiatrist of the new york postgraduate hospital has made a special study of this problem studying hundreds of cases of cretins born of normal parents and his conclusion is that a prenatal injury to the thyroid and other glands of the embryo by an endocrine disturbance in the mother was the basic cause of such conditions he noted a preponderance of such children born from adolescent mothers or those approaching the climateric when the ovaries tend to be most active dr schlapp believes that glandular depletion of the mother during gestation is the basic cause of the production of cretins and idiots when there is no direct hereditary causation it is clear that such glandular depletion can result from the excessive withdrawal of phosphatides from the mothers blood as the result of sexual intercourse during pregnancy which also tends to produce endocrine dysfunction in the form of glandular hyperandhypoactivities  older but you can see that physicians used to warn against excessive sex indulgence during pregnancy

  sexual arousal induces hypofrontality impairing working memory and executive performance   picture processing interferes with working memory performance     arousal decreases the functional synchronization between cortical areas in young men     impact of sexual arousal on sexual risktaking and decisionmaking in men and women        and exactly what are you trying to show here half the point of masturbation for me is that it relaxes my mind and allows me to continue working without temptation afterwards hence i agree with all these studies and consider this a reason to masturbate if i feel horny

  thats pretty witty though      there was a story on /d/ about a guy who gave himself protein poisioning or something like that by putting and holding large quantities of his own semen up his ass also what youre saying is a bit like if having blood in your body is so good why not drink other peoples blood or give yourself a blood enema    tbqh it is a fetish of mine to interact with others cum while being forced into chastity myself but id never advocate it as a health practice nor a sex practice since fantasies only produce more fantasies they arent satisfied in any meaningful way
  humans were made for companionship and you will always crave it not matter how you attempt to justify solitude and celibacy to yourself allah sent his prophets to teach us how to live and every one of them who had the chance to get married did so

  companionship doesnt require sex
  tbqh it is a fetish of mine    for fucks sake
  if its any consolation i dont act on my fetishes i did imply that in that post
  you should though that sounds hot as fuck
  now for the benefits  sexuality leads to boosts in mood and meaning in life  timelagged analyses demonstrated that sexual activity on 1 day was related to greater wellbeing the next as for the quality of episodes higher reported sexual pleasure and intimacy predicted greater positive affect and lower negative affect the following day   these data provide evidence to support the continual consideration of sex in empirical work and theoretical models of elements that comprise healthy relationships and a good life     im sure its just jewish propaganda though

with a foreword by jordan b peterson
hope this helps you op
  dang vintage i thought you were above this
  how about instead of jordan b peterson its foreskin b eaterson and hes on a diet where he only eats foreskins
  in the last 8 months alone peterson has made more money than any of you will ever see in your lives gotten more prime pussy than any of you will ever get in your entire lives created more of an impact on society and the world of literature than any of you ever will in your entire lives achieved a higher level of personal discipline and knowledge than any of you ever will in your you guessed it entire lives  ah now all the hate for him makes sense
  hes a shill a fraud
  not him but i fail to see how him being a fraud takes anything away from this posters point
  gotten more prime pussy than any of you will ever get in your entire lives
  gotten more prime pussy than any of you will ever get in your entire lives    now this is interesting has jordan been using his status to gain access to prime boipussi
  how in the hell did they end up going with that cover
  i love these kind of arguments it really shows that the anon posting it really doesnt think any deeper than the superficial they cant comprehend disliking someone for any other reason than them being more successful
  he has his pick of the highest quality incels
  there is no argument only a statement of facts    peterson has us beat on all every the entire spectrum of levels and metrics by which one can measure life
  i would be able to take you more seriously if anyone on this board who ever criticized him gave any reason at all for doing so
  not infrared
  1 he has no idea what postmodernism is  2 he has no idea what marxism is  3 he bases most of his work on jung who is a psuedoscientist  4 he misenterprets nietzsche often  5 his prose is bad
  hawt
  yet another reason to get the superior harper version
  he still cant wrap his brain around the concept that postmodern marxists are a thing distinct from marxism and general postmodernism     wew lad
  what is this posters point that hes successful and therefor we should disregard the fact that all hes shilling is toni robbins for neck beards
  even worse he thinks him being successful makes him right
  its obvious hes just trying to trigger you while youre busy waiting for your sideshabe girlfriend to falsely accuse you     and its working
  why do i come to this shithole again
  because youre fuckin gay
  hmmmm
  he bases most of his work on jung who is a psuedoscientist  jung never claimed to be a scientist nor did he claim his work to be scientific  jung expanded upon the idea of the unconscious the ideas are inherently difficult to scientifically validate
  you just know
  all this post demonstrates is that you have a poor value system note that the first thing you mention is the money mr i will not call him dr peterson has made let me guess trump supporter

angst and opium    how dare you disrespect nietzsche
  respect is a spook
  he probably couldnt cope with the fact he was gay who can blame him though

why does god seem to hate homosexuals he created them after all
  he doesnt
  everyone has that one friend they only keep around because its fun to hate them and bully them passive aggressively
homosexuality is a bad habit horrible fetish like furries and a nesting ground for diseases abuse and all manner of vices     if and only if homosexuality was clinical only separated from heterosexuality by target it would only be a minor perversion however as can be seen from pride parades and whatnot its actually quite obnoxious faggotry and unhealthy to even look at

there was an old book about japanese pows in which a man bartered and sold out his fellow captives for a better lifestyle it was a rather good book but i think nowadays the man might use his training to turn them into a small army and conquer the little town just saying he left that book with little to no respect and i dont blame the author for that 1 bit the dude was just waiting around for the war to end and feeding people rat meat he bred would be nice if theyd like found him and the pows all fed and waiting to enter the war again with new spies/weapons

how many words does a novel need to be to get published i read 80k words does that sound right
not really ive seen short stories getting published as little standalone books the novel isnt defined by the number of words
  typically a short story needs to become famous before it gets into a standalone book usually they are published in compilations i dont think publishers are kind to works that are too short/long
  around 6080k give or take if you want to hit the sweet spot there are some obvious exceptions but if you want to give yourself the best chance that 6080k is a good goal

i know what youre feeling in fact we are all genetically similar organisms and millions of people know what youre feeling except most of them delude themselves into thinking its not true the dissonance leads them to false conclusions    i dont have an answer for you op but honestly keeping busy helps biologically and psychologically  exercise work socialising family friends etc  that stuff helps    or you could commit suicide or use writing as an outlet for all of it
search for a higher meaning in life learn to believe in a god whether its a prestablished one or one you come up with all in your own i think living for a gf was the right idea but not completely correct learn to live for something superior to you not equal or lesser to you
  do shrooms like a lot of shrooms
  in all likelihood this guys girlfriend is better than him
  my cat doesnt always sleeps with me but when he does its one of my few joys theres nothing like falling asleep as he curls up to a ball on my side feeling his soft hairs and breathing next to me and waking up on the morning to his nuzzles and little meows
god i fucking hate cat people your pets suck
  facing suicide is what enabled me to finally get my affairs in order  facing suicide like hamlet
  how would this help    thanks anon      post your cat anons
  the morning because thats when im most likely to get shit done the later in the day it becomes the more likely i am to put study off until the next day

  how would this help  scrambles your brain so you can change how you think do some reading on the therapeutic uses of psychedelics if you feel like nothing matters and everything is a chore they might be able to help you
  is that some gay aussie slang for something
  
the dialectic of enlightenment is overcome in carnaps ideal of explication precisely through the clear separation of the basic theoretical structure of science from its use in society and even by scientists the distinction between its semantics and its pragmatics as the late carnap would have said this liberates scientific knowledge from any particular historical form or social use what knowledge is in the ideal of explication is not the significance it is given by any particular social configuration an establishment or a state scientific knowledge is a group of theoretical claims confirmed or tested to some degree by the procedures agreed by the present practitioners of a particular branch of knowledge the implications drawn from these theories for social political ethical aesthetic or other purposes  even by the present practitioners of that branch of knowledge  are as contestable as any other social or political issue such implications may or may not result from the choice of the larger language of practice in which they are drawn they may result from the choice of language in which the scientific theories themselves are framed but as we have seen even that is contestable  conventional that is  in the sense that those participating in a discussion must at least provisionally agree on that choice in an idealised model of such an agreement process one might imagine a literal convention in which all concerned in the issue came together to agree uncoerced on constitutive language rules    why arent a carnapian yet /lit/
the explicative interaction between evolved and constructed systems  takes the form not of wholesale replacement or superimposition for carnap but of piecemeal exchange within the context of a dynamic mutual feedback relation from the engineering point of view this of course raises problems of its own one of which is the clear identification within the language subject to explication of the pieces to be thus replaced piecemeal by explications framed in the terms of constructed languages in the absence of sharp individuation of concepts how can we clearly identify an explicandum for carnap explication must be preceded by what he calls clarification the largely informal task of establishing a mutual understanding about the identity of the explicandum before proceeding with its replacement and though he did not underestimate this challenge he thought it could be overcome at a practical level    there is a temptation to think that since the explicandum cannot be given in exact terms anyway it does not matter much how we formulate the problem but this would be quite wrong on the contrary since even in the best case we cannot reach full exactness we must in order to prevent the discussion of the problem from becoming entirely futile do all we can to make at least practically clear what is meant as the explicandum what x means by a certain term in contexts of a certain kind is at least practically clear to y if y is able to predict correctly xs interpretation from most of the simple ordinary cases of the use of the term in those contexts it seems to me that in raising problems of analysis or explication philosophers very frequently violate this requirement they ask questions like what is causality what is life what is mind what is justice etc then they often immediately start to look for an answer without first examining the tacit assumption that the terms of the question are at least practically clear enough to serve as a basis for an investigation for an analysis or explication even though the terms in question are unsystematic inexact terms there are means for reaching a relatively good mutual understanding as to their intended meaning
im still stuck on the gateway drug analytics like austin
what happened to vienna  it seems like most of the great continental men who defined the 20th century all came from the era of pre ww1 kings and emperors and so most came through vienna  now it is a useless capitol in an even more useless country should have been added to germany if the anglos werent so fearful  vienna should have become the center of europe not the puppet nation belgium so close to england and so far from centraleastern europe
  semantics  pragmatics  poeisis
  what happened to vienna  the anschluss and wwii happened plus most intellectuals from vienna were kikes freud hans sachs alfred adler wittgenstein karl popper waissman philip frank stefan zweig etc so they all either fucking immigrated or died
  hitler chased all of the worthwhile figures to the anglo world where we welcomed them with open arms
  what happened to vienna  vittorio veneto
  id argue they chased themselves or rather the bourgeois elite of their community did
  and then what  what great schools of thought have they created in anglolands   nothing came from them that they hadnt already inhereted from austria  and that is not the point these men were able to be produced in an enviroment that ceased to exist and with it these men stopped appearing
  carnap is based but his social philosophy/politics are bit too optimistic as is seen in these passages his deep faith in the project of esperanto is another good example of this        this probably the most important part of that story      are you implying that they didnt have to flee for nazi violence because the threat was very much real   their social democrat globalist/cosmopolitan and antimetaphysical views were becoming dangerous ideas to have in vienna       the austrian positivist moving to the usa had a significant impact on the future of american philosophy not only by directly influencing the new major figures in america quine and putnam for example but also by now needing to publish their new and older work english    these men were able to be produced in an enviroment that ceased to exist and with it these men stopped appearing  yes but precisly because these men and everything they represented was wiped out they were the embodiment of a part of that enviroment so when they were gone the enviroment that could produce men like them had also vanished

books  lol i dont waste my time with dead mediums im currently 300k in debt making my vidya magnum opus in order to keep my creation from being corrupted by board member fags marketers and retarded consumers consider yourselves fortunate ive sacrificed my future to bring this gold to life
  i have about 1200 pages of handwritten text  with about 250 more of notes which probably translates into another 1200 to 1500 more it is creative nonfiction i like what i have done with each story but the sum of it starts to resemble hemingways worst selfflagellation i am unironically considering converting the whole thing into a graphic series please help me
74 pages and about 60k words so far ive gotten to a point where im wondering if my characters are cliche and if i should change them but everytime i share them with friends they seem to give me the same response everytime theyre good i like them thats pretty cool and never any elaborate criticism it gets kind of redundant after a while and ive just stuck with my gut to continue writing and finish the story i can always go back and fix shit antways
  just keep writing until its finished anon godspeed
  how the fuck have you contained 60k in 70 pages you write for ants
i havent read a book in like 5 years  can i read this without feeling retarded
  sure accelerationism is for brainlets anyway
why the fuck is everybody nowadays spamming this hack of a philosopher nobody takes seriously
  its like asking why /g/ spams terry davis
no absolutely not why are there so many people on this board who simply do not read it wasnt always like this
you have to read delueze and kant first
probably not
  exactly this youd have to be a brainlet to not understand that
  holy fuck
  the fuck am i reading
  dg quote surrounded by technobabble
  as  said you should probably understand a decent amount of kants epistemology you should at least know what dialectical materialism is from marx and you should have some familiarity with delueze and guattari    also you must have read neuromancer prior to starting also watching the matrix at least once is probably required
  philosopher  nobody except philosophers take each other seriously
  learn to a c c e l e r a t e

not sure if it counts but there is a novel by robert a heinlein i am currently reading called i will fear no evil about a wealthy old man johann sebastian smith who arranges to have his brain transplanted into a young donor body and since he didnt specify the biological sex of the donor said body ends up being female johann now joan pronounced joann decides to become actively female and progressively becomes more feminine as time goes on after the operation    the last place i was on joan was casually conversing with johanns old friend a judge who had just presided over a court case concerning whether or not joan was actually johann and not some impostor in order to determine if joan was entitled to johanns fortune she was pretty much showing off the new body to him in what passes for proper clothing for women in the distant future year of 2015 the book was published in 1970 which is pretty much seethrough clothes and body paint

  daily reminder
i find books written before 2000s are a bit more interesting and less about justifying themselves    tiny pieces of skull roz kaveney    fiction about a trans woman during the 70s written in 80s but noone would publish it in london/chicago drugs bar life love and shit     stone butch blues my leslie feinberg    think everyone knows this one but just incase semiautobiographical butch experience during the 60s/70s spends most passing as a man distressing at times but very worthwhile

reminder that bret easton ellis wrote his first best seller at 19    howre your novels coming along /lit/
well im 24 and i wrote a pretty terrible short story about a guy getting hanged so take that bee
  bret is a rich yuppie with the right connections self conscious about his situation that took adventage of it to publish masturbatory satirical novels he represent the angry bitter old man who is to cool and hip to write anything that can be perceived as sincere there is nothing to envy that
  this  i hate when people with rich parents act like they were selfmade fuck them and damn them to hell
that image gave me the urge to listen to fatboy slim please defenestrate yourself
daily reminder that brianna goux published her first novel at 19
  moving on from the valid criticisms of his work as masturbatory self satire when was the last time he put out a significant text
  he did a sequel to less than zero a couple of years ago that my pseud friend really loved it started with the main character calling the movie a piece of shit
can we discuss american psycho in this thread without it derailing into a dubs thread
  did you read it its terrible its also near ten years old now
  she could make me goux you know what im saying
  im not kidding guys a short story came to me in a dream last night im going to pump this shit out asap before i die becoming famous posthumously
  2010  where is my life going holy shit no i havent i just know my friend never shutting up about how cool it was that the narrator said the person who wrote the book was a different person and the movie happened in the universe of the book havent read anything by him since glamorama
  write novel about partying and drugs and sex  have rich parents to get it published    woah    many people myself included finish a novel from 1520 years of age less than zero is an archtypical utterly meaningless first novel his only achievement is getting it published which his parents ensured for him
  haha im 31 and i have no ideas for a novel but i have two typewriters
how many of you majored in english what percentage of your upperlevel courses would you say focused on classical western lit
  i did and zero
i had a course on western rhetoric and one in classical english lit then i had a class on plays and a class on short stories     these were all easily the best courses the rest were mostly  filled with post structuralist and feminist garbage i still think so fondly of those four classes they were so comfy
  i forgot to add my own experience     i would say about 45 of my upperlevel courses
  literally zero can you explain
  im starting to feel pretty lucky i had at least five courses that were classically based ie milton spenser etc     more and more people that i ask about this report that they have less and less classical exposure in undergrad humanities
  well not zero there was a single one it was a shakespeare class but i dont really count it because the focus of it was about how shakespeare was racist and sexist the goal of the class seemed to be to turn us into directors of all black female versions of his plays
wish i majored in english i majored in accounting because of job security and ended up in a field that has nothing to do with accounting    not dissatisfied with my career field just wish id have been a little more ballsy in college because i never really cared for accounting particularly    on that note zero upperlevel courses focused on classical western lit
  the classics belong to the altright now like all the other interesting cultural developments     we focused on the diary of equiano and a few other stories where the professor was shedding light on sexism in ancient texts i wouldnt have a problem with this but she told us she took out a whole  section on milton for this purpose    im just happy she was so knowledgeable about chaucer and showed us sir gawain
  i dont know how a professor can shed light on sexism in ancient texts is that a blatant anachronism
  yeah even though i majored in english i ended up in a digital marketing agency im glad i just majored in what i wanted to study because it honestly doesnt matter once you go looking for a job unless its a specific science field or something
  nah man we had an entire unit over it mostly dealing with the knights tale and a few other canterbury tales the teacher that taught this course was actually a really nice woman and not even close to being the biggest femme/retard professor i had
  the irony is my favorite professor who taught milton and spenser was also the head of the gender studies program she did a really masterful job of never using a post modern lens when she was teaching classical work i enjoyed her classes a lot but couldnt make it through her feminist theory
  i went to the top uni in my country and majored in english    in our first year we studied twilight  it was possible to graduate without touching any of the ancients because they were put into classics courses there was a lot of victorian literature some poetry     it just seemed like a really fluffy and infantilising experience i guess because it is a low entry degree and it seems to be intended to pander to women because most students are female lots of insane critical theory derived politics only a nominal interest in literature
is this the kind of book i could listen to on audio or does it have weird formatting and footnotes like ij that makes it more fitting for reading than listening    inb4 audiobooks are gay i know i just have a free credit on audible and im interested in this book
  has anyone read it here
you need to relisten over and over or have both  its a very dense novel and things repeat a lot so you gotta filter out a lot of information which is easier with text that said its also really boring at times so the audio can make it seem more bearable
  has footnotes formatting normal enough definitely better for reading than listening    im like 2/3 of the way through it right now fuck the phrase type of thing
for those of you who are wellread when you encounter someone irl who brings up literature do you opt to hide your power level or go good will hunting on their ass
well read to normies means youve read the hunger games harry potter and maybe something by malcolm gladwell showing your true power level would intimidate them
nobody irl likes literature
  i argued only once with a person that insisted on her new age idea of buddhism and i explained her the truth about it since i studied it in university it was pointless she insisted i was wrong so i said whatever and dropped it
    t19 year olds
i test the waters some
  i pretend i dont read  in fact i pretend im retarded which is easy for me because i basically am retarded
  go good will hunting on their ass  kys
  fake buddhists might be my least favorite form of pseud new age doofuses need to be stopped
  had a coworker last year who brought up dante and tolstoyevsky and offered good conversation it happens dont fool yourself
  make me bitch
  what a terrible film
  i talk to them like a normal person people who treat every conversation like a competition are despicable
  how about instead of virtue signaling you say what you mean
  shes like 50 year old at this point i think women at some point go a little crazy and find these outlets
  based
  my boys wicked smaht
  when all your jokes fall flat
  sky rockets in flight oh afternoon delight
dont run into them that often but it kind of depends on what the conversation is about mostly i harass people by talking about the origins of words though last night i bored my girlfriend while i was at the hospital by speculating that the word patient comes from patiens lt suffering people probably think this sort of thing is condescending
  i love etymology anon the origins of words is some of the most interesting shit
  hide
be me  reading the idiot at work  new guy a tatted up exmarine approached me  hey bro whatcha reading  decide not to be a douchebag and just immediately assume he wouldnt understand or wouldnt be interested  start of enthusiastically  its this great book called the idiot etc etc  turns out hes deeply interested in russian lit and loves tolstoy  we discuss the death of ivan ilyich and other works beyond  the talks go beyond a surface level and we actually end up being pretty good friends  frequently seek each other out to break up the monotony at work    sometimes it goes well    previously me  meet qt  start dating  every time a book im interested in comes up shell say shes read it to impress me but beyond that our talks are just me me me  siddartha  uhh ive read it  she completely skipped the theory and practice of oligarchical collectivism in 1984 because she thought it was boring    all the women ive dated have been plebs and pseuds unfortunately i sat next to a female philosophy student who sort of clang to me who was pretty brilliant but i wasnt really attracted to her    everything sucks
revealing myself to be at all intelligent or well read is the single worst thing i can do socially once one of those degreeholding upper bougie wannabe technocrat hears that youve undertaken any form of intellectual selfimprovement they will attempt to respond in kind with a sort of performative overcompensation for experiencing a moment of narcissistic fear that you have bettered them     oh wow youre reading aristotle thats crazy because i just started listening to this podcast that goes into all these philosophical ideas and applies them to how were living today and it just blows my mind anon youd love it im sending you a link right now like they talk all about how life has whatever meaning you give to it and all religions is pretty much people just deciding that a certain way of life is better than another yeah philosophys wild
id probably be the one to get good will huntinged
  tfw went on a date or two with a literary qt but we never went anywhere  not gonna lie i was looking forward to raising our kids
  is is fascinating but one of the other reasons i like looking into it is i think it helps you remember the word in the future because you remember more about what it means which can be a little more difficult with more esoteric words
  yeah this is middleclass life now particularly if youre in your twenties and your friends have decent jobs    ill be honest since my time editing my universitys lit mag i havent met anyone with even a passing interest in either canonical capitall literature or even contemporary lit that isnt the newest patterson/baldacci/steel it is shit
  i literally adopt a bawstahn accent and start talking about being cucked by hahvahd and not going to the public library english is not my first language
i figure nobody likes to be lectured especially the normie so i stay as quiet and agreeable as i can and let them feel good for enlightening me with some literary recs
  hide your power level  always this midrange iq people pretend to be smart through their worthless stack of knowledge which they are incapable of analyzing high iq people hide the fact because it is not socially advantageous to be a bragard and know if there is a high iq person like them around they are more reserved and do not want to appear to be a midrange iq person looking like a know it all hope this helps
  spotted the middie
  how about instead of constant struggling and fighting you take a step back and breathe
   he talks to people
  how about the category you most likely belong to the imbeciles     god i hate the faggotry and pretentiousness on this board
      fucking anglo fags    ive met random people on the train reading the iliad nietzsche wallace franzen dante adorno literally anything imagineable    some guy at the restaurant i work at gave me his collection of dfw shorts
    god forbid someone recommended you a fucking podcast you slimeball plebshit    youre just a bitter and insecure homo afraid of being exposed as a pseud
    exactly dont be afraid to be one upped or corrected dont hide your passion thats cowardice engage people as equals dont think of anyone in terms of mid iq and if you do please just kill yourself youre not wanted
if youre not a pretentious arrogant douchebag many people will actually appreciate your intelligence and be happy to learn something
  theyre trying to make conversation with you indulge them next time and try not to sound like too much of a bored asshole
  overcompensation for experiencing a moment of narcissistic fear that you have bettered them  this entire post
  normie lifter friend on zuccbook asks for book recommendations  give him a list of /lit/ starter memes  nobody else posts no comments zero likes  why am i like this
  always hide and by that i mean that i never drag my own interests and opinions into the conversation unless theyre asked for but instead try to engage with with what im listening to in general i shun talk about literature because im an inarticulate stembot whose real strength is logic
  i always hide my power level my girlfriend didnt even know until we had been together for over a year
  i dont let on that i read lit cuz i cant talk about what i read for shit i wish i could but i just cant im a mumbling stumbling retard whenever i talk in general but especially when talking about what ive read pls help
  i dont feel like discussing my edgy music and book tastes with normal people i just say make up something plebby on the spot like radiohead and sartre and hope they leave me alone
  hate to break it to you but reading those authors doesnt make you well read it makes you slightly above the average retard
people keep recommending me sam harris       ahhhhhhhhhh
  if they just read casually like ya or genre fiction i dont mind that as ive read a few books like that too and i know we can talk about those if they wanted to    ive only really met two people who have read classics though and theyre the people i dont need to hide my power level from it feels so refreshing to talk with people like that as it happens so rarely but we can just skip between multiple books with enthusiasm recommendations from people like that also mean a lot more too
  its not the best out there but for a movie written by two lads who were in their late teens when they started out and wrote a film that was immensely successful because it resonated with so many people you got to give them credit for it    the blowjob joke was great
  i get it im also interested in etymology albeit in a more casual sense i remember going down that rabbit hole in college while studying english language
  well at least theyre trying to engage with a conversation
  yeah you have no genuine worldview
not related to op but one day at university i was sat in an empty classroom eating my lunch i had nothing else to do and i just wanted to read quietly i know im not exciting    after thirty minutes three girls came in and were interrupting my reading time with a loud conversation about blowjobs i was trying to continue with my book and i couldnt help but wonder why the hell theyd have this conversation when i was only a row in front of them    it got to the point where they were saying if your boy eats a lot of fruit like bananas then his cum tastes like bananas its really good etc etc and i was so uncomfortable that i just left    i didnt really want to tell anyone about it and maybe they just said that crass stuff to get me to leave the room but doesnt that count as some form of sexual harrassment
  oh no poor guy this is rape
  some people just want easy stuff theyve heard of anon its ok you tried to help he wasnt interested ive seen similar posts on facebook and try to avoid them because i know my recommendations wouldnt be what they really want sometimes theyre just vague asking for some good books but i know that i cant go out of my way and say the rise and fall of the third reich is a real page turner unputdownable 
  thanks for the sarcasm i appreciate it but honestly what is the boundary for this kind of thing i know id make people uncomfortable if i just struck up a conversation about eating pussy and there was a single girl in the room
  not him but hes unironically right you were raped next time covertly record their conversation and use it to sue the school and get them expelled im not kidding they need to be made an example of women need to shape up
  i dont think its rape if nobody forced me to have sex without consent this happened a few years ago now two of the girls dropped out and ive graduated since theres nothing i could do about it now and back then i didnt really think i could do anything about it either
    fuck off you retard reading nietzsche doesnt make you a genius but reading one 1 actual primary source philosophy book makes you literally more well read than 98 of this planets population
  i remember one guy striking up a conversation with me on the train because i was reading dostoevskys notes from underground we didnt talk much but he jokingly said some light reading huh which did make me laugh a little we said what we like about dostoevsky for a little bit and left it like that genuinely a nice little moment and i sort of wish i had more moments like that
  i know id make people uncomfortable  so did they
having coffee with an ex and her boring normie friends  the entire conversation is about their high school memories and work  they have nothing interesting or reflective to say about either its literally just recollection  at one point i get so bored i abruptly get out of my seat go for a piss and dont come back for like 10 minutes because i would rather look at art exhibits a second time than listen to this shit for a single second longer    normally im not an asshole about this stuff but fucking hell most of the time its better to humour people and let them talk about themselves whether theyre braindead normals or the organic intelligentsia then they like you and you dont have hang around with them again unless you get something out of it but anyway this is what any person who is a halfway functioning human being knows
  t b h im not a prude or anything but that kind of conversation would make me squirm too shouldve reported it when you had the chance sorry anon
  uhm no sweaty despite what your experience living in a shithole might suggest reading neetshe is not some tfw to smart ultra special boy niche interest his works along with those of kierkegaard sartre and camus are in fact some of the most widely read serious literature on earth so take off the fedora and stop sniffing your own farts lest youre willing to overdose
  i feel similarly i try and be polite and conversational but one time my brother took me to this ice cream parlour with his girlfriend and one of their friends and most of the time they were on their phone with the exception of one time my brothers girlfriend mentioned they saw a couple dogging the other day fucking in a car beside the road basically later on my brother asked me why i was so quiet and really all i could say was i just had nothing to say    my younger brothers even worse with conversation as hell have a long conversation for two people with himself its genuinely frustrating     im thinking of trying to go mute its the only true way
    n being perhaps one of the most widely read philosophers does not counteract my claim most people dont read books few people read books that arent fantasy or crime stories even fewer read nonfiction even fewer read philosophy 2 of the world pop having read a primary phil text is probably an overstatement and there is nothing wrong with this im just stating facts
  lady that drinks at the bar i work at had a heavily tattered copy of infinite jest got talking to her about it arranged to go to a gig with her
all you guys complaining about having to talk to pseuds dont realize how good you have it at least its something im in the military which is normalfag central i can guarantee you not one of my coworkers has ever heard of tolstoy or wallace
  i usually get excited that someone also wants to talk about stuff so i talk to them about it
  this is bait
    im sure socrates diogenes schoppi n and lacan would all have something interesting to say about dogging     if youre a curious person youll often find insights in the most mundane of things if youre a boring soulless parroting pseud then suddenly everything is mundane     from a cultural or sociological pov practically every facet of human behaviour is interesting
  keep grossing out my korean girlfriend with my autistic ramblings about dostoevsky and richard nixon making love in heaven  claim that dosto made me a christian but only so i can justify my wish to depopulate the anatolian peninsula and repopulate it with greek orthodox christians    tfw a living meme
yeah dude start quoting lacan the next time your brothers friends start talking about public sex acts    better yet dont even let them respond just answer for them
  hey what are you reading  tell them title  is it a mystery i love mystery books  eh its a little bit of everything     this is the usual scenario and i just try to get out of the conversation because i dont feel like explaining what literary fiction means on the rare occasion i find someone with good tastes i get really excited and try to gauge their power level and trade recommendations etc luckily i have a few close friends who read a decent amount so i have an outlet for that energy to keep me from sperging out every time someone recognizes the author i have in hand
  tripfag makes a blogpost  no one fucking cares about you kill yourself
   can i get some context on the nixondostoevsky thing
actually who are we kidding if you really want to solve this problem you should just become a sociologist that way you will never have a boring conversation in your life again because you can just make everything about humans a fascinating conversational topic that has nothing to do with the critical contribution of your interlocutors    also to that other guy do you know who i am
  but im not always looking for insight in the mundane sometimes you just want to connect with someone socially and thats not always easy if you dont share a mutual interest of clacking away at your phone and mentioning how this one time you saw someone get a blowjob in a car behind sainsburys

  coincidentally just started reading the autobiography a few days ago apparently his views on whites on separation and on elijah muhammad were changing drastically near the end of his life which is why noi assassinated him im still not too clear on the particulars but he seems like an outspoken and thoughtful personality
  yeah his opinions change towards the end of the book and he even feels a remorse for the white people who tried to help him but he had refused their efforts he definitely grew a lot as a person and i think its a shame he was assassinated he even knew the noi would come after him
   i have only one friend who reads anything beyond your usual assortment of ya fiction nothing too heavy but still refreshing compared to your usual voracious reader     an old friend of mine enrolled in english lit and his critical analysis skills unironically went downhill i havent heard him uttering an argument more nuanced than this book is great because it deals with complex societal issues by which he means either racism/feminism or a superficial understanding of identity

none original or gtfo
  reading poetry in anything but the original  holy fuck why would you do something like this
    because i cant read german you dumb fucks
why bother reading it if not in german    just read marlowes version
  that version sucks and you and i both know it
  i should note that i did read that version and i wasnt particularly impressed im not op but i was hopeing goethes would be better
  i too would like to know would be nice if there were some translation chart like the divine comedy has
  because why not surely the english version isnt that bad
luke because kaufmann never translated all of part 2 and lukes introduction to part 2 is a great essay to read after you finish

never read a japanese novel and this sounds like it could be a fun lighthearted read  thoughts
  its pretty good  it feels like it did not need to be as long as it is and mild spoilers but its a cat novel so really you already know how its going to end the ending completely limpdicked its intended emotional effect for me but overall i enjoyed it

this man is your friend  naomi portrait of shunkin the tattooer diary of a mad old man even quicksand in a way he just doesnt stop writing about this  if youre able to read japanese you can check out some of his untranslated short stories as well
  one title that you would recommend   and whats his name 
  its tanizaki junichiro read naomi but be prepared to suffer the tattooer is a great short story about obsession the artist and his relation to his works of art but might be a bit difficult and maybe too allegorical for your taste i dont know exactly what youre looking for if you can read japanese id recommend 少年 a nice short story about transgression and punishment it has nice imagery a secret chamber and a terrifying illusion  or is it real

  im curious about your experience man i have vague memories of getting girls to slap me in the face as early as primary school sadly it stopped as i got less innocent but i feel like porn has taken my proclivities and modulated them exacerbated them sent them towards their worst possible expression early last year i went to a dominatrix but i left like 20 minutes in because it just felt uncomfortable and perfunctory as fuck since then ive been smoking pretty much every day fantasizing about dominatrix heaps and theres a weird kinda symbiosis between the weed and the dominatrix that lives inside me had time off this year and i dont fantasize about a murderous succubus then literally as soon as i hit a bong those fantasies come in at times its like ive been jerking it to my own negative thoughts personified as a sexy destroyertype woman saying youre worthless nobodys gonna love you  going strong on two days off pot this time i gotta make it or i think i might go insane    i just want to arrive at a state where i can authentically express myself into the world around me where i can talk to some girl i like without all these strange layers of selfassertion and selfdenial

which ones of these dont have cucking

  nice
  do you or any others in this thread have advice on getting a mommy gf are they really out there in the world or merely in the minds of us sadboys online a real being or a construct weve created     please answer
  also amerika
  what kind of femdom stuff like just physical abuse or typical leather and whips    ive found my femdom fetish to creep through in very weird ways for instance i like women who are typically older than me generally around 5 years had a fwb that was 12 years older plus im into fucking fat ass women again they have more mass than i do and have a bit of a leg up on me in that sense ive always had a fascination with queens and their younger male servants
i am ambivalent about femdomfags who see their fetish as a disorder or as something to be suppressed on the one hand i feel like a fetish is a fetish and you might as well learn to enjoy it responsibly and safely with a partner who understands that its a retarded kink you cant help end of story     on the other hand porn absolutely does make it spiral into crazy subvariants over time worse though i seem to be relatively lucky compared to what other femdom dudes experience im always surprised when i see how oddly specific and stereotyped other guys version of the fetish is but my mind is absolutely blown whenever i see guys for whom the fetish crosses over invasively into their real life i thought my version of the kink must be the majority relatively mild stuff that is easily sequestered to roleplaying in my sex life and then the more extreme guys would be proportionately rarer along a standard bell curve instead the standard version of having a femdom fetish seems to be that youre into really really stereotyped mommydom roleplay or over the top venusian dominatrices with huge pendulous breasts and it absolutely cannot be confined to the bedroom but needs to be indulged 24/7 and the girl herself has to specifically embody the mommydom archetype and if the dude resists his inclinations then this sort of shit happens  where it bleeds into his personal life     im into my own share of weird and specific stuff but it all easily fits within a normal dating life and my femdom kink doesnt have anything to do with my personality or selfconfidence or lifestyle all my instincts tell me this should be the most common vanilla variant of femdom fetishism but apparently its not the case
  are you saying theres something wrong with me for wanting a mommy gf i dont anything degrading or painful just a mommy
  femdom  c r i n g e
  like just physical abuse or typical leather and whips  both and more  i dont have much time to really get into it now but things like being confined made to feel pain in various ways ruined orgasms forced to satisfy her needs passed around and made to provide orgasms for her friends etc  not a meeting occurs that i dont leave her dorm bleeding   if theres interest i can probably sit here and type up a better report tomorrow
  larp
  then literally as soon as i hit a bong those fantasies come in  wow its almost like smoking dope isnt such a good idea
i dont why some people think that this fetish is wrong its very fulfilling to submit control and lay back

mark  no turkey jeremy you fuckhead you total fucking shithead  jez  it was a joke mark a christmas joke   idk what book but thats my favourtite peep show moment  i swear its the only geniunely good tv show the only one that has something to say about the human condition    i feel like fathers and sons by turgenev has kinda similar vibes in that mark/jez and arkady/bazarov both kinda represent opposite aspects of youth one side mark and arkady is precocious timid wants to be initiated by the mystery of life and find a place in the world as it is while the other jez and bazarov wants to forcefully apply its own idiosyncrasy give nothing of itself away make a mark and be an individual    russian lit has some farreaching influences they allude to dosto in the office uk and gervais charged intense awkwardness is imo clearly influenced by dostoevskys work
    i was just thinking earlier how peep show is the closest well ever get to britain as being on the same levels as the works of houllebecq i feel like mark and jeremy would fit in nicely with houllebecqs cast

stop being ironic
  i never was in the first place
  then whyd ya make an ironic post  better kys
  what was ironic about my post maybe youre projecting
im trying ive used it to cope for a long time
dfw himself was profoundly ironic and hiding behind multiple veneers of selfdeprecation in his nonfiction
how does one respond to irony
    why are people here so retarded    more irony
  funny you should mention it
  but i wasnt being ironic ironically
  this but ironically
  irony is fine its intentions are very clear make fun of something you disagree with by slightly exaggerating its qualities pointing out its flaws    postirony is cancer though
of literature i could say irony is its heart and that it takes scarcely a pulse to say so and even less reading to think
  isnt ij postironic
  and the greatest irony of all the ironies is that it was not ironic at all
  the only thing i like about dfw is that you guys are posting pics with this absolute comfy 90s aesthetics
  shut up john green i dont have to listen to you
  remember when he said he supposedly went to a fancy dinner on the cruise ship and wore a tshirt that looked like a suit jacket and made all the fancy old ladies upset that was a yikes
  is she 12
i heard that dfw killed himself after realizing the office did what he was trying to do better than he did is this true
  yeah
  yeah year by year day by day the realization that he was a hackfraud grew ever larger in his mind until there was only one option left
  this and i even find him really fun to read
  irony is just an acknowledgement that people dont always mean what they say desu it doesnt have anything to do with identity or authenticity
stop pontificating dave
  dfw means irony in literature same with sincerity the sincere and ironic voice are both utilized in fiction but the ironic voice is much more useful while sincerity comes off as whiny and sentimental
  this but unironically
  dfw was an inauthentic fraud pretending to be sincere nothing he wrote was sincere not even his supposed nonfiction essays which even his friends acknowledge included plenty of characters and material that were made up to push a narrative dfw is the quintessential nepotistic academic projecting tryhard
new sincerity  what did he mean by this
    good old neon  octet    the struggle for authenticity is a major theme of dfws fiction have you read these stories they explore how sincerity/authenticity can exist in the face of crippling selfconsciousness
ayo there is one all loving god and this kike on this stick died for our sins oh and if you do not believe this you will burn in hell with the devil who is the cause of all evil but is not part of god because god is all loving  is christcuckery the least intellectual and least aesthetic religion
  it has been dumbed down and distorted for the masses but the key message of jesuss teachings was a more mystical wake up this is divine right here and now the bliss and freedom of god is within you and then this became propped up as an institution which over time changed under this understanding hell is more a state of ignorance or separation from god mundane existence and normal stress could all be considered hellish in comparison to the tranquility of being united with the lord many christians seem to get offended when you imply that it has been somehow misunderstood or that it had this more radically mystic bent but generally the views of many christian mystics often seem to roughly align with this
jesus was a mushroom
  yes religion is retarded now stop shitting up my lit
it probably is but what makes it so intriguing is how much women flock to it and how pious some of them get i tell you nothing screams dick hungry more than an extremely pious and faithful woman

  souls arent real theyre just products of cultural marxism
  because people arent starving and murdering as much  this isnt even true pinker cherry picks data hard core to suggest otherwise fewer people are starving as a percentage of the population but because the population is so much larger more people are actually starving

all thats happened is suffering has been exported outsourced the underclass is now brown people on the other side of the globe as opposed to labourers mulling about the humid moggy streets and dirty little urchins scampering about the cities the spectacle of public punishment and torture has been phased out too another displacement of suffering from the everyday eye now the standard judicial sentence is sexual torture behind closed bars in isocubes lifelong hidden places out of sight out of mind the mentally ill and disabled aborted out of existence or should that fail sequestered into wards yesteryear freak shows in their gritty ugly spectacle are more inclusive and lifeaffirming than todays abstraction of disability the disabled are only to be witnessed in compassionate contexts for the moral sanctification of the voyeur fetish objects taken in low doses medicalised apportioned restrained in a comfortable context drone warefare queers are no longer deviant they are simply heterosexualimitations getting married cleaving themselves to dying bourgeois institutions sanitised au revoir thebes bonjour neil patrick harris

  a good chance of sudden death from total war  that still exists today whole world could go up in flames at the push of a few buttons  also having problems with the modern world doesnt mean you have to go and live in a cave or whatever  although that would be better than this trash    only good thing about living int he modern world is that i can read classic literature and listen to heavy metal on an unprecedented scale and if id never heard of that shit i wouldnt miss it
reading the scholastics and then the early moderns helped me realise why the latter had a completely legitimate critique against the whole enterprise and not everything can be dismissed with well you just dont understand aristotle properly
  imagine the absolute state of not understanding the most basic modernist critique of the enlightenment pinkers biggest crime is simply being outdated
  this ive become quite charitable by my admittedly cursory dabbling in both dismissing neither the scholastics nor early modern philosophers out of hand as some secularists and christfags respectively are wont to do

redpill me on campbell /lit/
  he was the chap who turned me onto spenglers decline of the west said it was the book that got him and his wife married     i respect the hell out of him even if i dont 100 agree with everything he says his point that modern society lacks maturity rituals for men is spot on its part of the reason why so many adults are stuck in a state of arrested development his knowledge of other cultures myths is mesmerizing to read     give him a shot op hes the best example of conservative cultural critique in literature he makes no value judgments when describing other cultures myths like a good scholar should but he also doesnt shy away from critique modern society using accumulated knowledge from our past so many lefty scholars today seem to think that old  bad no matter what campbell puts a pin in that fallacious way of thinking
  oh boofuckinghoo i get to sit sround guzzling sodas and playing vidyagames rather than being some peasant farm labourer man
  hes the best example of conservative cultural critique in literature  he seems rather apolitical to me      fuck off back to 
  notice you couldnt refute my point you wannabee aristocrat
  based
  its true    all these waaahhh life sucks people are forgetting just how fucking awful life has been for most people throughout most of history    i live better than a medieval king ffs
  interesting  campbell and bill moyers did a public tv series that made campbell famous  george lucas really loved his books lucas was the worst student in high school but he survived a car wreck the day before graduation  he got into usc and was a legendary student  lucas was so far ahead of other directors because hes great with technology and he understood campbell
    its not a materialistic critique you braindead corn syrup machine since you outed yourself it means you will never build something great which you are content with it literally means you are the contemporary version of that peasant farmer you dip but that doesnt matter because you embrace your insulin dopamine cage do you the pretense is that contemporary mans needs are easily met now reaching for a refinement in different aspects of existence besides the carnal
    its not about waaahhh life sucks you petulant manchild its about the fact that life has lost any meaning making it a perfect place for nihilstic babies for you to thrive
  its about the fact that life has lost any meaning making it a perfect place for nihilstic babies  this campbell doesnt say this outright but he does heavily imply it i picked up pic related at a used bookstore many years ago and read through it in two sittings i remember there was a chapter where he talks about the importance of ritual to young men specifically    basically women dont need it because they have obvious biological markers that indicate phases in life specifically your period and menopause a woman is always thinking about her life in terms of her biological clock in a way that a man isnt men can still reproduce at the age of 5060 while most women cannot whether or not they should is another matter entirely     thus ancient society solved this problem by creating manhood rituals to force a man to see himself as an adult he also stressed the importance of ritual as a means of defining oneself in the olden days a man was defined almost entirely by his profession butcher baker etc we even see artifacts of this in surnames nowadays people flit from job to job not tying themselves down to any one identity they are trapped in a perpetual state of adolescence lacking definition and thus concrete character    give this a read if you have a chance op i cant remember if everything i said was in this particular book but definitely the stuff about the importance of rituals was there

  spenglers decline of the west said it was the book that got him and his wife married  literally the only man to ever read that book and have sex lmao
  interesting this reminds me of a passage in the mystery of the grail where evola said men must seek the holy grail to achieve apotheosis whereas women already possess it but dont see the point of it
  cringe
  hes great if you live in the west and havent read him youre missing out dont take his analysis in comparative mythology as an excuse to formulate your own christianity however it isnt all metaphors and psychological symbols       many years ago after watching the bill moyers interview transcribed in the power of myth i read the hero with a thousand faces around then i also read homer for the second time and robert graves the greek myths ivanhoe and sir gawain and the green knight you would do well to read malory also and the epic of gilgamesh after that was done i continued with campbells the masks of god a four volume set it was at this time i also began seriously reading the bible i had read some buddhist texts years earlier as a teenager and campbell goes over some eastern mythology especially kali but that is not my heritage here is where campbell goes into jung a bit i have not read as much jung as i should but man and his symbols was a good introduction the first part of the book is great some of the later essays by his students are not the red book is a mystical work ive been putting off until after ive read aion hoellers the gnostic jung is an indispensable companion to campbells masks of god frazers the golden bough is also mentioned frequently along with pausanias mostly to reference traditions of a specific time and place those are worth reading for themselves as well    tldr campbell is comfy reading if you want to read campbell be sure you want to read a lot more too
  degenerated jungs work desu
  i live better than a medieval king   this fucking meme some wagecuck lives better than a man who had a vast territory at his feet and could get away with anything because he has a refrigerator
  saying life is better than x is quite ridiculous  everyone suffers and other than specific times where it was particularly worse to be a part of a subjugated demographic on an individual level it all depends on your given genetic structure and the way it interacts with a given environment  most likely there were many kings and queens who had experienced larger quantities of neuroticism than either you or me
  that quote is so dumb i genuinely started feeling depressed for him i hope he is dead so that he could find some kind of piece from his massive brainletism
  he was a smart boy but his faith fell more on hinduism than christianity  were it otherwise he could have been the next kierkegard

thoughts on this is it worth reading
  isnt this the supposed masterpiece of french lit
  its great cosettemarius romance is some cringe trash but everything else is good
  no that would be prousts little book
  yeah but nobody has read that one
  its essentially ya but it is engaging    the 60 page chapter on the history of sewers in france is a highlight
  the 60 page chapter on the history of sewers in france is a highlight  that sounds like my kind of shit
  lol nope x    yes it is it is really really really good one of the most meaningful novels ive ever read
  why do you type like a teenage girl anon
it contains no meritorious ideas hugo clearly padded it to 34x its original length if you want to create a list of unverifiable facts about 19th century france its great
  the 60 page chapter on the history of sewers in france is a highlight  sounds simply based
  because through famililarity ive imitated the style of my favorite person in the world 
  but no one thats not a /lit/tard even knows who proust is everyone knows about victor hugo and les mis even here in amerimutt land
  its very good
    its really interesting to me how much the values of readers change over time    in the 1800s you were supposed to root for cosette and marius but almost everyone today sympathizes more with eponine even though hugo didnt spend nearly as much time with her character    and in frankenstein a lot of people hate frankenstein and sympathize with the monster but at the time the fact that the monster murdered a child made him completely irredeemable
  this cosette is really the only uninteresting character
  yes its honestly one of the greatest things ive ever read itll take a good three or so months to finish but its phenomenal its so full of wonderful details i want to say everything i love about the book but ill be spoiling it so ill just summarise a few parts vaguely   that part when jean valjean tells cosette to play with the doll he bought her but her life of abuse from the thenardiers leaves her confused as to what playing is   marius relationship with his grandfather being destroyed leaving his grandfather resentful but eventually guilty that his only grandson is out there and could be dead and eventually he is desperate for marius forgiveness but is too proud and unsure of how to apologise to him   tfw thenardier tells marius about how wonderful a man jean valjean really is    the book will fucking floor you op as long as youre patient and allow yourself to get swept up into it theres some fairly long digressions that victor hugo cant stop himself from going into waterloo paris sewers etc but they serve as a good contextualisation of the chapters that return to the central narrative so you can understand how labyrinthine the sewers might be or the importance of fighting against the authorities or whatever    its honestly one of the greatest books ive ever read and unfortunately i think the length of it puts people off youre not even halfway by the time you reach 700 pages in but free up your reading schedule put everything aside and just dive in
ive read the windup bird chronicle and kafka on the shore and i liked them so much particularly kafka that i asked for dance dance dance the elephant vanishes and norwegian wood for christmas ive also heard good things about 1q84 but that one seems a bit dense
  ive also heard good things about 1q84  youve been hearing wrong
  dance is sequel to sheep chase i strongly recommend you do not read it before sheep
    iq84 has some interesting ideas but not 1000 pages worth of them i dont recommend it stick to his shorter stuff
i love dosto but this is unironically his weakest novel     hugs and good feelings are a rational basis for resource allocation    and this is from the guy who wrote demons    i can understand the spiritual side to his arguments thats what drew me to him but as a student of political his critique of utilitarianism in this book especially where raskolnikov gets all pissy at luzhin is retarded luzhin is based and his views towards marriage are alpha af does dosto know about the importance of price as a signalling mechanism for the best use of scarce resources has he even read wealth of nations    my verdict this book is gay
  student of political economy
  his weakest novel  but that isnt the idiot and thats taking novel to mean not including his shorter stories  demons  cp  bk  the gambler  the idiot  everything else
  the idiot  weak  shit taste t b h
  i dont read dostoevsky for romcoms
  everything else  you clearly havent read enough dosto to make these remarks
if i thought crime n punishment was kind of boring will i enjoy his other books i read the pv translation i didnt like how chunky the writing was and the way people acted didnt seem realistic or something
  demons tbk and the idiot are less melodramatic but some exaggeration is just dostoyevskys style to be honest you will learn to appreciate it once you read more of his books
why would you recommend me this
secular eschatology
btfos reductionism  what next bros
can you really say that you can write anything without first experiencing the ecstacy and agony of love is art birthed in the absence of direct experience of the real meaningful in any sense aside from being a pursuit of it
  saying that you can write  not just writing
    i meant can you say anything meaningful of course anyone can write if they truly will it but will what they produce be anything more than an idealization or even degradation of the real if they havent experienced the thing in itself
  direct experience of the real
chapter 99 the doubloon    what did you think of it also what are your favorite chapters from the book
i havent read it but it sucks
  also what are your favorite chapters from the book  the one about whales
  but seriously the last one
  cetology is unironically one of the best chapters in the book
all the chapters in the book are masterpieces but if i had to choose one it would be the symphony
sum up sam hyde and varg vikernes philosophical views
theyre comedians not philosophers
hyde  if you stare long enough into the abyss the abyss stares back into you  varg  be the change you want to see in the world
sam hyde cares more about milking money from paypigs and obfuscating his bluebloodeastcoastartschool pedigree than actually getting a message across     varg just wants everyone who isnt blonde haired  blue/green eyed to die also an avid welfare recipient
  sam  the jews are ruining society  varg  society is the jew
  there is nothing wrong with welfare you have a moral obligation to pay a little taxes as possible and divert as much money away from the government as possible to yourself
sam hyde is diogenes if diogenes were a child rapist    varg is like a juvenile unintelligent nietzsche oh wait thats just nietzsche
  sam  evola  varg  guenon but pagan
  there is nothing wrong with welfare  ayo preach it my brotha gotta get dem gibs
  comparing nonwhite welfare queens is a false equivalency regardless your criticism is founded upon boomer consumerist platitudes anyway
  comparing nonwhite welfare queens is a false equivalency  welfare queens are welfare queens varg is an excon who has a brood of kids and is proud of being on welfare sounds like a welfare queen to me youre being intellectually dishonest
  youre being intellectually dishonest  nope just again pointing out an obvious false equivalency what you use the money for and who it goes to are obviously essential factors
  an obvious false equivalency  how is it a false equivalency because im throwing stones at your beloved internet daddy figure hes an ex con with more children than common sense who lives off welfare thats a welfare queen
  more children than common sense  gee i wonder who could be behind this post
  how is it a false equivalency  varg is white and welfare isnt used to make dependent on liberal parties any money not going to varg is going to be used by the government to fund white genocide
  any money not going to varg is going to be used by the government to fund white genocide  ah i see nothing to see here folks just another schizo antisemite snowflake dont  me again
why was wittgenstein already a wittgenstein at such a young age just look at his eyes his look was the same throughout all of his life how is this possible for an infant to look so adult its like hes looking at his mother behind the photographer waiting for her to get out until he starts taking a photo
  why was wittgenstein already a wittgenstein at such a young age    time is cyclical duh

  what a head of hair on that baby
  high iq people especially jews are already mentally and emotionally superior to low iq white adults as soon as they stop weaning youre just subhuman and dont understand what its like to have a higher reading and quantitative reasoning capacity than an 18 year old whigger at that age which is fine youre statistically unlikely to be have been privy to that experience because youre a dumb animal and so were your parents and theirs going back to the peasant race that equally subhuman steppe niggers conquered to create your whole abominable line

  goddamit why the fuck did those european retards have to unknowingly apply eugenics to this very religious group of people whom they despised

whats the best bible translation for a non christian if being a christian doesnt matter then what is the bible recommended by most
kjv
av/kjv
    okay got it why is kjv better than the rest just wondering
    old timey but very poetic if you want something more accessible go with the nkjv
  okay ill just get both and see what i like uh what about the niv
  its poetic as the other anon said others are just plain to read that really matters to my because my mother tongue is poetic af
  nrsv do not get the kjv
  why
  its the christcuck translation if you want to read the bible as a literary text get the nrsv
  this is the one i have it is pretty good
  kjv is not only comfy and artistic it is also the cornerstone and building block of all great western literature past the 1600s and youll find allusions to kings powerful language and quotes everywhere in those works it is also much more entertaining to read whereas if you read genesis in niv youre much more likely to give up reading it feels impotent not only in comparison to kjv but as it stands alone as well    currently reading the old testament and am halfways through exodus and ive also checked out the psalms and im like obsessed with the fucking book now
niv for ease of understanding kjv for preserving the artistic merit of the writing
  also worth adding im not religious at all but getting a better i mean a fundamental grasp on christianity and judaism is somehow enjoyable    also to blow the kjv a bit more its ominous af in some parts i say get the norton critical edition of the kjv old testanent you get great footnotes as well as great introductions and criticisms and all that as well as an attractive layout
  can we stop this kjv is hard to understand meme
  its nowhere as easy to follow as niv
niv is forprofit copyrighted protestant propaganda    if youre not going to read vatican approved translations ie ones with imprimatur and nihil obstat then at least read the kjv
osb
i honestly think nasb is the best modern translation something about the language sits very right with me
    the new oxford annotated bible with apocrypha new revised standard version
  wtf i love the niv now
  based    recently got this and its really got
is buddhism comparable to advaita vedanta are there any literary works that reconcile the two philosophies
  yes sure theyre both about primordial chilling    maybe lao tzu reconciles them shankara was ocd as fuck
  advaita is just one school with some very minor variation among its subschools buddhism includes a really wide spectrum of views and doctrines some of which are very different from advaita while certain other buddhist ideas are very close to it in general its the mahayana that is closest to advaita in particular its teachings about buddhamatrix/tathagatagarbha there are a range on views on this subject within the various sects of mahayana itself some sects go with an intepretation of it more closer to advaita and others dont for example those who view the ultimate reality/buddha essence as still empty itself are more removed from vedanta while the buddhist sects that dont regard this as empty are very close to advaita these particular branches of mahayana could largely be reconciled with advaita but with something like theravada it would be more of a stretch    literary works that reconcile  some people have written on how they align on many levels although its not a huge focus of research generally instead of trying to synthesize them an author will typically approach one from the view of the other the best book on this subject is probably coomaraswamys book hinduism and buddhism      shankara was ocd as fuck    what makes you say that
  what is your response to someone who only reads the pali texts tipitaka and early commentary
  what is your response to someone who only reads the pali texts tipitaka and early commentary    i dont have any problem with that those texts alone offer very valuable lessons there is some possibility that some doctrines taught by buddha were preserved well in mahayana so i wouldnt totally rule all nonpc stuff out some scholars have noted that there is some contradictory stuff in the pc which doesnt really align with the rest and theyve concluded that the most reasonable explanation for it being there is that when the canon was compiled those verses were considered part of the authentic oral tradition and thus too respected and venerable to be dispensed with despite them not aligning with the rest of the canon the implication of this is that the pc does not fully capture the message of all of buddhas teachings which is not to say these were hidden in the first place and that there may have been stuff passed down orally outside of the pc but which still came from buddha which is what many of the mahayana sutras tathagatagarbha sutras etc claim     if this were true the model of the pc being most accurate 100 buddhism and then everything after that becoming farther from buddhas teachings wouldnt necessarily be true rather there could be an indeterminate number of buddhas teachings transmitted orally which flourished in the mahayana tradition and during the exploration of these ideas over centuries any one thinker or several thinkers could have perhaps been the ones to understand it just like buddha did so there is a lot more ambiguity to what buddha actually taught than what people often assume the understanding of the early commentators themselves is sometimes not even clear because in some cases you have later buddhist commentators arguing about what the earlier ones actually meant     so if you just stick to those texts you listed there is a chance you might miss something buddha taught but in the end its for you to decide if you dont enjoy reading other texts than dont force yourself to
  this guy is the bomb he was originally born into a brahmin family and has been retreat for a lifetime  in this video he explains the difference between buddhism and hinduism    but some of the hindu saints are also buddhist saints  look up the mahasiddhas

warlock of the magus world is my favorite chinkshit    i like it because it has a main character that western authors would never ever get away with he constantly tortures people to death for their souls or some shit also really enjoy western cultivation systems/ names for whatever reason the first few arcs are fantastic if you like them try the later ones which are imo not nearly as good     has anyone read library of heavens path tell me your thoughts im looking for something to read i dropped renegade immortal because i cant find a pdf    also 动态网自由门 天安門 天安门 法輪功 李洪志 free tibet 六四天安門事件 the tiananmen square protests of 1989 天安門大屠殺 the tiananmen square massacre 反右派鬥爭 the antirightist struggle 大躍進政策 the great leap forward 文化大革命 the great proletarian cultural revolution 人權 human rights 民運 democratization 自由 freedom 獨立 independence 多黨制 multiparty system 台灣 臺灣 taiwan formosa 中華民國 republic of china 西藏 土伯特 唐古特 tibet 達賴喇嘛 dalai lama 法輪功 falun dafa 新疆維吾爾自治區 the xinjiang uyghur autonomous region 諾貝爾和平獎 nobel peace prize 劉暁波 liu xiaobo 民主 言論 思想 反共 反革命 抗議 運動 騷亂 暴亂 騷擾 擾亂 抗暴 平反 維權 示威游行 李洪志 法輪大法 大法弟子 強制斷種 強制堕胎 民族淨化 人體實驗 肅清 胡耀邦 趙紫陽 魏京生 王丹 還政於民 和平演變 激流中國 北京之春 大紀元時報 九評論共産黨 獨裁 專制 壓制 統一 監視 鎮壓 迫害 侵略 掠奪 破壞 拷問 屠殺 活摘器官 誘拐 買賣人口 遊進 走私 毒品 賣淫 春畫 賭博 六合彩 天安門 天安门 法輪功 李洪志 free tibet 劉曉波动态网自由门
  whats so based and also redpilled about this series
  just read a few chink webnovels and youll know
  library of heavens path is one of the best translated chinkshit out there i followed the novel since it only have 8 chapters at the time now its 1k chapters   i also read ahead some machine translations the plot is promising
  its just about a guy given a tool that grants him instant knowledge when he touches a book and he uses that to face slap people its an okay popcorn novel but its always the same shit and its boring now
  every chinkshit is a popcorn novel
    you want ma jian but youll get magical realism instead of real fantasy
  way of kings  cringe  havent read the sad tale of brothers grossbart but the rest are varying degrees of good
  way of kings  its unique nevertheless
  why is mr hitler there
i dont read chinkshit but i did read cradle which is inspired by chinkshit is any actual chinkshit as good or better     makes them sound pretty bad lindon doesnt even have some innate overpowered advantage over everyone besides weaponized autism
    what the fuck is this shit meme
  something the chinese government wont like
  not chinkshit but sufficiently advanced magic is similar to cradle
  you get shut down harder than a goyim by the jews if you expose chinks to any of those words   they are harder on news or freedom than stalin or the us ever would be
  underlord when please based will wight
i just finished reading the night land by william hope hodgson and i am going to talk about it a little because another anon was a few threads back everything from this line  and i knew that they made some great preparation in the pyramid for our defence for all the night did begin now to shake and to quiver with the mighty beat of the earthcurrent  and onwards more than made up for the slow parts preceding it my fucking face when pic related   the setting and descriptions and overall tone of the book was great there were some ideas in here that are still unique even to this day at least as far as ive read i enjoyed the archaic prose and i even enjoyed some of the narrators teenagertier lovesickness for his waifu his fixation on her feet was pretty funny a lot of people gave this book shit for being almost half filled with him thinking about and interacting with his lover and not really doing anything to advance the story but it really didnt bother me i managed to stay hooked and invested all the way through   seriously those last 20 pages were nervewracking i was really pissed off when his waifu apparently died at the foot of the pyramid and i kept waiting for her to get better but she didnt i really thought the narrator was gonna kill himself at her funeral but then she did get better and i felt an actual sense of relief i cant remember the last time i got so invested in the outcome of a book a close to a 10/10 as i might ever find will read again in a few years
  yeah that was insane hype hodgson knew you had to temper the darkness with light i didnt really mind the slow parts especially when theres some new wonder when they find an ancient airship sticking out of a cliff or reminisce about when a mighty civilization built a road down into the canyon the great redoubt is in glad you enjoyed the prose too its 10/10 pleb filter    making a tree scary
/sffg/ would you consider a man cooking wooden boards until they became not only edible but delicious to be a feat of magic    i still want to write it as rocks but i want to draw at least partially from real life
  wooden boards are completely unpalletable in real life so yes
  i went on goodreads after i finished to see what the normies thought amusing how so many couldnt handle the prose or the narrators attitude towards women  the tree   the tree was spooky and so was the hummock from earlier on the scariest monster was the house of silence for me the watchers are runners up   new wonders  i think the most interesting tidbit we got was the cities that moved ever westward on rails because earths rotation had slowed so much its kind of scary when you think about what might be in that yearlong night they were fleeing im pretty sure the monsters began to appear before the sun was extinguished i also wish wed gotten more about the flying ships too but im kind of glad he didnt go overboard on the details and bog down the story either   have you read john c wrights night land stories i really like this setting but i dont want the mystery or atmosphere hodgson created to be ruined by someone trying to merely cash in on his work or trying to pay tribute to it and failing to grasp what made it great in the first place
  wooden boards are extremely palletable in real life
  why do you hurt me so anon i was just trying to make a joke
  the narrators attitude towards women  its all so tiresome the same people that go its the future so of course everyones gay cant handle the future having trad values in a survival situation  the scariest monster was the house of silence for me  i think thats because it cranks the horror all the way to psychological where everything else is 50/50 you automatically expect it to be that much worse to make up for it not being grotesque  have you read john c wrights night land stories  im the anon who recommended them a few threads ago jcw has been praised by many different authors for his ability to copy style  he doesnt go full hodgson in his prose but it is ornate and it comes from love of the story not love of money and he does grasp what makes it great especially in the first and third stories
  i was just trying to finish it for you
  
  thats pretty cool
what do people have against brandon sanderson here im reading mistborn right now and its pretty fun so far

any good recommendations for reactionary genreshit
  pulp masters howard and brackett and merritt moderns try to turn pulp into a synonym for poor quality then they give jemisin another hugo i prefer pulp masters to modern reactionaries since theyre writing with a completely different set of priors no matter how wellmeaning contemporary authors are they let 21st century thought in
  whats the best compilation of howards work and can you redpill me on the other 2 what did they write about
  as far as i know theres not a full compilation of howard the coming of conan the cimmerian is the best way to get into conan leigh brackett was a huge howard fan and tried to imitate him her eric john stark stories are sort of conan meets john carter but theyre angrier both of those have a lot of commentary on the nature of civilization and barbarism both also have a lot of other stuff thats good but im not familiar with though i can tell you howards boxing stories are excellent    a merritt was a bigtime editor but wrote some good stuff on his own not as much active commentary but more the preconceptions he works from are reactionary since everyone was in 1930 theres a bunch of other good pulp authors as well predilection for crazy adventures and thrift of wordcount i think there was a clark ashton smith fan around here a while ago ive read a few of his stories and can recommend grandeur respect for monarchy that sort of thing
  i made the vast majority of these threads since inception but nice job taking credit faggot
  some guy uploaded renegade immortal on mobilism so you could read it as an epub if you wanted  library of heavens path is ok but lol hes like 500 chapters behind in translating
more like conan

  masters of rome
  back to /pol/    weve already won    
  i like how most of the comments are talking about how racist that book series is lmao
  mfw rey diaz was right all along      its very good albeit a bit dark and depressing absolutely amazing hardsci makes you think  only criticism is that its a bit slow at times and that character development or evolution is not the strongest suit of the author which favours worldbuilding poetic descriptions of thoughts and complexity of the narrative instead youll have dozens of characters interacting in complicated ways but few of them will be fully developed
  see 
buy my book mofugging whyteboi
  i read the dark forest and the ending closes the story in a way that it doesnt feel like there should be a third book i tried reading deaths end but the story was all over the place with a bunch of side stories that werent particulary interesting compared to the wallfacers     is dark forest the peak of the series and deaths end just and extremely long epilogue
  dont know i didnt read deaths end yet but im definitively going to
  yeah ill just go ahead and delete all the epubs i have of her
   at the very northern tip of manhattan lies one of the last wild places in new york city a swath of ancient forest that has survived more or less undisturbed for hundreds of years on an overcast afternoon the park is relatively quiet save for the occasional squawk of migrating geese and the distant groan of the metronorth winding up the hudson a solitary jogger lopes along a dirt path edging the dense woods i love this park because its the last of the forest as it used to be before we showed up and fucked up everybodys shit fantasy writer nk jemisin tells me as we set off through the woods her hands tucked pensively into the pockets of a long gray cardigan after a moment she adds an important caveat well i mean technically my ancestors werent fucking anybody up they were just being fucked up that said   she drifts off her eyes on the red oaks overhead reality always creeps into jemisins fantasies whether she wants it to or not     were here on a research expedition to gather details for a scene in her new trilogy which she describes as a magical battle for the soul of new york city over the last decade jemisin a former practicing psychologist has become one of the worlds most acclaimed authors of science fiction and fantasy known for crafting richly imagined fantastical realms and melding elements like mysterious sentient floating crystals with searing critiques of contemporary political power structures for her new book she wanted to write something light and fun  a palate cleanser about tentacled monsters  but jemisin can never stay away from heavy themes for long partway through her first draft it dawned on her that the new book was really about gentrification and racism i just want to write about things blowing up gods and planets and moons crashing into things she tells me but what i write ends up being very political if i write about dragons im writing about dragons as a black woman and its fucking political
  reading her garbage books in the first place  then again i cant talk
  jemisins phenomenal success has been something like an earthquake ripping through the traditional order of fantasy itself perhaps this explains why certain writers nearly all of them white men have taken issue with her rise but more on that later all together her work has sold a million copies in english and has been translated into 24 languages tnt is developing it as a tv show in 2016 the opening book in the trilogy won the hugo award for best novel science fiction and fantasys most prestigious honor she was the first black writer to win this award though she doesnt see this as a milestone worth celebrating it just emphasizes how flawed the field has always been she says the following year she won the hugo again this years win made her the first writer of any race to claim the award three years in a row for each book in a trilogy for perspective george rr martin has been nominated in that category four times but has never won neil gaiman a fan of jemisins and one of fantasys most bankable stars has won only twice the demands of success have not disrupted her torrid writing pace when shes on deadline jemisin aims for 3000 words a day and has managed to publish ten books in just the past eight years her latest how long til black future month out this week is a collection of short stories her first book to be released in hardback
what new information does fire and blood offer that we didnt know yet
  perhaps this explains why certain writers nearly all of them white men have taken issue with her rise
  i just want to write about things blowing up gods and planets and moons crashing into things she tells me but what i write ends up being very political if i write about dragons im writing about dragons as a black woman and its fucking political  so this all people think about fantasy damn thats sad
  her main character in hundred thousand kingdoms has absolutely no impact on the plot she could have spent the whole time between arriving at the tower and the final ceremony in a coma and the events would have played out exactly the same way on top of that the main character manages to fall in the femalewishfulfillment hole of falling in love with a powerful and dangerous male character in a decision that is exactly the sort of thing that fiction should be telling women to stop doing because its the behaviour that perpetuates the stereotype that women only love jerks women say no and dont mean it and asking for consent isnt sexy    so yeah it was a female fantasy not a feminist fantasy instead everybody should read holly lisle for female characters who are actually people and who do things rather then have things done to them
i thought people disliked racists why is one being celebrated flip the script and have a rising white or asian author act smug about how blacks are jealous of their success while passive aggressively belittling them and theyd be publicly crucified and shamed out the industry
  i thought people disliked racists  they dont though  only racist if its other people
  and sarah maas
  theyre not even trying to hide it anymore the shit is so opened you would have to be lobotomize not to see it
  do you think we will have a literary race war soon
  because you cant be racist against white people five minutes of any diversity credit course in any university in the us will teach you that
  the rocks thing doesnt count you cant eat the rock you can eat those creatures that look like rocks full of gore but those arent rocks     he only rocks people can eat are salt and saccharite but salt can only be eaten in small amounts and saccharite is artificial
  maybe its time you americans do something about those darn universities
  you know people who stand so proudly with the support of the media as they announce how political their fiction is are just never good at writing and weaving it seamlessly into their work
  we must secure the existance of our literature and a future for eurocentrism
  yes everything else reads like absolute dogshit i will not be bored on account of someone elses silly notion of diversity
  dragonlance and forgotten realms novels can be edgy but they are pretty comfy

is incest becoming more and more accepted in fantasy
  i might read it now thx
  book fucking 4    no surprise aphrodite is a complete fucking cunt
  not really i can only really think of one or two series where its relevant to the main plot
ive been trying to find the third book of everybody loves large chests but im not sure if its out yet at least no the ebook version ive checked a few irc servers and none of them show a hit    did anyone find the book or must i wait more its honestly the best series ive read all year
  reverend insanity is by far the best xiaxia ive ever read its not something that jumps out at you but after catching up to it and trying to start reading a few other stories i just cant stand any of them anymore so much quality of life was added to the story with just a few tweaks    mc is a reincarnated 500 year old demonic cultivator succeeds partially based on his knowledge of the future but mostly his ability to see right through bullshit and instantly tell when people are fucking with him  instead of acting like a hotheaded teenager hes actually extremely jaded and cynical and views life as a joke  hes pure fucking evil but doesnt go out of his way to cause trouble he just uses whatever method he thinks will get him what he wants fastest  doesnt even really care if its possible to become immortal just likes the thrill of trying  intentionally backs himself into almost inescapable deadend gambles just to see if he can get out of it  actually gets tricked and/or fucked over several times manages to make it through with meticulous planning and extreme paranoia  other characters are just as devious and scheming as he is  good worldbuilding and exposition in the form of ancient parables and fables  large variety of magical skills challenges and styles  quickly reaching the point where he was before where all his power and experience will be just par for the course  story constantly shits all over the character archetypes of typical protagonists not by just fucking them over for no reason but specifically pointing out their flaws and showing how it leads to their downfall     the thing that bother me the most about the story is the poor wildlife diversity is this planet solely populated by wolves what the fuck do they eat how the fuck are there that many fucking wolves holy shit  but the fact that such a minor problem is my biggest complaint is huge     meanwhile i try to read something else and in the first dozen chapters the guys mindmerged with a 50000 year old ultrapowerful super wizard and become the hulk all by random chance while walking down the street tripping over bullshit getting full of himself and pissing off people far more powerful and influential than himself for no reason only for them to practically slip on fucking banana peels and kill themselves infront of him
  mine own baby slave  has anyone read bot the original and the remake im interested in what its like but i dont feel like reading it again just to find out
  god i hope soi need more momcest
  reading modern fantasy  ohnononono
  incest peaked with heinlein desu
  after giving birth to marie i did not get pregnant again until the spring of 1912 that one was my spoiled brat and favourite child woodrow wilson who was later my lover theodore bronson and much later my husband lazarus long  based heinlein
  how is she so thicc
  ohnononono  do you like peppa pig or some shit  
  the sole redeeming factor of time enough for love is the part where he seduce and fuck his mother its an absolute masterpiece
  no i mean using google with the sites address it used to work but it doesnt anymore i was search daniel black and nothing was showing up
   i was search daniel black  the author actually goes to these sites and ask the posts to be deleted  i downloaded the first books from mobilism and a week later they were gone i dont think its a site problem
  so does that mean that the authors lurk in threads like these and ask the best place to get ebooks so they know where they can go and get a site dcmad  its weird how daniel black and super sales shits are so hard to casually find online
  godspeed anon    theres a remake
  poul anderson was already writing incest back in the 50s  her eyes sought his in the fleeting moonlight i know with a sureness beyond proof that you sail into a trap and i beg you by the milk i gave you as a child and the kisses as a man to stay home this one time
space/scifi horror review 1/5 hull zero three by greg bear    a bit lighter on the horror than i was expecting given the subject matter apart from the terror and tension conveyed in the opening chapters it felt more like an oldschool adventure  brisk pace easy to read motley band of characters trying to get from a to b etc none of this is a bad thing just not quite what i expected     the most enjoyable aspect and definitely the books main strength was the atmosphere and descriptions of travelling through the ship which alone made it a great read was a bit disappointed with the way the plot unraveled in the final quarter of the book  until that point things had been kept simple and tight but the payoff on the major points felt lackluster and suffered from a lot of handwaving by the author i also couldnt shake the feeling that the exciting shit that happened before the start of the story could have been expanded up more in some way seemed a bit of a waste desu    overall 7/10 thoroughly entertaining with great atmosphere let down slightly by a lacklustre plot resolutions    next up revelation space by alistair reynolds
  exactly
  is hull zero three worth reading as a gamer it seems pretty interesting
  didnt the mc impregnate his real sister
  please do not refer to yourself as a gamer
love fantasy  want to write fantasy  have tried for years  always fear that im not writing something substantial enough  always shelve projects that are too ambitious for when im a better writer  want to capture a sense of adventure and journeying to strange new lands and encountering strange new things  but feel its an overdone concept that nobody is interested in  want to write about adventuring parties  but feel like the entire idea of the adventuring party is outdated  always suffer from blank slate protagonist syndrome  who here /sogenresavvythatyousecondguesseverysinglethingyoudobutdontknowhowtotakethatawarenessandcreatesomethinggreatherthanwhatcamebefore/
  amber  belgariad
    picked up based old fantasy
  yes definitely prose and plot are straightforward and the atmosphere is straight out of system shock 2
  dont try to create something greater than what came before anon just create something and work forwards from that no one ever wrote their best story on their first try
  its the broken sword
  always shelve projects that are too ambitious for when im a better writer  youll never become a better writer in the first place if you keep doing this it sounds like you are too attached to your ideas and the concept of being innovative the simple truth is that truly unique story concepts are very rare and that 99 of authors are just giving their own personal permutations on existing tropes which in most cases is more than enough to tell a story which will engage    stop focusing on the intangibles and start focusing on developing the physical craft of writing i recommend short story writing and/or joining a workshop
   feel its an overdone concept that nobody is interested in    not true dont view it as a trope view it as a linchpin of many much loved fantasy works    it doesnt really matter if something is overdone its about doing it well anybody can write a story with some great quest at the centre but to make it a great story you must enrich it with characters and motives and get the reader invested in the journey and ultimately the outcome    this is the challenge you must meet that is the fundamental essence of great fantasy create that adventuring party and let your enthusiasm for it shine through    best of luck
  someone on /int/ or /pol/ has convinced the retards here that its some magical spell that automatically triggers a government shutdown of a chinese users internet permissions
  away you go to the chinese gulag chang
  loves the series  399  wont support the author  ok
how would you guys feel about a story loosely based around the concept of finding carrying protecting and finally destroying the magic object in order to destroy the dark lord only that that magic object somehow found its way into the hands of the scummiest bad guys not affiliated with the dark lord  sorta like lord of the rings only that instead of the one ring being in the hands of frodo its in the hands of some random ass tribe of goblins never affiliated with sauron and instead of destroying it they use it to make sauron their bitch since theyre already evil and ugly as sin and cant fall lower than they themselves becoming the new lowest of the lowest evils in the universe  i kinda fell in love with this idea and thinking about writing it asap god damn it
  your brain on tvtropes
whats /lits/s thoughts on dhalgren
  someone on /int/ or /pol/ has convinced the retards here that its some magical spell that automatically triggers a government shutdown of a chinese users internet permissions  thats an actual thing tough
  absolutely basedbut probably everyone here will hate it because delany is black and gay
  we actually hate it because delaneys a pedophile but those are good reasons too
tfw finally about to start too like the lightning  on the assumption that i actually like the book i hope that palmer finish the last installment soon
  be sure to report back i recently finished it and want to compare notes
  yeahhe is a sick fuck
  delaneys a pedophile  sos marion zimmer bradley but mists of avalon still gets recommended here on occasion
  i liked it but now i hate it because of your pissy comment
  im not a burgerlander sir i cant find a book this new in where i live basically so my only choice is pirating sadly
  a lot of classic authors have turned out to be creeps just off the top of my head    robert a heinlein free love incest pedophilia etc    doc ee smith incest    asimov a serial sexual assaulter would corner women in elevators and grope them iirc    piers anthony pedophile apologist    arthur c clarke iirc alleged to have been a pederast in the 90s but was cleared by the investigation however he was still a famous british man so that pretty much does nothing to clear him    harlan ellison sexually assaulted a woman at a convention got mad when she didnt accept an im sorry you were offended by my actions apology    mzb married a known pedophile walter h breen and helped cover up his actions both of them abused their children from what i recall hearing breen continued to get published because the notables in the sff community of the time dismissed people digging up his convictions for child molestation as being character assassination by haters    the whole sff community up until the 90s seems to have been very furry subculture in its protection of people who really shouldnt have been protected
  thats mostly campbellites they pretty much hijacked sff after wwii and turned it into the congoing clique we know and love today
  this is proof that fantasy  sci fi
  can read 4chan on a computer  cant read kindle on a computer
  mzb  piers  fantasy is better though
  heinlein wrote about how libritarianism would work hes firmly in the fantasy camp
the second baru novel sucked ass i enjoyed the first book a lot even though it was filled with sjw garbage the book at least had some interesting plot    the second book is almost the same minus the interesting plot part wont be reading the third book
whats the consensus in this
    ive read some of harlan ellisons writing about other authors and its very clear that these guys were very close and very defensive of the fact that everything they wrote was in the same filing cabinet editors mistook for a urinal
  dude its on been on irc the moment it was released you are just stupid
so how is mistborn i started reading it and the world seems interesting but i cannot stand vins trust nobody not even yourself monologues every 5 minutes    i am about 150 pages in and it seems to be getting better but i fear when the romance arc comes about it will be insufferable
  which server i checked both irchighway and undernet neither had the third book

    piers anthony  remember reading some of his xanth books in my early teens which had borderline /ss/  google to see if hes written anything more blatant  tfw his latest series is four books of straight up pornography  i wonder if his pedo sympathies made it into that series i wonder if im masochistic enough to find out
is charles strosss the merchant princes series worth reading

  how is amber comfy

  okay its been 3 days lets discuss daniel black book 4
okay so i dont get it why is it that when rorschach decides to destroy theseus it does it by swarming it with scramblers instead of just lightning bolting it out of the sky or redirecting a skimmer or asteroid to smash into it  seems a bit james bond villain tier like haha now mr bond how will you get away from this very slowly moving death machine that gives you plenty of time to escape

  you mean up until the 90s when the poz brigade freakshow arrived and turned the whole thing into an openly communist tumblr circle  patriarchy status s m a s h e d the fact that this is just off the top of your head and the fact that you used that phrase and the fact that you reddit spacing  the story is clear now you are a redditor a roastie and a tool of the jews
so malazan is the greatest fantasy series ever written right
  if by greatest you actually mean bloated piece of trash series with terrible writing and bad characters who dont develop beyond cardboard cutouts even after 10 books then yes its the greatest
  is it wish fulfillment because if it is i might just read it  how is it compared to wheel of time
  10 books  who has the patience to spend that long reading one series seems like the longer series tend to get worse with each book although i never read malazan
are there any fantasy/scifi series that have long academy arcs i enjoy reading those kind of stuff because i dont really get to enjoy mine irl back then
  any kind of entertainment will get worse if it gets very long
  i thought it was quite cleanly written aside from the skippable anthropology lectures and the characters and their chemistry are more believable than any other book ive ever read how can anyone not love tehol and bugg      erikson gets much better as the series goes on why would it be a matter of patience reading 10 books in the same series is no different than reading 10 separate books especially if you enjoy the characters no reason you cant read other books in between if you want a change of scenery either
  reading 10 books in the same series is no different than reading 10 separate books  this is what plebs actually believe
  it got a taste for human flesh and you really dont gain anything by vaporizing theseus besides youd be better off thinking of scramblers as guided biological munitions than crew big r just released a swarm of drones      daniel black  how dare you speak to me you uncouth swine
what are the chances this is going to be good instead of unreadable shit like reamde
tournament mentioned on like page 150 of a 700 page book  doesnt happen until the sequel  i really enjoyed the red knight but the authors such a cocktease
  the tournament doesnt happen in book 2 either
  i liked it but its insanely slow paced like positively glacial
  you cant be fastpaced and have that 12 book series silly anon
  its a trilogy
  based

  thats the eight novel out of fourteen anon not counting the spinoffs you poor sod i get the sunk cost and all that jazz but why waste any more time on it
  because he enjoys reading it
  my guess is stephenson is shooting for that movie/series tier retirement money
  but i liked reamde 
  you done sperged son
what the fuck mods  thread was almost bump limit so we can move on from this shitty thread but you just have to do it

  harry potter
  one of the flowcharts in op says to read the kingkiller chronicles by patrick rothfuss  i would recommend enders game i guess
  but thats childrens book
  already read both and its shit
  harry potter
  cold iron    even if it only lasts one book its still the majority of the book although it isnt so much about the academy as much as it is the city the academy is in
  books centered on school are more likely to be aimed at a younger demographic
    doomtime
  alright thanks
  childrens book  fuck off with this childrens book bullshit harry potter is still a good read as an adult thats what come on  just because its written for children doesnt mean it cant be good
  good post  too bad only the first half of hp is good
  nice digits
  nice digits wasted on shitty post
  harry potter confirmed king of /sffg/
i really liked blindsight   any other scifi that is heavy on the medical stuff
  i dont get the gif
  blood music
  thank you for making a proper voting system that allows multiple choice  sign   rare nonshitposting /pol/ anon
  im bored so im gonna answer this for you in as much detail as i can    inda academy for about half the first book then pirate adventures  dawn of wonder think it was the whole first book theres an excursion but iirc its part of the academy  blood song like 60 of the book sequels suffer from shift to multiple pov  magicians guild trudi canavan about 2 books worth over the trilogy other povs outside of it but theyre also members of the school  red sister its kind of a school i think about 75 of the two books so far takes place there  the emperors blades entirety of first book for one character  talion revenant about half the book  shamans crossing most of the book the plot really kicks into gear in book 2 didnt like this and i love robin hobb  mercedes lackey has like 30 different books set in and around magical schools  nevernight magic assassin school its basically just the dark brotherhood from elder scrolls but as a school   imager original trilogy all set in and around a magic school really good  recluce same author as imager theres like 30 books set in the world and some of them are in magic schools learning is a theme in all  the high ground scifi i cant remember much of this one but iirc the whole first book is space cadet school stuff
so is this shit any good or just overhyped boomer scifi
  its shit jack
  just because its written for children doesnt mean it cant be good  agreed  harry potter is still a good read as an adult  lets not get ahead of ourselves though
  its great
  its fine  waste less of your time than some recent fantasy doorstop
  pleaseim begging you read another book
why did my post have to be a get    the first few books at least had something to them i mean they made the series into very well recieved movies like  man you guys suck    i have
  great ideas shit prose worst dialogue known to man
  read legends of galactic heroes its like foundation but good
  an upvote for you good sir
  i have    i mean besides twilight
  nice try weeb
  it was a book series before it was an anime
  logh is good sf and no amount of weeaboophobia will change that
fuck i have so many ideas i want to make stories of and so little desire to write
codex alera y/n
  fuck no its even worse than dresden
  well thats disappointing
  because you dont associate writing with creativity you associate it with work youre content to fantasize and dont need to actually create anything to feel your ideas fulfilled you are in short an ideaguy
  are you trying to say writing is not work
    dont listen to this anon ive gone through this phase too it will pass usually i seem to feel better after i find a way to present work or something although im not sure if thats the best drive or not   regardless it will pass if you keep writing it stops seeming like a chore eventually    thats not to say its not work but it wont so much be a chore any more least not for the most part
any books on ai mind prison im terrified of idea of worse things than death that fictional ai could push upon the human mind
  if you do something you enjoy it isnt work anon
tell me about the chiang pill is this thing as good as its hyped up to be
  i mean its really fucking good
  its ok the chinks got alright ideas but his characters are pretty much nonexistent
  how is this btw  i like the premise but i have never read anything by the author
  its stunning ornate prose that doesnt stand in the way of the flow extremely simple story that still carries themes of the nature of wonder and when the magics gone frustrating but only so much that the finales more satisfying for it
so if this was 8/10 for me how much would i enjoy 2 and 3 books
  got alright ideas but his characters are pretty much nonexistent  thats every sci fi ever
  also my rating for fantasy reads this year  emperors blade  8/10  ship of magic  8/10  way of kings  7/10  the republic of thieves  6/10  to green angel tower  9/10  the heart of what was lost  7/10  best served cold  8/10  the heroes  8/10  red country  7/10   beyond redemption  8/10  the sad tale of the brothers grossbart  7/10  city of stairs  6/10  children of earth and sky  8/10
  wheres masters of rome
  guess how i spotted the guy who didnt read the good ones
  that applies even to the good ones maybe even especially so
  somewhere else
  shadow of the torturer
  ah yes the average teenager who only uses the 610 part of the scale where 7 means average and 6 means worst book of all time
  nah its just all this book are way above average
  if anything belows 6 gets published somebody needs getting hanged
  this always happens when you rate by a scale higher than five
  sanderson and sanderson clones  nah its more or less all the average mass produced drivel meant to appeal to as many people as possible    by definition the majority of books are 5 low iq anon
  if everything you read you found to be above average then youll get a lot of 6/10 and 7/10 scores youre enjoyment of a book doesnt go down to a 5/10 simply because of the other books you read that year
  andromeda strain
  chiang is probably the best sffg short story writer alive right now
  you just need an urgent task that needs doing so that writing becomes a therapeutic procrastination method  i still havent started my masters thesis i just spent half a day writing a vance inspired short story though
  if everything you read you found to be above average   thats not how it works if everything is above average then nothing is you cant have more above average books than average ones the more books you read the closer your average rating goes to 50
  then youll never make it but thats good i dont need any more competition
  that doesnt make sense because then that changes the criteria for enjoyment that you rated those books if 5/10 meant you thought it was okay and lets say 7/10 meant you thought it was firmly good and you read ten 7/10 novels that doesnt mean those novels become 5/10 novels because that was all the sample size you read
  ill give you that hairy potter is good but its not great there are better ya fantasy books and series than hairy potter

  logh is good sf  it really really wasnt dweeb
  waaah why didnt they explain warp drives why didnt they have threedimensional tactics mummy make him stop saying it was good
  i assume it gets better i tried watching the first episode and it felt like it was designed for absolute retards  master tactician  just run at them lol  enemy unable to comprehend the just run at them lol attack  1000 vs 800 results in 0 wrecks vs 800 wrecks three times in a row  not to mention the dialogue was trash and it looked like trash the webms posted definitely look better so i asume they picked up their slack with the actual animation
  you overly defensive guys are the worst dont join a critique group if you cant take criticism just keep writing shit and ignore good criticism and dont learn anything lol
  first episode  he didnt start with the pilot film  yikes
  whoops
looks like the cover copy what some call the blurb for a little hatred is now out there    the chimneys of industry rise over adua and the world seethes with new opportunities but old scores run deep as ever    on the bloodsoaked borders of angland leo dan brock struggles to win fame on the battlefield and defeat the marauding armies of stour nightfall he hopes for help from the crown but king jezals son the feckless prince orso is a man who specialises in disappointments    savine dan glokta  socialite investor and daughter of the most feared man in the union  plans to claw her way to the top of the slagheap of society by any means necessary but the slums boil over with a rage that all the money in the world cannot control    the age of the machine dawns but the age of magic refuses to die with the help of the mad hillwoman iserniphail rikke struggles to control the blessing or the curse of the long eye glimpsing the future is one thing but with the guiding hand of the first of the magi still pulling the strings changing it will be quite another
  i should probably get around reading the second trilogy
see the sad thing about a guy like you is in about 50 years youre gonna start doing some thinking on your own and youre gonna come up with the fact that there are two certainties in life one dont do that and two you dropped a hundred and fifty grand on a fuckin education you coulda got for a dollar fifty in late charges at the public library    was he right
depends on the degree
in terms of the education yes theres no doubt that if you spent 4 years in a library studying a field that you would be much more knowledgeable than what you learn in your classes    but that doesnt get you a degree and thats kind of important
  its rare to have the discipline to be an autodidact in this way
  most public libraries in the us have terrible book collections youre not going to learn much there
start with the greeks
   not starting with sumerian/assyrian texts    yikes
  was he right  well my boys wicked smaht
you want real american history read hoard zinn  i am supposed to believe this matt damon character is a genius    this movie is liberal propoganda  muh poor abused janitor is a genius because he goes to the library  real life doesnt happen this way kiddo
  put your trip back on deepedgy
  sumerian and assyrians provided nothing of worth and what little worth could be derived from them was summarized by the greeks so yea start with the greeks
  this the only real life example of this is ray bradbury if anything its gonna be more common because of the internet
  this very hard to take the claims of genius seriously when he cites zinn instead of some shit like william appleman williams or gabriel kolko also he totally mischaracterized gordon woods positions trash history that appears smart to leftist pseudointellectuals
implying the purpose of university is knowledge rather than networking and other social advancement
  what are the good history books
  a hundred and fifty grand  people were charged 50k annually for a harvard history degree in the 90s
  /pol/ showing its true power level becuase it cant take a simple feelgood movie at face value and has to project their fear of liberals onto every piece of media it consumes
  hes addressing the question that was asked
  if will didnt have miracle autism he would live and die as the school janitor while the guy might make a comfortable living on the image that expensive piece of paper has
  there are no singular good books on history so its best to read works within certain topics and specialties so for example for american foreign policy read william appleman williams the tragedy of american diplomacy for the rise of corporations read the triumph of conservatism by gabriel kolko and the corporate reconstruction of american capitalism by sklar for labor history read stuff by david montgomery and braverman etc zinn is a very shallow thinker who does almost no primary archival research of his own and merely cobbles together black and white narratives of oppressor and oppressed that rely heavily on the work of other better scholars i guess as a leftist survey history of america its decent but then most survey works in general are garbage zinns a historian but hes not a historian even as a leftist historian hes midtier at best
  yeah but at least i wont be unoriginal     damons character was pretty unoriginal in the movie 2bh
  orange man bad
  everyone mad at will wasting his potential   everyone ok at the end when he leaves it all to chase after an unremarkable broad
  i got the impression everyone was sick of his shit and werent too sad to have him out of their lives at least when it comes to the university people
  case in point
least i wont be wearing tatty shirts
  i can confirm this as i am a leftist pseudo intellectual who likes this movie
  at least post the video you fucking brainlet     
do you feel like youre alone will do you have a soul mate  i got plenty shakespeare neetche freud frost oconnor kant pope locke and the list goes on
  what
  not him but   no degreeno jobpoor quality of life

  this might blow your mind but you go to the university to get the certificate that says you completed a program there and to build a network of contacts you can use to get a job spend a couple years working a job and not being in the high school  undergrad  grad school world work with people who dont have college degrees and then go back into the system and you will have a totally different mindset like looking at an alien world
this scene is disgusting no one would act like this  if someone ever tried talking about their theories of early colonist markets you could just say the phrase what and call him a pussy and you would come off about 30x times better than he does
  go to the university in order to build a network in order to get a job in order to make money in order to buy a house in order to sit at the computer in order to browse four channel in order to pass the time in order to get to tomorrow in order to get to the end of the month in order to get to retirement in order to   when will it all end anon

  a boat docked in a tiny mexican village    an american tourist complimented the mexican fisherman on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took him to catch them    not very long answered the mexican    but then why didnt you stay out longer and catch more asked the american    the mexican explained that his small catch was sufficient to meet his needs and those of his family    the american asked but what do you do with all your time    i sleep late fish a little play with my children and take a siesta with my wife in the evenings i go into the village to see my friends have a few drinks play the guitar and sing a few songsi have a full life    the american interrupted i have an mba from harvard and i can help you    you should start by fishing longer every day you can then sell the extra fish you catch with the extra revenue you can buy a bigger boat with the extra money the larger boat will bring you can buy a second one and a third one and so on until you have an entire fleet of trawlers    instead of selling your fish to a middle man you can negotiate directly with the processing plants and maybe even open your own plant    you can then leave this little village and move to mexico city los angeles or even new york city from there you can direct your huge enterprise    how long would that take asked the mexican    twenty perhaps twentyfive years replied the american    and after that    afterwards thats when it gets really interesting answered the american laughing when your business gets really big you can start selling stock and make millions    millions really and after that    after that  and this is the best part  youll be able to retire live in a tiny village near the coast sleep late catch a few fish take a siesta and spend your evenings drinking and enjoying your friends

  samefag again sorry did not mean to spoiler anybody how does this censoring work here
  impregante woman in order to have children in order to impregnat woman in order to have children in order to impregnate woman in order to have children in order to perish in some calamity  its all rather disgusting isnt it
  and yet it would all come to the same periodic absurdity
  but cunny tho
  higher education isnt a place to become educated its a place to get a piece of paper that tells an employer that you managed to as an adult stick with something for 4 years until it was done and get some knowledge that may be vaguely related to what they want you to do
  i disagree while in theory its possible to read all those stuff class is absolutely necessary to get you interested and inspired you need to see that other people care about the subject so you would like to work on it     and i think face to face classroom situation is still more motivating than online community despite all its shortcoming such as interpersonal conflicts conflicts in studies traffic problem etc     the matt damon guy can do this on his own because he is supposed to be driven by a passion that his friends dont care about
  get the piece of paper to get the job to get that salary to get that apartment to impregnate that girl to have those kids to pay their medical bills to make sure they reproduce when theyre older to make sure that the species keeps on plowing towards their ultimate doom  but what is it all for anon to breed like maggots and perish for nothing
  no one said that any of that is necessary at all and the only part that i implied was  get the piece of paper to get the job to get that salary  what you choose to spend your energy and money on is your own decision but having a child or two isnt breeding like maggots those with a degree typically have less children not more  having a degree and a good salary gives you more choices not less you might complain about having to work but you could simply quit and still be better off than you were before assuming you paid off your student debt  i would make the assumption about anyone that enrolls in a university that they are not actually as interested in expanding their knowledge as they are in fulfilling some requirement for better employment
  it was a different time it was the 90s
  ideally youre studying in the company of like minds under the direction of someone who knows more than you    its a natural formula for a better learning experience than just reading a book its an option to teach yourself technically but its less likely to work and very likely to be a slower and shallower process if it does    also university tuition is paying for a general body of learning resources as opposed to just reading lists and verbal reviews
  dont worry all good sociopaths like you know this and act on this instinctively
  youre wrong the proper use of the university is to learn the contemptus mundi in order to bring a dignified end to this whole incestuous charade
  perhaps if university taught such a thing you would be right but it does not
  true the whole process the degree is to proof to companies that you actually know the subject in matter because you studied it and passed the tests with acceptable marks that prove so  today that is the main diference of education from universities and selftaught
  no good will hunting is a stupid persons fantasy version of a smart person notice that he never actually says or does anything truly intelligent he just recites wikipedia articles and smugly bathes in the awe and envy of everybody around him    also notice that matt damon is a harvard graduate who never would have been able to make such a shitty movie and so many millions of dollars had he not been rubbing shoulders with the hollywood producers and academics that harvard gave him access to    pic related its good will hunting
  poorfags live like this define every move and decision based on getting a job must be hard
  no most poorfags dont think ahead at all
  is matt damon the dfw of hollywood
  you are right the thing is you can accomplish both just be at the university but never go to the actual lectures and use your sparetime to red in the library so you will pass your tests best of both worlds famalam
  i guess you have never studied and/or hung out at student bars
  case in point  criiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinge
  convincd that half this thread his him now that you mention it
  criiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinge  ironic faggotry is still faggotry anon  inb4 yikes jeez omg etc
  wowzers
  everything that i dont like is /pol/  brainlet
  this is all im learning in college right now haha
  think about your own passions and desires now realize that seeing that other people being interested in the same material shouldnt be a main driving force i believe that classes are important but not because i have to sit with 20 other retards for an hour and fifteen minute i want to ask a professor questions which the reading may not of been clear on i want to use the supplies and resources of the university i dont want to feel that my own decisions are validated because others also made the same decisions
tfw you lurk around the local elite liberal arts college stealing their rare and out of date library books then using their student art studio to rebind the books with expensive cloth all while pretending to be a student    its kind of a winwin
  cringe
  hows fatherhood sounds like youre just hanging in there
  lmao ill never have shitty kids you dumb nigger youre still cringe though
  this    the degree is important because its a stamp not everyone is going to have the ability to self motivate and go to a library but these days you dont even have to everything is online everything
  it depends on the subject really
  student bars are filled with people talking about sport while skipping their lectures
  it says on your resume that you spent the last four years studying at the local library  unfortunately were only considering candidates with a bachelors degree at this time  how the fuck did you even get an interview the automated hr shouldve filtered you out filthy plebian  have fun pushing carts at krogers you dumb nigger    also who tf pays 150k on a degree
its pretty depressing how much schooling you need for even just average office drone job that even a hs dropout could do is university just not like how it used to be or something is this just part of some scheme
  universities want lots of students so they can make more money high schools look better if they send more kids to college and parents want the prestige of their children being welleducated thus there is a universal propaganda that everyone should go to college but the more people that graduate college the less value a college degree and high school diploma holds so the credentials required for even lowlevel jobs are continually increasing as the credentials have a decreasing value
  university originated in an age where the majority of people were serfs or other forms of peasants tied to the land held by a lord literacy was extremely limited and the intellectual elite was generally clergy and related learning latin and philosophical traditions as well as stuff like law and medicine
  he doesnt do anything intelligent  he solves those two formulas and the work he does with dr lambeau demonstrates his intelligence the wikipedia quoting is just banter to fuck with nerds and get laid plus its not like hes some magical genius like youre claiming its stated he has an eidetic memory
  only that is wrong by that reasoning if someone summarised the greeks successfully today you could just read contemporary lit inspired him    fucktard
  if everyone has something it holds no value in the market the same amount of shit jobs still exist everyone having a degree doesnt mean those jobs dont need doing anymore
  gee golly
  yes only one year into my degree and this seems to be all im getting out of it so far still i have a little hope i can find a better path
  class is absolutely necessary to get you interested and inspired  if youre a brainlet who is doing it basically for social reasons
  university exposes students to different modes of thinking whether they like it or not most people stick to their little intellectual corners and this would remain true of the material one would borrow from the library this guy wouldnt get the same thing from personal research unless he voluntarity broke his bubble and read shit he doesnt agree with
  brainlets seriously need to pay thousands of dollars a year and attend a four year racket so an old tenured hasbeen can force them to read outside their echo chamber holy shit lmao  and are you seriously acting like university exposes to a whole wide range of thought most degrees narrow you down to an autistic level by your second year and the ones that dont include some but exclude so many others it makes no difference i can just walk an extra three feet in the library to get the same effect im so fucking happy my parents are rich and i dont have to rely on my phil degree to not be poor
   this has been partly my experience     visit philosophy section  1000 copies of everything john dewey ever wrote   1 copy each of evola kierkegaard pierce tilich mencken sometimes not even that many     hmmmmmmm
reminder that dfw basically fapped over this scene
  i think the point is to get your degree so you can get your sinecure that allows you to work an intellectual job producing little of actual use and so you dont have to have a working class job where everyone treats you like shit because you have a working class job
  who
  grad school
  around that yeah but lets face it harvard has deep pockets and if youre someone valuable theyre just going to pay for you or at least that was the case until college started reverting back to the privilege of the small elite because of its inflationary costs     even then harvard could afford to pay full boat scholarships for all of its students and hand them a 3000 check when they graduate too if they wanted
  or someone in your family could have bequeathed the university an endowment generations ago free ride
  sinecure     but that doesnt exist anymore especially not in academia perpetual fellows and dons are a 19th century fantasy    i get what you mean though im a librarian and even though it doesnt pay that much atm i get to be called a knowledge worker whereas everyone in my family treats being a plumber as a meh job even though youd certainly make way more than me once you became a master
  mind you that school does not always provide all the skill your employers are look for when hiring
  this ive been to a decent number of libraries up and down the east coast at the very least and it seems like philosophy and history sections have been thoroughly weeded the former is largely nonexistent were not like france where a certain amount of philosophy is mandatory in school and the latter has been replaced with a lot of pophistory
  my parents are boring southern businesspeople with no trace of a liberal arts education or any expressed interest in art literature etc if it werent for four years of being surrounded by smart driven people in an intense environment i never would have actually gotten into lit  selfeducation seems much more possible to the educated in retrospect but if youre actually in an uneducated environment its difficult to even know where to begin much less have the drive to sustain the work ethic required for it i at least am grateful i had teachers and classmates shoving stuff down my throat otherwise i doubt i ever would have discovered anything myself    t columbia french lit major
  amazing
  law students
  hero    kill yourself    you too though
  noone gives a fuck about your downvote faggot
    hes right its just that the degree is too important   its like that autist whos actually very capable and smart but dresses horribly going to a job interview and getting angry at the less capable but well dressed guy getting the job  too bad  image is the only thing that matters
  hitlers war
  he kinda looks like the golden one
    wrong
    there are plenty more examples institutionalised and group learning however is still more effective and productive it was designed that way by our prussian overlords after all
his prattle on omens and universe conspiracies is honestly just stupid but he does get one thing right people are too concerned with keeping appearances to really do what is important in life thats the same message you will find in any great philosopher     his prose is shit and its too blatant nice message though     just trying to figure out what makes it so successful i remember thinking that i could easily have written something better
  anyone can write better than that hack
  why is he so successful then
want to write atmospheric and environmental things involving mundane work with ones hands and travelling but i cant accurately describe anything except certain kinds of deserts because ive not lived or explored anywhere that would give me a true experience to draw from its not like fantasy wherein you can just gloss over it i want to write interactions and observations that relate to the environment    what book would educate me on the types of trees geological formations weather and so on also i dont really know what snow is like either
experience those things and write when you get older
leeks are so yum
fuck you dad  why do women do this   books for this feel
  male vegans are shit too
god bongs are subhuman i hope someone nukes perfidious albion
off topic question   books for this feel  hehe now mods cant delete it
is there any book that captures the essence of the phrase ignorance is bliss like some book where the protagonist really doesnt criticize themselves for their actions    im fed up with always judging myself for everything i do and i envy those people who go about in their lives not really stopping to think about their actions
recently been reading angry white pajamas and would like other suggestions im a karateka i know the books about aikido so something more along those lines would be appreciated
i wish there were more detailed books on martial arts but 90 of them are introductory history or nonsense it may be nice to find a technical karate manual that goes in depth but theres also a bit of a keeping information inhouse attitude
goodnight frens

  a personal matter by kenzaburo oe has been my favorite so far
should i learn half a dozen languages just to read literature is it worth it i feel like i cant possibly get the real experience just through some translation of the original
do you have anything better to be doing probably not
  this
  tfw born a spanish speaker  know english like the rest of the world  learn latin and greek at school  80 mutuall intellegibility with portuguese and italian  learn french for pleasure  learn german as a hobby  how can monolingualfags even compete
  but have you learnt moon yet
  just trust the competence of the translators its always worth it to learn new languages but i wouldnt postpone good reading for it
if you live in new york you probably already speak three that said most people do learn more than their native language so as to absorb higher art in its desired form
half a dozen  only english french latin italian and russian are worth knowing  you seem to know english now you only need four more
  he only knows european languages
  know english like the rest of the world  wait do esls actually think that what they know amounts to english
  i speak spanish and international english  very impressive indeed
  japanese is pretty difficult to learn but its incredibly beautiful lovely language
  its incredibly beautiful lovely language  its literally the harshest worst sounding east asian language delusional animetard
  he doesnt know  most esls have larger vocabulary than average native speaker brainlet
  theres nothing to read in it inb4 you dun no cuz translation
  if youre an english native speaker you should at the very least learn french
  most esls have larger vocabulary than average native speaker  most esls cant get through two or three sentences without massive grammatical failure  regardless vocabulary is the easiest thing in the world to acquire im talking grammar and idiom intuition both of which your post is lacking
  what about german and greek
  lol no
  i dont follow anime or that other shit i studied classical japanese literature      im esl and i have trouble with 19th century texts or older there are so many words i have to look up
  most esls cant get through two or three sentences without massive grammatical failure  yeah they can otherwise they wouldnt be true esls but mere wannabes or students
  im esl and i have trouble with 19th century texts or older there are so many words i have to look up  so do burgerfats they whine about it they cant go beyond 19th century lit without feeling in an alien territory
  regardless vocabulary is the easiest thing in the world to acquire  theres not much more to english your orc tongue is literally just a giant mess of borrowed terms with shitty irregular orthographic loosely coupled together with stupefyingly simple degenerated grammar idiom intuition is little more than memorization of use cases  both of which your post is lacking  cute how seething makes you this irrational
  im esl and i have trouble with 19th century  so do most natives
  im esl and the big writers are just insoluble to me
  german literature is very pretty weak stuff outside of a few philosophical works most of which can be read as well in translation the same is true of greek a lot of idiots will whine about this post but mastering greek is an immensely wasteful enterprise unless you have a special interest in hellenic studies theres only one iliad and only one odyssey much of the rest is going to be stuff like the bacchae     lit without feeling in an alien territory  poor english    theres not much more to english  you mean not much more that your capable of perceiving   cute how seething makes you this irrational  you write poor english sorry if that upsets you
  and you think the average burgerfat can perfectly read gravitys rainbow and ulysses lol dr seuss and harry potter is their peak
  thats the kind of rhetoric to be expected from a dilettante unwilling to make any effort if reading german means you can read kant goethe heidegger and mann in their unfiltered tongue then its well worth it
the only language you lot seem to know is how to suck each others dicks    why is this board filled with beta cringelords
  poor english  lets see your italian french latin greek spanish german portuguese or russian mr nabokov surprise us
  you mean not much more that your capable of perceiving  i mean just what i said sorry if such a simple truth about your language upsets you  you write poor english  kek no comment
  you write poor english  not much more that your capable of perceiving
  very pretty weak  your  you write poor english  its an esl tries to larp as a native speaker episode
  german literature is very pretty weak stuff outside of a few philosophical works most of which can be read as well in translation the same is true of greek a lot of idiots will whine about this post but mastering greek is an immensely wasteful enterprise unless you have a special interest in hellenic studies theres only one iliad and only one odyssey much of the rest is going to be stuff like the bacchae     how can you not see the lack of selfawareness here what constitutes the canon the classics and works of merit is entirely shaped by which linguistic culture youre from do you really think that the reason you are well aware of a considerably larger amount of good english literature than any other lang is not due to the fact that you were born raised and currently socialized in a predominantly englishspeaking community to know a language is to know a world if you could speak german greek or spanish you would be well aware of a much larger sphere of great literature in those languages than you would otherwise
  chinese sounds like mumblecore with all those unrolled rs
  you have shit taste or youre chinese
    seething porn cartoon connoisseurs  phonetically japanese is horrible deal with it
  thats the kind of rhetoric to be expected from a dilettante unwilling to make any effort  this is the kind of rhetoric to be expected from a dilettante who doesnt know what true effort is and thinks it means reaching a conversational level true effort is time consuming and needs to be economized  goethe and mann are bad writers and philistines kant and heidegger can be read in other languages   lets see your italian french latin greek spanish german portuguese or russian mr nabokov surprise us  nabokov never spoke italian latin greek spanish or more than a small smattering of german  why youve added portugese i cant imagine    kek no comment  calm down      typo cope
  yep youre an angry chinese ching chong
  how can you not see the lack of selfawareness here what constitutes the canon the classics and works of merit is entirely shaped by which linguistic culture youre from  and nearly all of the contributions of greek can be had in translation there is only a motive of personal enjoyment for learning old greek there are beautiful works in that language for most it is not worth the effort however   do you really think that the reason you are well aware of a considerably larger amount of good english literature than any other lang is not due to the fact that you were born raised and currently socialized in a predominantly englishspeaking community  i listed 4 languages besides english with great literature
  the fundamentals can be somewhat hard to acquire at first for an english native since theyre quite different but one you get past that most of it is easy and it gets considerably easier the more you know i think time in the language is much more of a factor than sheer difficulty once you have a solid understanding of the fundamentals the only really difficult parts are a handful of niche nuances in grammar and tones if you actually care about how you sound      i dont see that at all i would say taiwanese but its just personal preference at the end of the day
  nabokov never spoke italian latin greek spanish or more than a small smattering of german  i never said he did i was mocking your english ironically calling you nabokov but dont change the topic show us your knowledge of other languages or gtfo
  goethe and mann are bad writers and philistines  kant and heidegger can be read in other languages
  i never said he did i was mocking your english ironically calling you nabokov  point out successfully something wrong with my english and ill oblige you
  both german and spanish have much more substantial corpora of significant literary works than italian your whole reply chain is one giant cringeinducing performance of a retarded pseud please stop spreading misinformation and fud
  but one you get past that most of it is easy  what how about memorizing 15000 unique characters with several different pronunciations and the different registers are incredibly tough to get used to in everyday conversation
  you mean not much more that your capable of perceiving  here you used your instead of youre rookie mistake but since you have an absolute control of the english tongue and nabokov tier prose this shouldnt have happened
  goethe and mann are bad writers and philistines
  i said something wrong with my english itself not mere typos on a message board this is pretty weak stuff by that logic there isnt a person in history with good prose
  both german and spanish have much more substantial corpora of significant literary works than italian your whole reply chain is one giant cringeinducing performance of a retarded pseud please stop spreading misinformation and fud  if you state it emphatically it must be true      poshlust philistines
  mmy mistakes are just typos
  oh no no no those are just typos  after sperging at perfectly correct posts for being poor english
  it is objectively true to claim otherwise would be insane and you know it hence the glib pseud remark  poshlust  its poshlost retarded rsl
  theres nothing wrong with my english neither and your is more than a mere typo its a mental fart
do people actually believe in learning greek/latin as some kind of gateway to forbidden knowledge
    too incompetent to judge actual prose style  ill just pretend that everyone doesnt make typos from carelessness  i mean if online victories mean so much to you you have this one id still be interested to see whether or not you have a working conception of style though if typos are indicative of poor writing then surely you have better writing than mine write me a few sentences describing an abandoned building or a forest or something
itt
  the exorcism mass is in latin though
  theres nothing wrong with my english neither  either  and your is more than a mere typo its a mental fart  its mere carelessness a small thing to me but it seems to mean the world to you
  not until you show us your knowledge of a second language mr nabokov its easy to throw shit at esls but lets see how you use another tongue i pointed out your mistake now its your turn
  what how about memorizing 15000 unique characters with several different pronunciations  firstly i assume you meant 1500 but even then if youre alluding to the 常用漢字 its like 2100 or so either way again thats not so much difficult as it is just timeconsuming unless youre actually mentally challenged you can make your brain remember them if you put in the time its not like certain parts of grammar that are hard to wrap your head around theyre just symbols you have to memorize and as far as the pronunciations go the vast majority of them have the same kun yomi and on yomi some of them only have one knowing the ones that have a unique kun yomi or on yomi is again simply a matter of remembering     and the different registers are incredibly tough to get used to in everyday conversation    at first sure but at least for me it doesnt take that much input to get accustomed to a lot of the familiarity happens unconsciously anyways all you really have to do is just consume enough content and it eventually becomes second nature
  poshlust  kek and lmoa
  i pointed out your mistake  no you hid and continue to hide behind a typo if a typo were proof enough of bad english then you would be able to call elliot and nabokov poor writers you need something substantial before youll get anything out of me
  muh style  very pretty weak  write poor english  nigger not only do you lack any sense of style you fail to preserve basic lexical cohesion sometimes those angry little pseud tirades spiced up with thesaurus autoreplacements arent nearly as impressive as youre imagining
  i assume you meant 1500  my bad i included those needed for classical literature you still need way more than the jouyou kanji for competence
  ii cant write in another language hehe that wasnt a mistake it was a typo every great writer has them xd   pusillanimous as expected have a nice day mr nabokov
  very pretty weak  write poor english  the first is an obvious typo and there is nothing wrong with the second  nigger not only do you lack any sense of style you fail to preserve basic lexical cohesion sometimes  on the basis of more typos    those angry little pseud tirades spiced up with thesaurus autoreplacements  i havent used a single uncommon or especially literary word this says a lot about what you consider to be difficult words   arent nearly as impressive as youre imagining  now youre making me think you were impressed with my english which i purposely try to keep as clear and simple as possible
why is it just me or is being born monolingual at mandarin a barrier against nearly all other language learnings this tongue works anyway but grammatically
  the first is an obvious typo  ive never seen this much grasping at straws in my entire life
  i havent used a single uncommon or especially literary word this says a lot about what you consider to be difficult words  he cant even comprehend an insult thrown at him    muh english is so fucking superior esls  now youre making me think you were impressed with my english
  whatever helps you sleep at night faggot
  pusillanimous as expected have a nice day mr nabokov  what was even the point of all this you could have discussed the merits of those languages but instead you hid behind shallow criticisms and then got scared and ran off as soon as i demanded something more substantial im willing to show you my french as well as my latin just as soon as youve demonstrated whats wrong with my english style
  muh english is so fucking superior esls   youre making me think you were impressed with my english  all i said was i keep my english simple the fact that you think of it as thesaurus english says that you were somewhat impressed with the vocabulary which frankly pretty pathetic    only an esl wouldnt recognize it as such     cope
  instead you hid behind shallow criticisms  you barged into thread foaming about everyones english being poor and repeating it over and over without any substantiation whatsoever mocking and deriding your turgid stupidity and complete lack of selfawareness is basically a thing of honor plus the whole delusional anglo angle is just hilarious
  still cant comprehend what thesaurus comment meant  very poor style my good chap
  my bad i included those needed for classical literature  not to say the number is wrong but that does seem like it would be a bit off to me where exactly did you get that number    you still need way more than the jouyou kanji for competence  that depends on where youre applying competence to in everyday life as the name suggests the 常用漢字 are are suggested for everyday situations but in all honesty you can successfully communicate in japanese with less ive been told by japanese people that they on average know roughly 3500 or so and academics know somewhere around 5000 but ive also seen some say its higher theres no real concrete answer as far as ive seen
  youre the one with the shallow criticisms poor english and then immediately typed your instead of youre pathetic after you got all salty about the fact i was an esl and said what i knew amounted to nothing i demanded your knowledge of your sl which you failed to present and then after i pointed out your stupid mistake you hid in the fact it was a mere typo and that all the greats have them    cope harder monolingualfag
  you barged into thread foaming about everyones english being poor and repeating it over and over without any substantiation whatsoever  besides your grammatical errors  mocking and deriding your turgid stupidity  turgid isnt the right word  and complete lack of selfawareness is basically a thing of honor  this is an imageboard where people post japanese cartoon titties   plus the whole delusional anglo angle is just hilarious  then why do you sound so serious/upset    i know what it was supposed to mean im much more interested in what you didnt want it to mean you thought thesaurus as soon as you saw my simply written posts because very basic english seems elevated to you
  where exactly did you get that number  university i studied japanese literature there my kanji dictionary has pretty much that amount  either way the multiple pronunciations are tough as hell maybe because i studied chinese too and sometimes the symbols overlapped but it was utter chaos in my mind
  i know what it was supposed to mean  but im going to deliberately interpret it differently to help me cope with being dabbed on by esls  what was the phrase ah yes cope harder faggot
  youre the one with the shallow criticisms poor english and then immediately typed your instead of youre pathetic  hiding behind typos like a teen girl on facebook  after you got all salty about the fact i was an esl and said what i knew amounted to nothing i demanded your knowledge of your sl which you failed to present and then after i pointed out your stupid mistake you hid in the fact it was a mere typo and that all the greats have them  cope harder monolingualfag  i can furnish proof of my knowledge just write three good sentences describing a tree or a house or anything and then we can start conversing in french or latin
  besides your grammatical errors  those are all typos of course  turgid isnt the right word  it is  this is an imageboard where people post japanese cartoon titties   yet you still manage to be completely unaware of yourself  then why do you sound so serious/upset  guess you hear whatever helps you cope
unironically attempting to save face on an anonymous cantonese basket weaving bulletin board system
  those are all typos of course  clearly not  it is  prove it then  yet you still manage to be completely unaware of yourself  says the guy fighting for honor on a jap titties website  guess you hear whatever helps you cope  projection    give me three good english sentences or gtfo
  how did / do you go about learning kanji but i can understand the tightened degree of difficulty if the pronunciations are conflicting with the chinese pronunciations especially if you were learning them at the same time idk it may just be a personality difference at the end of the day
  clearly not  clearly they are  prove it then  you made the claim you prove it illiterati  says the guy fighting for honor  im just here to enjoy your impotent seething and desperate wiling away  projection  nno you11    give me three good russian sentences or gtfo
i stay monolingual because im a wagecuck brainlet and know ill never get to anything past small talk level
  how do you know you dont have to be some high iq anglo to learn a foreign language and if youre native language is english there are plenty of languages you could get past small talk level in no time
  you gotta learn the radicals bro im a different anon but i learned my first 1000 kanji sort of brute forcing it then i switched to chinese where you need to know a lot more 5000 is collegelevel literacy 10000 is professor level start by learning the 275 or so radicals then its way easier to piece characters together as you learn them once you learn around 5k characters then its just easy to pick up more and it becomes hard to calculate how many you actually know
  give me three good russian sentences or gtfo  never claimed to speak russian you claim to speak good english give me three good sentences or run away
  ive given plenty bubbah its unhealthy to seethe this long

  i think you generally shouldnt tell people how you really feel    but i can see how the other part could be situational
while its good to have friends remember that you and you alone are responsible for your own wellbeing    wallowing in selfpity and blaming others for you problems is the most pathetic existence there is     god may love you but the world does not     youre not important so relax a little     even family and trusted friends are capable of betrayal
wow anonymous you give some really good advice i bet youre doing great in life right now
when did you realize that until you actually experience as much of emotional reality as possible youll never be able to write believable characters or relationships that no amount of imagination and pondering in your room will let you understand the depth of the human experiences youve denied yourself
  ive only been in love once and im terrified that ill never figure out what different kinds of love actually feel like and any story created from something outside myself will come across as disingenuous some two dimensional concept that anyone with actual experience in the matter would see through with distaste
  is that why a lot of anime/manga feels emotionally stunted
  likewise those people that are intent on experiencing everything will ironically never experience what its like to set boundaries for yourself
  you dont have to write that far beyond what you know and you only need to know enough for it to be stimulating
ha when i dream i totally loose the sense of my ego and can be nearly any person  checkmate pleb
    experience is irrelevant to knowing
  couldnt you just set up those boundaries once youre satisfied and wouldnt you be better informed as to where they should be     also thinking of the need to experience everything is a little artistically unfair a writer of experience is a little like a nervous swimmer you only skim the water but you feel the currents beneath you its not about mapping an ocean
theyre gonna judge you no matter what you do my guy
  yes its shit written by virgins for virgins and everything is a stereotype
   all men have lived through too much and thought through too little  nietzsche
  false
time to start experimenting with psychedelics
  still too interior    what are you going have your deep ass nietzsche thoughts on if you have no life experience from which to draw questions everything you ponder will be second source drawing a picture based on things you see passing your window    mega wrong when it comes to emotion to think someone could write about romantic love or horrible depression without having some form of experience with them is ridiculous it would come across as cartoonish
  character development is overrated
  youll feel better once you get laid
isnt a major idea of reading that it is possible to imagine the experiences of others through the singular lens of our own life when they are illuminated through the brilliance of great writing
  look pal ive had more failed relationships than i have balls and buddy lemme tell you its a fucking mess down there
characters are supposed to be believable  yikes  imagine being this bad at literature
  although this holds for the writers who deal with a great breadth of emotional experiences it doesnt necessarily hold for writers who merely explore in great depth a a smaller handful of themes also how could you write persuasively about a life lived disconnected from love and meaningful relationships if you had never experienced prolonged isolation and the loneliness and despair that accompany it       funny that someone would bring nietzsche up as an example of the deep thoughts a shutin will never be able to have and articulate dude had sex fewer times than i have fingers on my right hand he lived in the mountains with his mother and sister his companions were primarily great works of philosophy and literature with a few exceptions and with this small breadth of experience he nevertheless managed to plumb deeper into the subterranean depths of the human spirit than anyone before or since
  correct on all counts op this is why having a rich emotional life in childhood embedded within a world of solitude and bitter alienation is the only real formative experience for an artist and anyone who was too isolated or exposed will likely come off like a resentful psychopath or uncomfortably unconscious normalfag subhuman very tricky indeed the childhood and adolescent romance as well as group bonding are also necessary but then actually attaining to stable forms of these rites of passage is corrosive to the creative spirit as well this is why most people here should never even bother reading or writing its just not meant for you and no amount of studying or being a neet faggot chantard or even sowing your wild oats and travel will gift you what necessarily is inborn and bequeathed by fate at the earliest periods of life     yes also the character models are horrifying for anyone who has good depth perception and strong aesthetic sense which heightens in naturalistic settings
  neither him nor she    those who believe that sexual experience corresponds to wisdom would do well to recall that cows among other creatures have sex     those who would say that human sex is different in light of the complexity linguistic capability and rationality of humans ought be reminded that virgins are humans
  nietzsche  a shutin    nietzsche was nothing like what we consider a shut in now neet shit no way i agree that he wasnt exactly a wild style party god but he still lived a relatively interesting life he moved around taught and liked to travel    direct selfobservation does not by any means suffice for selfknowledge we need history inasmuch as the past wells up in us in hundreds of ways indeed we ourselves are nothing other than what we sense at each instant of that onward flow    we need history
  i dont think its very important to accumulate loads of experiences just be sentimental remember some semantic history/tics that make the characters real     almost everyone has a family during their formative years 015 you can just write your character interactions based on that    when i was in undergrad i got published in my prestigious unis shitty journal for a short story i wrote of two brothers 8 10 hiking in the woods and then get attacked by an otherworldly monster my professor loved it and showed it to a department head who said it was better than grad school quality     and it was stupid hemingway rip off dialogue but i modeled the characters on my brother and i and used some language from childhood christmas videos that my autistic dad used to take
  i wouldnt speak so reductively and universally any aspect of the human experience can prove a labyrinth to creatively and sensitively explore and write about regarding sex and sexuality look at the beautiful poetry it inspired sappho to write the strange and complex philosophical fiction it impelled de sade to compose and the insights it stoked in freud and his acolytes and dissidents the point is that any aspect of the human experience can be fruitfully plumbed obviously those thinkers who cover the greatest breadth and depth are the ultimate artists shakespeare but you can be great without being the greatest
  a sensitive creative and intelligent person could find all the history they needed to fuel a life of authentic thought and artistic production in a small sample of life experiences someone like kafka needed little more than a troubled relationship with his father and some bad experiences working in modern bureaucracies to furnish the imagination with which he created some of the most celebrated literature in the canon
  man i thought that was such a nice quip it was but i realize i threw at the wrong person     this is actually a rather complicated topic experience and writing which has come up on here before many times once i gave three examples to illustrate its difficulty    john smith extraordinary experiences extraordinarily bad writing   charles dickens interesting experiences interesting writing  shakespeare boring experiences extraordinary writing  dostoevsky extraordinary experiences fake execution epilepsy extraordinary writkng    shakespeare was boring in the sense that he did not grow up in extreme poverty or captain an exploration    i agree that all experiences can be mined for brilliant observation i think this is because experience is almost entirely a consequence of idealism
  no its because gooks have no souls
    a lot of manga/anime creators and the people that like them are autists unsurprisingly    autists are just emotionally handicapped
stephen king was having a very bad day    some asshole had decided to use him again as a comparison for some author whose fame was thus increased in value without any remuneration and he was already so tired of being trapped in his body that it just snapped his camels back like a recently maligned straw    this is fucking bullshit he started to write but deleted it halfway through because of a memory that made him feel like he was a teenager writing in his diary again    and he was a grownass man a famous author no less  and yet he hadnt managed to escape the emotional state where he was being controlled by his parents    and they were dead    but he was pretty sure that the review would have pissed them off too  after all this was clearly just a shameless attempt to try and market some likely onehit hack who was only hoping to sell their story to whomever could make the most money off of it    he had the fleeting thought that hed like to kill that writer    of course the entirety of his oftenviolent and unsettling prose was the very fact that other than a rare expenditure of destruction upon the vehicle responsible for running him down like an insect he was an utter pacifist he only solved problems through words if he could at all help it    and for this moment there were none    you cant literally kill someone with words    the first person to have that idea to his knowledge at least other than some kind of biblical metatron thing was david lynch when he got a hold of frank herberts story which was even lynch would later admit a crazy idea    if there were a way however he would find it of that even if it were possibly the only only thing that could be said to hold such a position in his consciousness he was certain
but he was merely human    at least his body was he knew his imagination had come from something he couldnt explain but he also knew that trying to question it had only ever resulted in limitations to his success as a writer    he had achieved everything that any writer could ever hope to being placed alongside shakespeare if not having surpassed him for many whose familiarity with literature was derivative of their browsing through grocerystore fodder but he didnt really think they were valid judges of something as austere as what good writing meant which he had tried to explain but could never really pin down to a formula outside of what he wrote in the contemporary landscape of authors known by people    he couldnt get any bigger    hed hit the limits years ago and yet the idea that he was so unimportant to this writer who had used him like a meme or a trope of horror writing was like pure vitriol    extuperation is the word hed like to use but he wasnt sure it existed    they usually do when theyd come to him in the past but recently hed been running loggerheads against the voices hed been channeling    theyd started speaking to him in gobbledygook that is his usual practice of listening to the various universes through a cup affixed firmly to the closed bedroom door of the multiverse and trying to capture the chisme he could overhear had become alarmingly detached from anyone whose name he recognized    its like his parents were onto him and they switched to that coded language that parents always use when they want to hide things from their children    he was used to it and it usually just meant gathering information until he could backwardsmap the references but in this case he honestly couldnt even figure out how to gather the kind of information he was barely able to infer from the increasingly rare moments during which the door was closed in the first place    all the universes he could imagine talked to each other and he was just a weaver who saw narrative threads that he could connect in a way that to him seemed logical    he never pretended that his logic was any better than everyone hed ever met but he also couldnt pretend that it wasnt different    the kind of different he was overhearing lately made him feel like he couldnt even write about it though    it just belonged to a different universe
hed only ever been trying to write himself into another one since he was a kid    thats what writers do thats what hed learned from reading so much    he couldnt not read at a certain point and when that was isnt even important because its the moment he heard stories that he hadnt read yet    hed just found the limit at which other people wanted to read them    the great secret that made stephen king stephen king was that human beings want to do whatever they have to do in order to overcome what they perceive as evil    and for most that meant finding the kind of evil that could come after them    them specifically    actually them    and since most people believed the narratives of whoever controlled their physical wellbeing the trick was to simply remind them that they arent really in control of that outside of the forces of whatever whimsical universe decided to place them there    stephen king doesnt care about your physical wellbeing he has no direct knowledge of it    but human beings do and hes one of them    the langoliers do not understand this they were never informed that they were part of a fictional universe    stephen king didnt even invent them for that matter he just gave them another name    thats all writers ever do is give new names to the same cycle of suffering theyve been forced to participate in    if you can you wrest control of the pen and write yourself out of it    but that tradition was probably firstied by dante alighieri who writers all secretly hope was actually able to climb the tail of the beast and find their way to perdition    its a western bias to be sure but the metaphor exists in every human language    its the only story weve ever been telling but there are campfires that have yet to be lit
  lights campfire    so you want to see everything do you    well you cant    sorry about that    you exist in a human body so that means youre bound to a human existence and any perspective that includes literal omniscience in terms of what can be seen is going to just run loggerheads against the fact that human bodies are bound by the physical laws in which they find themselves existing    and youre just not more important than that no matter who you are

is there any way we can meddle with the brains of stem people to turn them into the philosophical zombies they so obviously want to be i am absolutely one hundred and ten percent serious about this it really is worth considering that we should look into some method of removing all the functions of the brain which allow stemfags to do anything other than whatever they need for their autistic little field honestly give me a mathematician and an ice cream scoop and half an hour love and passion nope not using it you dont need it scooop desire for meaning and authenticity dont think you even knew you had this scoooooop basic ethical and aesthetic sensibilities well known to any welladjusted three your old you certainly wont miss this scoooooooooop then we screw the top of his head back on and marvel at our creation the ideal stemfag reduced to his essential part a human calculator in the case of our mathematician and i genuinely believe that he would thank me if he could this is all stemfags want to be this is all theyre really capable of being    give them all to me and with an ice cream scoop ill fix all their problems they wont have to worry about any of the dastardly irritating aspects of life such as beauty or religious hope or virtue or even sensuality which will be merely sensedata once im done with my scoop    you really do have to understand noble reader that this isnt even in the slightest a cruel thing to do its removing from them those things which would do nothing but bother and irritate them till the end of their days they dont want these things which are so valuable to you and i noble reader in fact their every utterance is a plea to the universe to reduce and eliminate and simplify and i and my trusted associates at the clinic with our scoops would do nothing more than give them that freedom from unnecessaries that they so desire    its a perfect solution which frees us from having to listen to their opinions on things outside of objectively measurable phenomena pertaining to their field and their field alone and it frees them from the distractions such as moral intuitions and human consciousness which they are so disturbed by that they need to deny the very existence of these things    just picture it thousands upon thousands of stemfags walking out the clinic back towards their test tubes or whatever they do imagine the grotesque rictus smiles on their chinless anglo faces im finally free they would think were they not indeed finally free from that thing which they felt most keenly to be a burden on them qualia human consciousness and all the beauty passion love emotion all the duty the sense of virtues the religious hunger the ups and downs and bends and curves of being human all that aesthetic moral spiritual noise which plagued them like tinnitus until my act of kindness
  is this copypasta lol
  fucking lol why do philosofags get so butthurt about stemlords is it physics envy i smell
  t
  well done this should be posted in every thread on ayn rand/analytic philosophy from this point forward
  such a fucking edgelord
diverting from the discussion about the merits of an integral philosopher whose theories are not directly antiethical to philosophy itself  brainlets thinking that popper was a hard positivist and hated philosophy instead of being one of the most important personalities of 20th century philosophy  whats going on /lit/ dont judge a book by its cover
  i meant real physics not magic space black bill nye physics as in people who actually publish papers and do research
  imagine a world in which we are all enlightened by objective truths rather than offended by them  post racial iq averages
  the thing is ndgt is about as legit of a physicist as you can get he just also has a nice mustache and will spank me about antivaxxing
  physics and science too is about smoking weed and looking at the stars    change my mind
  can we fucking talk about popper for christs sake
  t
  implying  jordan peterson actually publishes papers and does research as well
no read the open society and its enemies
  no read the open society and its enemies  i havent read it but from what i can tell from a brief overview of it on wikipedia he seems to be right on point as well am i just being biased or something i think he had some pretty good points on the damage of platos political thought and his criticism of marxism
  but its bad redearch reeeeeeee
  one of the most important personalities of 20th century philosophy  yikes
he was wrong about freudism not being a science
keep the twobit jews off /lit/ plz ty faggots
  he was wrong about freudism not being a science  you are memeing right
  although popper was an advocate of toleration he said that intolerance should not be tolerated for if tolerance allowed intolerance to succeed completely tolerance would be threatened    d e r e w i g e _ _ _ _
  hes not wrong though have you never fucking read giacomo leopardi    no human trait deserves less tolerance in everyday life and gets less than intolerance    antisemitic faggot
  i think popper makes the mistake of reading the republic too literally as a work of political philosophy the entire premise of the work is to use the republic as an allegory of the soul something socrates makes repeated mention of throughout the text the republics class structure philosopher king guardians workers is identical to the tripartite theory of the soul wisdom justice appetite found in phaedrus which suggests that plato means the structure to be indication of how one should govern their own life reason rules appetite with the aid of justice platos noble lie where he tells of people being made of different metals can be contextualised with a segment from cratylus  socrates do you know what hesiod says daemons are  hermogenes no i dont remember  socrates do you remember that he speaks of a golden race which was the first race of human beings to be born  hermogenes yes i remember that  socrates he says this about it  since this race has been eclipsed by fate  they are called sacred daemons  they live on earth and are good  warding off evil and guarding mortal men  hermogenes so what  socrates well i dont think hes saying that the golden race is by nature made of gold but that it is good and fine i consider it a proof of this that he calls us a race of iron  hermogenes thats true  socrates so dont you think that if someone who presently exists were good hesiod would say that he too belonged to the golden race  hermogenes he probably would  socrates are good people any different from wise ones  hermogenesno they arent  socrates it is principally because daemons are wise and knowing daemones i think that hesiod says they are named daemonsdaimonesin our older attic dialect we actually find the word daemones so hesiod and many other poets speak well when they say that when a good man dies he has a great destiny and a great honor and becomes a daemon which is a name given to him because it accords with wisdom and i myself assert indeed that every good man whether alive or dead is daemonic and is correctly called a daemon  and i do think that socrates daemon is a representative of his wisdom so being imbued with gold is as much to say that you should be wise and good and the dictatorship of the philosopher king is as much to say that an individual should be ruled by reason a very prevalent theme in all of platos dialogues this is what i mean by suggesting that popper reads plato far too literally and it makes his claims to being able to sort platos and socrates views quite dubious   there are a myriad of other problems with the book as well
  antisemitic  how is that an insult

  whoa man like what if there were no borders and no countries man there would like be world peace

  the only thing i know about popper is his falsifiability stuff    what would he have said if he knew his argument would be used by intolerant people to silence people they disagree with simply by labeling them intolerant

  i think karl popper was secretly a cryptofascist like foucault think about it who else could come up with something as genius as the paradox of intolerance and his scientific methodology could best be described as eternal war transposed into the domain of the idea     based cryptofascist popper

  look at him    he was just that goddam handsome    almost like a white man or something

what is the literary equivalent of ykk

  as a ykk fan ive to admit that texhnolyze has btfo ykk
  no shit texhnolyze btfo every anime except lain
  except kon
  kon sucks ass

its a nice idea to think that humanity dying out could be as peaceful and quiet as ykk  itll never happen though either humanity dies in the fire of war or it never dies out at all

  holy shit there are people on /lit/ with taste
  haibane renmei  lain  texhnolyze
  not even mentioning niea_7
  sure if all youre taking into consideration is cute girls but more seriously haibane renmei is by far the comfiest of the three
  its probably how the west is going to die out and japan with nobody having enough children we will sadly slip out quietly
  have to disagree out of the three the only one that affected me in any way was texhnolyze lain suffers from being too abstract and haibane stays too vague if that makes sense texhnolyze was brutal enough that it could fully commit to its themes and truly communicate something    not the west we arent slipping out but replacing ourselves with people who are aliens to our culture youll likely see identity politics and racial tensions worsen and eventually spiral into catastrophe japan however might go peacefully unless they get forced to follow our example which is certainly possible
  haibane stays too vague    that seems to be a common criticism of the series but i rather like it when some things are left answered but thats just me
  i just didnt think the show delivered very much regarding the themes it dealt with sin forgiveness etc it felt like you were kept at too far a distance from everything since you never really knew what was going on
  id say one hundred years of solitude if you throw out most of the erotica out of it
  i started reading it until it got to the point that the two female robots had to kiss to share the video mail or whatever at which point i realized it was just stupid japanese moe wank
  heres your you
what is the literary equivalent of texhnolyze
still no physical english release baka  only manga id consider buying
  people having less children now than in the past doesnt mean that this goes on forever  at some point the population stabilizes around some figure it doesnt dwindle to zero do you really think that in a nation of millions no one would ever procreate

what are some books that youre adding to your christmas list this year /lit/
 arthur schopenhauer parerga and paralipomena on authorship and style
absolutely 100 agreed and i think everyone who uses this site has at least an inner understanding of this which is why precisely not a single post here carries any sort of authority
is he right is jordan peterson a crazy person
  you can stop shilling your book here vox
  he is jordan peterson
    go back to sperging out about accurate reviews of your book vox
  0025 yes    2650 no    5175 maybe    7699 it depends    rolling
  check em
  what hes written is pretty typical of a jungian i dont really get why people keep talking about him when jp hasnt said anything that original
  vox has been caught shilling his shit before then lying about it even though his own email was tagged lol so i wouldnt be surprised hes trying to cash in on someone elses fame which is low but i suppose this could be good if it introduces petersonfags to the jq which vox to his credit is usually pretty good on though he brings his idiotic christian baggage to it
  he explains a lot of stuff about humans personnality biology that kind of stuff hes also a pretty good speaker
  the jq    schizophrenic rambling dont fall for the middleman minority meme abdul
  t chaim
  middleman minority  jews are a social plague theyre much worse than that redditbitch
  jews get suppressed for centuries  antisemitism become more and more shuned  society advance faster and faster  meanwhile islamics jews hatingshithole are behind the philosemit west by severals generations    what an awful plague
  fuck off vox were not even pirating that refuse
  jews have been suppressed and removed historically due to their behavior and jews are the ones importing their arab cousins into the west learn to speak english and be less retarded
muh gamer gate  muh shitty band  muh literal christianity  has a forward by a fag    why do boomers pay attention to this fag
  well yeah they were middleman minorities and their entire religion and culture was born out of a want to make themselves stand out from their culturaly similar neighbords    anyway its still true that antisemits countries are rather shit which prove you wrong
  culturaly similar  antisemits countries are rather shit  arabs and jews are semitic cousins you have no clue what you are talking about dont insert yourself into discussions about the jewish problem from here on
  are you okay you seems rather upset    by culturally similar i was talking about og israel neighbords     you have no clue what you are talking about    why     you still havent answered my question btw
peterson is what i like to call conservative progressive meaning he doesnt actually disagree with the progressive agenda he just recognizes that theyre asking too much of the common man too quickly because he has the same goals as progressives he acts as a mediating influence for the right hes intentionally trying to market himself to right wing youth in order to convert them and hell even admit it    and yes he is actually insane

    stephen king writes over 50 novels  we only remember about 10 of them as being really good  george rr martin takes over five years to release a new book in his series  everybody remembers each release as being notable
what was crimson kings tax policy huh stephen how was he going to rule the discord have you thought about that you stupid shit  wtf george
   remembers each release as being notable  lol
  the only thing youre high on is your own farts
yes
yeah
  everybody remembers each release as being notable  only the squatting passage is notable
  did george r r martin really do that
  no but it sounds right doesnt it and in the end thats all that matters
  what squatting passage
  the part in adwd where dany shits herself    and youll notice people only remember it because its from the most recent book

  to be honest if a book only takes one year to make from inception to full release then it is probably not very good maybe it will be entertaining but its most likely not going to be great literature do you expect to learn anything new about yourself or the world from reading stephen king book 9338 you wont believe the twist  thats not to say that the drivel the fat fuck on the right puts out is great literature either
  bullshit time has nothing to do with quality
  stephen king is extremely gay
  stephen king  multiple works of

what i enjoyed the most back in my early teenage years were books like the odyssey the elder edda el poema del mío cid le chanson de roland and lord alfred tennysons idylls of the king  i loved reading herodotus histories livys history of rome plutarchs lives but i felt like modern history lacked that same kind of heroic grand narrative feeling  i also kind of enjoyed reading more humorous works like henry fieldings tom jones charles dickens pickwick papers  i was kind of into nietzsche baudelaire for a certain time but mostly because they seemed very depressing melancholic  i was very much a loner stuck in my own little fantasy worlds with few friends i cared more for reading about genghis khan or king cyrus the great than i couldve for talking about sports or girlfriends  after that i mostly stopped reading  when i was about 1518 years old what i was mostly into was anime stuff like neon genesis evangelion and clannad resonated with me a lot more than anything i couldve read out of everything i gave a try the count of montecristo was probably the only book i actually enjoyed reading  i kind of enjoyed norwegian wood but i couldnt stand its sex scenes especially since they all seemed so dispassionate so lacking in heart  many of the recommendations i got like jack london borges hemingway and walter scott had no characters i could care for  i also got a few science fiction and horror fantasy heinlein clarke lovecraft recommendations from a few people but everything i read felt very superficial all of the characters seemed like a means to plot i didnt feel like the writers tried to pour in any love into their works  whatever you feel like reading will depend on what kind of person you are and what you think of reading as
  you think the iliad is a good book to start with literature i want to buy a book for my brother in christmas and i dont know very much but he wants to read
a scanner darkly
  i read the odyssey when i was 12 years old but i didnt finish reading the iliad until i was 19 years old   i think a better starting point for a 12 year old might be something like charles dickens david copperfield or jonathan swifts gullivers travels which are some examples of the first stuff i read excluding childrens fantasy like the chronicles of narnia or the lord of the rings
  siddhartha is a pretty nice read when youre a teenager

im thinking of looking into eastern philosophy any suggested reading for me    ive already read some western philosophy    thanks
  ezra pounds translations is as good an intro as any
  start with the upanishads the i ching and confucius analects
  some good beginner texts include the tao te ching confucius analects dhammapada and the bhagavadgita the quran is not exactly easy but you will need to read it and some hadith in order to understand most islamic philosophy once youve read these you will have an idea of some of the main currents in eastern thought and you can decide where to go from there if you had specific questions about what to read from a certain school or religion i might be able to give a detailed answer      ezra pounds translations  he was influenced by eastern texts but that wouldnt be eastern philosophy itself still good stuff though i might ass
  i might ass    i might too   pounds book of translations includes some nice eastern texts from china india and egypt if that is eastern you are right in that it is probably not what op was looking for any recommendations on mongolian or tibetan
  that all sounds good to me i have a certain interest in the ideas that inform buddhism life inescapably being filled with suffering ego and desire being sources etc    im open to all forms of writing essays letters poetry novels dialogues as long as the ideas are expressed in the medium and are tangible im all for it
  any recommendations on mongolian or tibetan  mongolia mostly adopted tibetan buddhism and as far as im aware of there are not any major doctrinal developments/innovations/texts which originate there if there were there preservation was not helped by the soviet neardestruction of mongolian buddhism within tibetan buddhism you have a vast field of texts across the 4 major schools and the 5th additional smaller one of jonang many of them are dense and require and extensive knowledge of earlier texts and buddhist philosophy in tibetan buddhism you have the ideas from tantric scriptures merging with various early mahayana teachings about stuff like tathagatagarbha and sunyata in combination with aspects of the prebuddhist bon religion and occasionally stuff like shaivism and yogacara in order to decently understand some of this stuff you need to have read the discourses by buddha himself in addition to the tantric/mahayana texts/thinkers the tibetan schools draw on there may be a few shorter and easier tibetan buddhist texts which you can sort of intuitively understand if youve read a bit of the pc but im not aware of them     of course in the english translations sometimes a lot of helpful notes are provided but certainly if you are going to study tibetan thought deeply youll need to read more than 2 or 3 texts i myself am interesting in studying jonang buddhism because it differs from the other tibetian schools in identifying emptiness as belonging to the other/conditionedphenomena and not the ultimate reality/buddhamatrix itself but thats just what im drawn to if you are into lucid dreaming also there is a school of tibetian buddhism which integrates it as part of meditative practice which is pretty rare in eastern thought tldr if you enjoy studying buddhism and are willing to read a dozen texts and intro/overview books tibetan buddhism has a lot of interesting stuff with texts from certain schools of eastern thought like tibetan buddhism vedanta and the more enigmatic sufis like ibn arabi you sometimes need to build up to them by reading the preliminary stuff first as one does in western philosophy       i have a certain interest in the ideas that inform buddhism life inescapably being filled with suffering ego and desire being sources etc  this notion is found in eastern thought but sometimes is misunderstood schopenhauer notably writes on this but generally scholars think he misunderstood buddhism and what it taught on this the best texts which illustrate this would probably be selections from the pc where buddha speaks on this id get bhikku bodhis translations of his various discourses the other types of eastern thought which most involve this would be jainism and hinduism i have not read any jain texts but vedantic texts and other generic hindu texts like the bhagavadgita include this theme/understanding sometimes

  i read that book by lao tzu it was pretty comfy
  you will never live the life of a monk in a comfy hut in the mountains  you will never be enlightened    fuck bros it hurts so much i just want to grasp the true nature of being
  can the hand which grasps grasp itself
  the pc  pali canon
  yet the hand is not of relevance here but the function of grasping the question becomes can the grasping grasp itself for the grasping has only itself to grasp from it being its own ground and the answer i give is yes it can grasping grasps grasping by its very nature it is merely the individual who must commit themselves to turning away from the things grasped to the fact of grasping itself this is just another analogy for consciousness which is its own and only basis for knowing itself knowing knowing knowing and so on though ultimately we end in emptiness realizing that even the knowing itself is but something known and that consciousness is therefore ultimately without attribute alas parabrahman has been reached
  the question becomes can the grasping grasp itself  but this was the question originally
  yes
  also i would add that for anyone thinking about getting into reading the more dense and inaccessible buddhist texts that add dozens of additional philosophical/metaphysical concepts on top of whats already taught in the pc this is one of the better intro books out there that one can use to familiarize yourself with many of the concepts first
  fair i was simply separating the hand which is the thing grasping from the act of grasping itself since it matters not whether it is the hand which grasps or the foot or the teeth or anything else also capable of it i was reducing it to the function itself and not the thing performing the function which is still secondary to the function
  tao te ching stephen mitchell translation  a maybe a couple others like red pine  tao the watercourse way by alan watts  bhadavadgita  that thou art the wisdom of the upanishads by ramakrishna puligandla  thich nhat hanhs sutra translations  asian philosophies 4th edition by john m koller this is literally the only textbook ive ever wanted to own its very good stuff a lot of it is the closest possible thing to an appropriate summary of this sort of material which is generally beyond summary    taoism is the most mystifying  hinduism is the most philosophically elaborate  buddhism is the most accessible/practical
was jesus a dharma master
  yes
  thanks
  youre welcome
    how so
  and it came to pass that as they went in the way a certain man said unto him lord i will follow thee whithersoever thou goest and jesus said unto him foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests but the son of man hath not where to lay his head and he said unto another follow me but he said lord suffer me first to go and bury my father jesus said unto him let the dead bury their dead but go thou and preach the kingdom of god and another also said lord i will follow thee but let me first go bid them farewell which are at home at my house and jesus said unto him no man having put his hand to the plough and looking back is fit for the kingdom of god    luke 95762
is reading in public a pseud thing to do im getting selfconscious about my reading habits

  i dont really care but i get stares every now and again
why why the fuck would you write this
  that cover fuckin rocks
  the canon man wrote a fucking fantasy novel  im legitimately shocked does he secretly enjoy genre fiction
bloom is in a state of constant agony over his inability to write thats why he jerks off to shakespeare so much he thinks that by being associated with one of the goats by becoming the shakespeare guy hes be conferred some of that greatness and not die as an unattractive footnote to the legacy of frye
  not secretly this is a sequel to a book by another author one that he quite publicly admires
to be fair you have to have a very thorough understanding of the canon to appreciate the flight to lucifer
what is this jewish magick
di/lit/tante avantteen who started reading last year with dostoyevsky is shocked that learned masters like bloom enjoy and write books outside the canon and muh high literature  happens a lot
  honestly it sounds kind of interesting apparently it was influenced by fucking star wars i doubt anybody itt has even read it but im curious about it in a morbid way
brother drops me off at my house after helping him move some furniture  says he wants to wash his hands   yeah just wait here for one second  his gf is a brown mutt  hide my stacks of right wing literature close all my doors  ok come in  find the white nationalist manifesto sitting on a chair in the living room  ohshit  halfass hide it face down while hes in the bathroom  he walks around the living room probably wondering why im acting like such a weirdo  but he doesnt find out that i read books or hold political views  wew identity crisis averted
what a loser
  im sure my brother already saw all the hitler pics and savitri devi and serrano pdfs on my computer he never said anything about it tho
my brother voted for gary johnson and beto is an avid redditor and assures me the bernie wouldve won hes also a waiter and only reads sci fi and fantasy like gibson never read lord of the rings because of his adhd that he claims to not know how to schedule an appointment to receive medication for he flunked out of school his first semester and has been hanging around my parents house since playing fighting games with his friends who also dropped out or drinking extremely bitter beer    i dont worry what he thinks of what i read at all
  i know i dont talk about my political views among other reasons because i am a bad representative of them and theyre too important to be associated with me until i change my ways for the better     i have a printer paper sized copy of mein kampf printed by some ns group sitting spineout on the shelf of one of the closets i closed havent read it yet though cause id need a table without a computer on it just to be able to read it comfortably   if devi wasnt so extreme shed probably be a good entry point being a woman and a hindu and all ive read a bit of forever and ever     my brother is a pretty cool guy and i care about my family
  weak if youre desperate enough to physically own such books then you should have the courage to speak your mind i dont even agree with it if a relative paraded his concubine into my abode that would be it i would tell them adieu and to never to contact me again
  if youre desperate enough to physically own such books then you should have the courage to speak your mind  based   if a relative paraded his concubine into my abode that would be it i would tell them adieu and to never to contact me again  cringe
  what a mongoloid
  she wasnt with him and my familys been through enough with divorce and deaths recently without adding nazi drama into the mix especially given that trying to redpill my brother is such a morally grey situation    courage takes time to build and anyone that denies the value of their own family is basically antitraditional in my eyes unless theyre just shittier people but i love my family and i want them to be comfortable and successful     the onions pupper
  its always anime posters
  its always anime posters who are really based and nice   ftfy
i have a brother as well and he has a gf he just got suspended for threatening to kill some girl and has to see a psychologist
gf is a brown african girl  tells me that our kids will probably have brown eyes because pale genes are recessive and brown people have stronger genetics  say if thats true then how come white people are the master race  she laughs that i could never get away with saying this racist shit around a white girl  i tell her thats why ive got to date brown girls so i can be my true white supremacist self  make a hail hitler salute and laugh say its okay were dating because indians are the original aryans  constantly talk about what an absolute hero mussolini and dannunzio were play faccetta nera and tell her shes got to listen to this great song  her education has been entirely technical she has no idea who mussolini was or what the italians were doing or what fascism is    recently ive been blasting peste noire around the house and shes been giving me weird looks but i really like this girl hail victory my aryan brother
  no its always anime posters that are deluded   what kind of right wing idolizes the product of syphilis stricken perverted monkeys
  high school is tough dont be too hard on him the way girls are especially now no one can blame a boy for wanting to kill one of them not that thats legitimate way to deal with it     you sound like a bro peste noire dannunzio varg so dont throw your genes away also is any of gimmedanoodsios poetry translated into english that you know of    what kind of right wing idolizes the product of syphilis stricken perverted monkeys  i cant answer the question if it doesnt make sense
  coward
   close but you thought fast good going anon you are a counter cultural rebel against the establishment you gotta be careful dont dox yrself for nothing remember silence exile cunning  
  the japanese are diseased and depraved  you fell for their propaganda
  probly didna notice people tend to censor out a lot from their perception you might wanna be a bit more discreet though just in case no reason to let yourself be hurt through laziness we are living under occupation in a certain sense so do not trust anyone who tells you to dox yourself
    i want to have my life better together before i start trying to tell people how to live theirs the prejudice against me in a situation where im proselytizing as a hypocrite would be completely justified in my view     i havent watched anime in years but the japanese are a great example of ethnocentrism and paganism both being compatible with modernity they have their problems but so does every race  and many of them are imported from the west
  shes a nice girl educated good genes hard working as hell and wants nothing more than to settle down and pump out 5 or 6 kids with me shes even said she doesnt mind if i leave her some day but she wants to bear my children and have a blue eyed baby girl that looks like me a bit of a normie i guess wants to live in the city which may be a deal breaker but its like they say perfect is the enemy of good    i cant speak to his poetry but im pretty sure you can get many of his books through interlibrary loan also and this is only tangentially related but hollebecque and iggy pop did an album together its pretty based if you know what im saying        watch out anon i had a couple buddies like that in highshcool it started with weird stuff like that then got fucky one broke into a buddies house and started capping people in their beds almost got me actually another one slit his grandmamas throat and dumped her in the woods    just saying maybe its puberty acting up but keep your eye on that kid theres some dark forces out there waiting to get in mens heads and he starts breaking with reality at all all kinds of stuff can happen might be a good time to invest in a lock for your bedroom door
    how is dannunzios work on a purely literary level i watched a talk by jonathan bowden about him and he seems like a really fascinating guy
right wing   afraid of a mut girl  anime poster   hhahhahahaha tanks for the laugh
  apparently hes a genius in italian his work in english is very flowery for lack of a better word not to say that in a bad way but its not what youre probably expecting
  like i said earlier in this thread i dont want to preach to people who are in many ways superior to me about how to live their lives while not living that way myself but im sure you can find a white girl thats all ill say about it     i dont know anything about hollebecque    i was asking about translations because i havent read it but just going off of his reputation he was known as the poet and the prophet i assume its great    im like this from spending years as a nihilistic leftist
    actually if youre interested in dannunzio you should put his work on the back burner and read the pike by lucy hugheshallett its an all around great biography full of literary merit in its own right that goes into detail about his life and work
  brown mutt  anon why are you such a hateful individual   your brother loves her cant you accept it  its just the melanin  humans first appeared in africa and they were all dark skinned some became light skinned when they migrated to the north  they arent inferior even if they are different  nothing wrong with race mixing
  do white people do this kinda stuff    i thought you guys didnt cap people  disenchanted
  i dont live with my brother i think my parents said he wasnt being serious but the school is being cautious he consumes a lot of gory media which maybe influenced him once in school i drew a burning building which my teacher saw became alarmed and tried to have me see a psychologist its understandable this paranoia when humans relish on tragedies though this relishment does evidently influence more tragedies
  hate to break it to you anon but one youve sunk beneath the poverty line colours tend to blur its all the same shit only difference is that niggers have made an industry out of being whiny fucking losers
  once in school i drew a burning building which my teacher saw became alarmed and tried to have me see a psychologist  lol and people wonder why society is full of pussies these days  still though its easy to ignore these things till its too late if hes on any sort of drugs prescribed or not or he starts breaking with reality proceed with extreme caution
  anon why are you such a hateful individual  im not  your brother loves her cant you accept it  probably i dont have the heart to stand him up at his wedding  its just the melanin  its more than just melanin its thousands of years of divergent evolution that affected many traits  humans first appeared in africa and they were all dark skinned some became light skinned when they migrated to the north  no one can be sure if this theory is true or not but even if it were it wouldnt be a good point because we are so different now i would think even the blacks today are very different from that hypothetical prehistoric ancestor the oldest hominid bones found so far were found in france though  they arent inferior even if they are different  human races are inferior and superior to each other in different ways its natural to prefer your own because your genes have been selected to like your own peoples way of life   nothing wrong with race mixing  there are many negatives involved with race mixing that are not present in intraracial unions  and many of them effect the child who will have to deal with a split identity a split loyalty and always standing out
tfw mixed race and happier betterlooking more talented and more successful than   what an insecure loser
  good for you i dont want to do you harm i just dont want it to be legal for you to marry my cousin
  have you ever thought that institutional racism is harmful  not that id try to steal your girl of course im into italians
  institutional racism cant be harmful if there is only one race in the state
  interesting  sorry if i sort of lured you into answering to this points  i was curious to hear what a right wing would answer to these common criticisms i always heard my teachers bring out whenever racial debates came up  i disagree thought just so you know
  but im sure you can find a white girl  sure but i like my gf now i could also probably find a girl with bigger breasts or more fragrant farts but it wouldnt be her and im not going to beat myself up worrying about it      all this projection  pretty sure op never said anything about his situation in life       youre halfway to the real red pill op from here its just a matter of realizing race is as much if not more so a spiritual vocation as a genetic one opening your eyes to the (((white progressive problem))) realizing race mixing is normal and that all countries have a teleological potential race in the genetic cultural and spiritual sense which they are progressing towards and becoming a nationalistidealist
  the world doesnt work like that it is with mirth that i anticipate the us becoming 30 hispanic by 2050 because of white trash faggots like you

  im actually 64 brownish high iq chad but sure assume who i am in order to make yourself feel better
  race   no such thing exist  at a certain point in history 2 or more ethnicities mixed up  its delusional and unatteinable
  i mean pure race
  i could explain the answers better and more philosophically but   1 i didnt think you actually cared to begin with because this is 4channel  2 i worked for 12 hours today and im probably going to go to bed soon so its best not to get super deep and i probably wouldnt do my own views justice in this kind of mindset anyway     oh youre a culturedthug/spengler fan   i think youre right and wrong but i dont want to open this can of worms i took you to have different views though    when the us becomes 30 hispanic it will be because of mostly white and jewish capitalist elites not because of white trash faggots like me who have no political power       if you get super literal about it yeah approximate races still distinctly exist though even if the edges are blurry no one will confuse someone whose last 8 sets of ancestors were german with someone whose last 8 sets of ancestors were subsaharan african even if there was admixture from the other group at some point they look and act totally different
  im actually 64 brownish high iq chad  be that as it may youll always be american
  this  white and black races dont exist and are american concepts because they are all children who cant understand nuiance of different ethnicities of white people like there are in europe it always blows their mind when they find out the anglo founding fathers were worried about germanic and italian migration to america
  i normally hate /pol/tards but you come off as respectful and not retarded nice one op
  americans had there own ethnogenesis the american of european decent of today is descendant from the founding stock the european american is similar to a german or a frenchman the overarching european decendency is called white  almost everyone in european countries or rather in almost every country on this planet knows who is actually part of their ethnic group and who is just part of the citizenry in germany for example there is an invisible divide between native germans and turks for example even if they speak fluent german and work almost everybody knows it at least implicitly if not explicitly the same thing is true for americans white is the descriptor used to signify this similar thing you will experience in germany the former ethnicities dont matter anymore the english germans french poles even the irish and italians have become american in a process of ethnogenesis one ethnicity at a time everyone who isnt of european decent is out of the core club and will feel the divide like people born of turkish parents in germany of course the club broadened over time but almost anybody who doesnt look like they are of european decent of any kind never made the cut  the racial categories make sense from the american perspective its useless to apply european ethnic differentiation and nuance to the usa
are terence mckennas descriptions of the machine elves true art    corollary can you defend your question in light of your definition of true art
in this case its your own mind producing the image you could argue this has its footing in art but its not really
id like to start with the greeks preferably with the most easily understandable ones what book should i read first
begin with hesiod  read homer  the three tragics works right afterwards  if you wanna read history theres herodotus thucydides and xenophon  the only greek philosophy you should read are the presocratics everything since socrates is pure intellectual masturbation  diogenes of sinope was alright and its precisely because he wasnt a platonist philosopher
  tragedians not tragics   tragedian is a noun tragic is an adjective
  first read some stuff for context both some information about the major mythological explaining briefly the history of ancient greece the minoans myceneans dark age and the rise of the classical greece we tend to think of today  no need to read a specific book like anon claims you just want the basic information and to actually take in and process the information  then start with either the iliad fitzgerald or just go straight to platos apology and the republic depending on where your interests lie  myths and stories of war or philosophy    pic related is the best greek chart by far the extra fluff books are unnecessary you should go straight to the meat and read whatever interests you and suits your needs for context based on your response to it
   read the greeks   dont read socrates lol he was a fag  look how cool i am for ignoring one of the most major philosophers in history
  you misunderstand hes even more retarded that that hes saying dont read anything postsocrates as in dont read plato or aristotle
  read this then you can home in on the bits that interest you
  wow thats even worse hes literally just diogenes because he was a degenerate shitshow who was edgy and ppl fedoratip his actions for some reason
  read the apology of socrates then crito then eutyphro

what did the nobel laureate mean by this
i wouldnt know   because whenever i think about listening to dylan i just put on leonard cohen instead   semi related  what works of literature will help you become a better songwriter
  time regained
not literature
  he was busy being born his lyrics often reflect that
  what did the nobel laureate mean by this  it was just a weak attempt at ironic humor this style is common amongst jews  an affectation of both wisdom and humor at the same time but with no substance  haha  im benjamin button  get it
  just read what you like and write based on that forcing it can make you inauthentic
  what works of literature will help you become a better songwriter  just tell your story write  a lot you can toss that embarrassing tripe in the fire paper is cheap you are writing on paper are you not if you try to record using a medium other than paper or audio recording then you will likely stay nigger tier because during your fumbling with whatever bullshit medium you are using you will likely lose key words  and with them your meter
  i always took it to mean that he had adopted a cynical and sober view of life and then had regained the levity of childhood
  that makes sense because cohen wrote all of hack dylans lyrics
  that is not what that lyric means you mong dylan is saying that hes learned more about the world and after his experiences he feels younger and more aspired it has nothing to do with benjamin button fancies antisemitism has affected your reading comprehension my man
  he always struck me as being affectatious and insincere his criticism was excessive and his observations were often very weak this was common of songwriters/poets/philosophers of his golden age there was a lot of potential for a true philosopher to rise out of that mess and yet no one did afaiac antisemitism or not i made all of these observations about him long before i knew that he was a jew  after his experiences he feels younger and more aspired  that only explains his self appraisal of himself at an older age  ah but i was so much older then  leaves me with a sense of selfaggrandizement
  the song is about him realizing his politics were bullshit cause life is too complicated to have black and white answers to anything and accepting that hes just one guy and he neednt worry about the world so much
  this i was about to write something similar but now i dont have to
  oh you poor fags    we do need to worry about the world deeply    there is no ultimate truth is itself a statement of ultimate truth    therefore shits real what you do matters politics matters get your shit together pay attention to what the fuck is going on and figure out what to do about it
  i bet you watch a lot of rick and morty huh
  saved for my yikes folder
its literally a song about becoming redpilled     equality i spoke their word   as if a wedding vow  ah but i was so much older then  im younger than that now    good and bad i defined these terms  quite clear no doubt somehow  ah but i was so much older then  im younger than that now
  the thing is dylan became disillusioned with exactly that part of the whole folk scene and he was only in it for the art in the first place which he moved on to do he hated when people said he was a philosopher and that being a philosopher is what people expected of him he said it himself that he had had it with the whole scene and the people there like allen ginsberg and all those degenerates
hes saying i used to be a tryhard fag who thought he was smarter than everyone but now i realize i was stupid the funny part though is that this was on his final album before he went electric and entered the most tryhard im super smart phase of his career
  its about the dour ideology of being a figure of protest the whole song is about the pitfalls of this ideology which estranges him from the real beauty of life which is carefree and artistic
  the best and most artful phase  youre just mad cause you dont understand poetry
    i hate bob dylan
  cohen wrote all of dylans lyrics  i bet you think shakespeare was francis bacon too
  yes he sucks big time

ive got a massive tome of literally 150 original grimms fairytales and while i leave some out that are too way out there plot wise or simply too gruesome/lewd mine loves them to a fault admittedly im talking about a barely 4 year old here so i need to paraphrase some parts but as time goes by i will first start reading the original texts and then introduce something more substantial
  wow thats autism for you
i dont know what level shes at but winnie the pooh dr seuss the little prince aesops fables roald dahl and alice in wonderland should all be given to her at some point  also the simplified version of gullivers travels by martin jenkins and chris riddell is god tier unlike most kids versions of gulliver it has all four parts and gulliver is still a bitter misanthrope by the end  not a single part of the original is left out also you will love reading it to her because the illustrations are god tier whenever i reread the original i always look at the illustrations after i finish each part     why would that be ironically
  based pedoposter   u read fucking strict logics to gurls
  there is a well known guy that did illustrations to the grim fairytales that is absolutely creepy i would never expose a kid to this kids need to feel the world is loving and safe they can discover the shittyness by themselves later
  because everyone memes start with the greeks
  i choose them wisely as mentioned above and the illustrations in mine are cutesy and dainty fuck off helen lovejoy

  same as would any nonforebrainlet
  i fucked her
  shakespeare has a pretty big forehead
  prettier and less slutty
  i dont believe you
foucault prove me wrong
  pic rel the og bigbrained nibba  ariston of argos dubbed him platon meaning broad on account of his robust figure or that plato derived his name from the breadth πλατύτης platytēs of his eloquence or else because he was very wide πλατύς platýs across the forehead
  fucko
  usually i prefer little to no makeup but right is rell done
  cringe fuck no hes an egghead with a tiny forehead here look brainlet the perfect proof that youre utterly wrong
  im a hardcore fan of hers literally have seen all her old vlogs and she always dated absolute chads theres no way they would be on here or that they even read     she was always hot even before fame
  shes a real 10/10
  youve fallen for my trap card you dumb fucking idiot tricked by perspective how serendipitous into thinking kant has a huge forehead well allow me to introduce to you what kant really looked like if you think this diminutive dome beats the prodigious brow foucault is blessed with then well youre stupid

  nope peoples writing skills have objectivity dropped in the modern era at least is it that suprising that as the world gets more and more consumeristic that capacity artistic value drops
    who the fuck cares about others    i just started to read clasical rethoric and practiced figures of speech an ive improved a shit ton    youre asking why 99 of people suck at something    it takes years of hard work practice and study to be good at a single skill  most normalfags lack any creativity to do art  may as well ask why 98 of americans cant into fitness
  writing skills have objectivity dropped in the modern era at least  prove it nigga    oh wait u cant    tee hee
youre dim to compare yourself to others and take praise into consideration over anything but a mere hint on whether or not you could make at least some money with that skill in the future    even dimmer to feel sad about the fact that someone out there has a bigger dick than you
  nope peoples writing skills have objectivity dropped in the modern era at least  what the fuck are you on about retard the west has been largely illiterate until second half of 19th century and well into 20th century for most things outside anglos baguettes and nazis stop this idiotic babby romanticization of the past
  not the guy you responded to but i always figured that the people who truly suck at writing now are the same ones that wouldve been illiterate 1 or 2 hundred years ago the difference being that now they have to read/write a bit to live in modern society
  my dick is pretty big desu
  post pics
  nno
democratization of literacy the proportion of shitty to good writing probably hasnt changed since antiquity the difference is that the sheer morass of shitty troglodyte literature exploding into the noosphere confuses the terrain so much that actual good writing is not really feasible and the linguistic turn in academia the ontologization of saussiran structural linguistics has destroyed even the possibility of good prose since one must be so careful about his/her/xis/their choice of even something as inane as pronouns is literacy itself patriarchal good prose is just the latest subtlest form of colonialism or something
are there any books that will bluepill me again is there a going back brehs

the redpill is an illusion a trap for the ego  there are no pills  just you and your retardation
  believing you are redpilled is ironically the biggest blue pill you can have  instead of searching for the actual truth you have a set of beliefs others told you how the world works   books can help but its your own journey man but if you want the biggest bluepill just do exactly what others do around you
  maybe psychiatric medication and mainstream media but it wont help completely    porn might help and weed and reddit and cartoons maybe play some fortnite and watch female game streamers and grow a beard and get a nintendo switch and drink craft beer and read some steven pinker and listen to sam harris podcast and get a curvy gf that does rollerderby
  i reblupilled myself by listening to zoomer hiphop music
  almost forgot get a cat and joke about how you are in a submissive relationship with it and tell the world how she always gets what she wants and call yourself a hooman servant maybe be vocally childfree and retweet articles about climate change
  be vocally childfree  whats wrong about hating children they are fucking shit
  im adulting i did a thing today im adulting
  soiboi getting a gf  if you do all this prepare for that girl to eventually cuck you for a real man
  t everyone is wrong  everyone except me
  oh give me a break christfag
i dont want to live anymore
  true enough but that is not gonna help us
  climate change isnt real  cats are bad and also reddit  lol
  this plus  make facebook and reddit account
  implying these people care about anything other than the headline of the article  implying cat people arent fucking weirdos   reddit    yikes
  implying cat people arent fucking weirdos  youre a weirdo
  ironic reddit appropriation isnt a sign of a collapsing and profoundly banal counterculture which has none of the right to its previously natural imperiousness towards outsiders  you all are kind of gay and havent noticed
  nonworking animals are a substitute of children
  its not about climate change being real its about our ability to stop it
  much better than children
  and get a curvy gf that does rollerderby    having any kind of girlfriend puts you about 10 steps ahead of all the bitter incel permavirgins who invented the numale character just to feel better about themselves
  you dont need books for that itll happen inevitably in your early thirties one you realize that youve been an edgy contrarian youngster with delusions of intellectualism and seeing beyond the pale
  see this is the problem with the fucking internet it promotes these inherently unrewarding parasocial interactions between people with nothing in common but a pathology whether thats incels or enabling people to act like children well into their adulthood its just a delusion there arent pills just opinions if you truly dont wanna hold your opinions anymore its as simple as changing them the real answer here is to read and consume media produced by people who challenge your current worldview in a productive way that you can engage with in other words read everything read platos collected works then aristotle then augustine then aquinas then kierkegaard then marx and everybody else read literature and engage with its complexity not with any single interpretation talk to real people laugh at things write pick up a form of physical creative expression music painting woodworking etc exercise too do as much as you possibly can to engage with the best parts of your humanity dont live jealously or selfcritically    im assuming that by redpilled youre talking /pol/ shit and not just the runofthemill disillusionment that comes with gaining a philosophical hermeneutic that tells you just how fucked everything is if you are talking about the latter then no there really isnt a way to come back from that without giving up and living ignorantly youll make peace with it if you live long enough

     these two have it right you are too deep into pol culture im sure that when emo kids from the early 2000s started growing up and meeting people outside their echo chamber they realized they looked and sounded retarded and had the same issue
  try to swallow the reality pill its one step beyond the redpill when you know that you are like one tiny little ant floating in a tiny little ball in space and nothing whatever you do matters then suddenly everything gets better you stop to see yourself and people in terms of us vs them any political stance lose any power over your persona and suddenly you are free to make you own thoughts and your own way without the fear of being wrong words like aryan sub saharan african semitic and the inherent tribalism haplogroups can bring lose any meaning you start to think and see people in terms of logicalmathematical intelligence and the fitness biology they display and the benefits this can bring overall it looks like whatever you do works with reality instead of trying to work with preconceived ideals and life gets easier and therefore way more better
  they pretend to be christian be fruitful and multiply types though because they think it runs counter to mainstream culture

  10 steps ahead towards being bluepilled    theres a reason all the great men of history were celibate or at least bachelors
  i did the psychiatric thing now im subjected to what seems to be a crippling egotism and a slowed mind however the thoughts of societal taint and destruction are still persistent marijuana acted as a determining factor of my psychosis for once i saw the means by which society truly operated the medications helped to bring me down either from thinking more acutely or from not thinking properly at all i suspect the former of course since medications are an enforcement of biopower in the world organism     i wish i could smoke weed i wish i could play videogames and watch cartoons pornography helps me to forget sometimes and allows me to become further entrenched in the machine it after all coopts ones sexuality and causes one to become weak in mind and spirit but the further i go along the more i realize and become more attentive to my own weakness i know there must be more to live for i know there has to be a way out but its still hard to find
  easier life is better thats pretty counter intuitive to a european mind are you jewish by any chance asking for a friend
  i know there must be more to live for  why because that would be pleasant    there can also be great relief in forgoing wishful thinking and stopping to think about existence as some friendly and orderly thing in which humans can live happy and meaningful lives and just resign to thinking of yourself as a meatpuppet with consciousness as a thermostat in charge of not letting the suffering get too bad until you die life can become almost agreeable if youre not constantly demanding it to be more than it is just feed yourself and learn to sleep well and try not to be too bored during your waking hours
  the biblel
  yeah im whatever floats your boat m8
  just do the leap of faith and pick up any scripture the rest follows from there
  no there has to be more there is always more literature and philosophy to read always more people to talk to always new places to see and experience the world though filled with hate and vitriol is also filled with love beauty and wonderful art but i have to concede on one pointthe idea to not demand to understand that life is fleeting and to stake out a little piece of ground which one can escape from any pain and to make it as beautiful a place as possibly can be
  all the great men of history had wives or at least fought for women lel
  however miserable i am now its nothing compared to the misery of having successful normie lives rubbed in your face everyday on social media no thanks
  no there has to be more there is always more literature and philosophy to read always more people to talk to always new places to see and experience  often these things make life worse though especially chasing after them and requiring constant novelty    its best to be content with as little as possible i think

  i was bluepilled until i became a 30yo boomer as in i was a liberal and i believed permanent liberation and transgression were leading to something even though i was never a rebel because i never hated anybody    also how is being edgy not mainstream and bluepilled except for being edgy about a few special topics that are untouchable everything else is encouraged to be trampled and mocked      i am not pol but i understand what pol is reacting to even though i think most of their solutions are deadends

  sure learn to be content with as little as possible thats fine but the idea that a man can live without any novelty or anything worthwhile to do is absurd even if all youve staked out in life is a patch of wood in an apartment building and a gaming pc youre still craving new things in the form of videogamesyou cant play the same ones forever and besides that youll never surpass a base level of suffering if all you do is play vidya browse 4chan and wageslave your way to the grave there are other experiences worth having thatll also induce suffering much more suffering but you get more happiness in turn its part of what makes us human

    take heart it is good that mankind will be extinguished and your own eventual death will come as a sweet release
  if time and space are the form into which objects are placed and sensation is what supplies the data for these objects then what is the form of sensation       schopenhauer is ambiguous on this actually he does not explain how if man is extinguished the will being thing in itself will also be extinguished since the will is a unity the perishing of individuals should not affect it how then nirvana is possible that is the extinction of the will schopenhauer cannot explain
  he was but the kicker is if you follow his philosophy you probably wont have a great quality of life
  whats your standard of measurement for quality of life
reading  the ultimate spectator sport  /vr/ here hi how do you make reading more interactive and challenging its so easy you just read the words and thats it unless the writer is awful and incoherent like kant or proust but thats just artificial difficulty
try thinking about what you read it should be challenging enough for you
read books that arent entertaining and actually require you to reread portions frequently contemplate take notes or apply the knowledge like a book about carpentry for example if you just read a book verbatim you wont really comprehend anything more than reading a simple summery after a few weeks even worse for audio books anyone who brags about reading hundreds of books is like a guy bragging about knowing a thousand punches
  he thinks learning how to read is easy    you will never be fit for the next meeting of minds if you continue like that
reading a book is like beating arcade mode understanding a book is like competing at a world level
read the complete works of plato and aristotle
wtf
awful writer  proust   worst baitpost ive ever seen
tfw some high school kid took all my joyce hiscores at the local library
  lets compare reading to vidya for the sake of metaphor  a you just read the words and thats it is similar to playing the singleplayer campaign without spending time doing side quests collectables and finding easter eggs perhaps even skipping cutscenes  so how to make the game more interesting well you could do coop aka start a reading group talk about the book read at the same pace etc it forces you to analyze more closely what youre reading and actually is a fun social experience  also how would you be a completionist while reading by complementing your reading with secondary sources online find references to other books and events read about the history of the writer delve into the themes of the book bring the book into context of the time it was written and by whom see what influences the book had etc    some books are full of references metaphors themes etc that you can almost never get exhausted with researching it and some books are more shallow light or fun reading groups and reading communities like /lit/ really can enhance the experience but dont burden yourself you should try to find joy in what your reading unless youre a compulsive completionist that forces himself to get full platinum on books me
kant and proust  artificial difficulty  git gud filthy casual
tfw realised that proper grammar is merely a social construct and i only restrict my genius by following the made up rules of correct syntax

  im groundbreaking yo imma revolutionize language mah niggas
      why the racism
its a question of stylistic quality more than merely one of correction    you can break rules all you like youll just come across as a mouthbreathing prole unless you actually know what youre doing you dont
  op is a nigger
  thats the point dipshit i fucking hate you and think youre a pretentious twat thats more invested in maintenance of a festering corpse which should be put out of its misery by force and ill do it so that it burns inside your souls with a thousand thankyous for ugly ruinous beauty hahahahahahahahaha
  sure thing prole
  make up your own language too you fucking retard
  why not
  the rules of grammar exist so others can understand you lets say you really are the smartest person in the universe do you want other people to recognize that fact by following the rules or do you just want to be seen as a gibbering drunk fucktard
  but grammar as a subset of language is communicative by nature anon if your subject finds it hard to understand your ebonics then your writing loses all its value   the most groundbreaking thinkers in any field dont outright reject proper form they evaluate it and adhere to it til they gain the clout to influence convention according to their will
  proper grammar is class oppression
  proper grammar is class oppression  broke    proper grammar is iq chauvinism thus implicitly racist sexist classist ageist and ableist and thats a good thing  woke

  i can see itits beautiful
language is merely a social construct that doesnt mean its made up following the rules will help you be understood
  i know whatthat you dont on grammar and its rules its a game a playset a place for my tile of words to be layed down and fit snuggly in the pass of lucidity liqued virtue lined by the silver graces of rules but with a punk attitude fuck the system bend the fools twist their thoughts wrap it around and back again you need a system that loops one two two one two then play with the pattern one two one two one one two show them something new three

are you a panster of a plotter when you write lit
wtf does that even mean
  do you plan your writing or do you create plot as you go
  of course you plan an outline even if its vague anyone who doesnt do this is actually hopelessly retarded or if successful just dumblucky
  what about the creative process writing in the moment
  not a real thing its just brainstorming which will require editing according to what whether you realize it or not is a developing outline
  this writing in the context of actually creating readable woks is really just editing

best critic of liberal democracy will never be mainstream because of a little nazi flirting    disgrace
  ive read dictatorship and got bored should i bother with concept of the political i want to read him before yockey
  depends why you got bored
  tfw national socialism is more democratic than liberal democracy
  im 40 pages into the concept of the political and ive marked almost everything
  the first few chapters were interesting but then it started with bodin and article 48 i lost interest    the friend/enemy dichotomy seems more interesting
btfo of schmitt in his own book    hehnothing personnel schmitty
  cringe and jewpilled

  the concept of the political expands on the friend/enemy distinction    i recommend the second edition    its pretty much necessary to get into agamben if you are interest in him
  agamben has a lot of books    any recs
  this man is dangerous  you said it this man has no thoughts but on rare occasion bad thoughts come to him

  there was an icon right below the results like in  it doesnt seem give one to every result
  get that egoism higher with some stirner nihilism is high enough for that already
  just spitballing but the materialism idealism and hedonism sound like neetchee with his eternal recurrence stuff trying to live the best life we can in this material world also he could certainly be considered a romantic so the higher romanticism certainly could factor into it the higher nihilism score obviously flies i the face of nietzsche but then again its some test you took online
what should i read also by the way it called me an objectivist but i consider myself something of a communist a weird communist

i suppose i should finally get around to reading the stoics
  read kant once
  faggot
  ive never worked a day in my life
egoism/altruism and idealism/pragmatism feel right could probably bump rationalism a couple of points have no clue what absolutism is in this context tho    recs
  i believe absolutism here implies faith in absolute reality or truth this could be faith in a religious doctrine or the material world/science

  oh yeah
it tells me im a stoic but im more of a hegesian desu pretty shitty questions with a lot of false dichotomies     the combination of ascetic nihilism does sort of tickle me tbqhwutbht
  based monk
im more egotistical honestly
cant get an image but    materialism vs spiritualism  227773  egoism vs altruism  433567  idealism vs pragmatism  478522  hedonism vs asceticism  357643  nihilism vs moralism  410590  rationalism vs romanticism  293707  skepticism vs absolutism  438563      materialists are everything wrong with this world
rather central
there is a part of me that hates that im so middle of the road i think there were to many questions in this test that said something like you believe ____ and ____ are good/ bad to which i had to reply neutral for example you believe that it is wrong to allow your life to be dictated by passion and fear or something similar was on there to which i replied neutral because i think that when we follow our passions we tend to do the best work and are less miserable doing it however when we are afraid it is usually due to some preconceived notion of the outcome which is usually false which can keep us from doing something worth while or find some new thing that we enjoy so yes to passion and no to fear
i prefer friendships that help me grow as a person as opposed to ones that are exciting  the fuck is that supposed to mean  if a friendship helps me grow as a person isnt that exciting  and how can a friendship be truly exciting if i it doesnt engage me on a deeper level    is this some kind of extrovert social butterfly logic that i am unable to comprehend
  same
  thats another one i was forced to reply neutral to you can easily have both
my altruism is way too high desu  my spirituality is also a little bit too much
apparently im nietzschean agree and rousseauian not sure about that    also glad to see stirner featured so prominently in the test did /leftypol/ really manage to meme him out of obscurity
  its a normie test like getting an expensive car vs saving a starving child i choose the car not because i want it but because the child is better off dead
  i hate tests like these because theres no room for subtlety nonetheless r8 me faggots
platonism/humanism hmm
  but expensive car vs starving child is a good question and there are many edgy life is suffering question in there too  the friendship question just seems paradoxical i dont know how anyone could answer anything other than i dont know
  choose the expensive car then drive the starving kid to mcdonalds

    save yourself for the next one anon
    im hoping this will be more extreme in 10 years gotta up that moralism
am i a normie
hit me with them recs
  what books should i read
  forgot image
so am i fucked up
i dont think many of these are true because i disagreed with the fundemental basis of the question to begin with i dont believe in the concept of we that is used in many of them    perfect balance on rationality and romanticism  wtf does this make me
recommend me something frens
in practice i think im much more of an egoist       gross    interesting
what you say /lit/
i expected more extreme results in some categories but all in all its an ok test thoughts my dudes
as others have pointed out this is really hard because of how loaded many of the questions are i answered neutral/i dont know to like half of them
  youll get there
where does it say what you are didnt call me anything
called a platonist  hate plato   what does this mean also im monotheist even though i dont really believe in god
  yeah this test is kinda butt a lot of the questions at least for me needed a lot more nuanced answers then simply agree disagree and the like
what should i read
pretty plain desu
  my diary
  983 moralism
i hate these meme tests
where do i lie
  how to take a screenshot
what do you think should i read any author or book in particular
need recs or be pointed toward a similar post with recs

  i could use some recs not well read in philosophy imo
  sorry on mobile this is me
i read stirner once also im a stem major      tolstoy
who should i read cucks
what should i read /lit/ base on what i got
  tolstoi
  you need to balance out all the excessess/deficiencies who do you think you should read to do that
  thats because you never have thought of these ideas critically
  i dont know thats why im asking
    kierkegaard
got nietzscheian and rousseauian i dont believe that human beings are good by nature nor am i a moral relativist but i do think that seeking usefulness and rational explanations is what ultimately leads people to ignore their search for joy and avoidance of pain for all focusing instead on measly ideals like progress and magnificence  i probably agree with mills utilitarianism the most but i feel like its too restrained

  do some research on your own and stop being lazy look up things that you think have to do with a subject matter find the people involved and look into their philosophies or the philosophies of their contemporaries reseach the ones who influenced them and use your own brain to stitch information together rather than relying on another anon to spoonfeed you
  communist
  no dude i fucking hate the commies what makes you think that     seriously fuck pinkos
  do you actually hate communism or do you just hate discord trannies who post anime communism meme shit
oi
mmmmm
  i think a healthy hatred of commies always starts with the ridiculous cultural manifestations but the intellectual communists are just as silly to me even though i have close friends in that world i legitimately enjoy reading some of them but believe all economic systems and their ephemeral philosophical extensions/ implications are also flawed dogma in general is disgusting to me and that includes economic dogmatists     you can see how low my morality is which leads to alienation and a desire to be spiritual and to rise above into a new sphere of consciousness but ive never even come close to feeling spiritual basically celine was right im curious why you would ask if im communist i may have been in another life but cis white males are no longer allowed intellectual autonomy so im at a point of rejection of all the bullshit a sort of nomans land full of bitterness and despair and laughter at the absurdity of it all

dont completely understand what this means about me hedonism is gross though
  nihilism altruism materialism and rationalismmaybe seems like communist combo
im noticing a connection of spirituality and egoism
  im a complicated man
  not him  i completely agree with your stance on communism and i think the way you wrote it here was well written however i cannot stand for your nihilism i implore you to consider that all value may be intrinsic  who cares what the universe thinks you are your own universe and you exist in conjunctions with other independent universes if that makes any sense  every second is a gift best spent having acknowledged but not worrying over the lack of seconds forthcoming    that being said i am a brainlet who doesnt read much philosophy who is celine and what did he say on the matter
              big brains
  i dont disagree with you that my feelings on nihilism are a bad thing its more of a circumstancial state of being than anything i manifested myself its not a good way to be alive but i have trouble believing theres intrinsic value in anything but i wish i could see things that way my reference to celine in fact was that he sees the world as a state of suffering while also acknowledging nihilism is weak i can see that but im too untethered and weak to do anything about it
  
78 hedonism  anyone wanna party
  most of these questions should be rewritten as i think that or i believe that rather than we should or worded as objective statements theres a difference between i believe a god exists and a god exists    also most of these dichotomies arent necessarily exclusive asceticism can be used for hedonism and altruism for egoism
  are you me
the link to the test doesnt work for me
  maybe   are you also a 30 year old who has lost his youthful ambitions has a shitty but healthy job 10/24 6/7 and spends almost all his free time reading greek/roman classics because its what remains of his inner self
  strong nihilism and skepticism
you need more balance friends    inb4 filthy phoneposter
these results  pathetic
  this the test detected that im an objectivist well enough  objectivism hobbesian  but i should in fact be fully into the absolutism side not skepticism  contextuality is important and was forced many times to simply answer neutral/i dont know
  my nigga
  90 materialism  100 egoism  75 idealism  75 hedonism  100 moralism  50 rationalism/romanticism  100 absolutism   is peak performance friend

rationalism/romanticism  should be instead made into rationalism/empiricism and naturalism/romanticism
whats something i should read

  sorry to hear about your diagnosis
  oh you 
i dont know how to respond to this
  hate the names of the categories
now what
  killing communists should not only be allowed but encouraged
funny thing is that im not religious
what do i read
am i gonna make it
the questions were short general and meaningless i had no chance of really engaging with the test as there were questions that were up to intuition instead of comprehensive analysis so i ended up being split on most of them on account of the generality     is consciousness immaterial  oh please no one who respects problems like these can answer in such a simple manner as the question was asked in these short shallow internet tests dont really do it justice
just the name dichotomy tests tells us of the real value of this test
i would say that im a bit more idealistic appart from that any recs
dont know what i should get from this post reccs though if u think of it

they dont really smell

    is that curry it has the must the pungency high notes of sweat some fresh some sunk into the must a little older politely bacterial and maybe burritos what is that last bit i need to say a cheap refried bean burrito
  it smells better than yours
  theres a white flakey crust that accumulates at the point where my perineum meets my nutsack that smells like mozzarella cheese
  salty hot and lowlying like syracuse in the summer
  like a turd covered in puke in humid tropical weather
  smells of rubber sweat and hard work i am a basketball coach
his gravestone reads dont try a phrase which bukowski uses in one of his poems advising aspiring writers and poets about inspiration and creativity bukowski explained the phrase in a 1963 letter to john william corrington somebody at one of these places  asked me what do you do how do you write create you dont i told them you dont try thats very important not to try either for cadillacs creation or immortality you wait and if nothing happens you wait some more its like a bug high on the wall you wait for it to come to you when it gets close enough you reach out slap out and kill it or if you like its looks you make a pet out of it    well /lit/ was he right ive written 56 pages of a novel in one go several times in sudden fits of resolution only to abandon them again what is your process will i ever finish anything    inb4 it doesnt even matter no one will ever read it   social recognition shouldnt be the reason for writing
i write songs poetry short stories videos and recently have been trying my hand at essays  i agree with bukowskis method when it comes to inspiration but make sure to have multiple outlets and a project for each at once so inspiration/creativity can strike more often without forcing it or waiting for months hopefully this can result in finishing all them nearly at once to their best quality
i think youre either productive or youre not there is a clear divide between those who make it and those who dont and its not just about writing but life in general
  dont you lose the red thread of a project you were working on when you leave it for a longer period of time
  i make sure to always edit practice or research for projects that are on hold to avoid that if i have to take a break for inspiration
    as far as aesthetic pursuits go i think he is right     often when you try you end up either straight up mimicking various points of influence you have funneled into some also very mimetic scheme you wish to put on paper this can not really be escaped but it seems that when inspiration strikes you all these impressions exaggerate into something novel something you have to express in some way before it fades away a borderline unconscious and unintentional method needs to emerge and be recognized in its totality only in retrospect some of the most novel and poetic things i have heard was from people in states of trance or near unconscious states it is no surprise that drugs fueled a lot of novel work    social recognition shouldnt be the reason for writing    why its almost always present even if its not a primary motive it remains still as an inherent part of publication i think that fixed thoughts like this just make things worse for when you try to write it seems at least in my experience to always remain there as a point of reference influencing your writing diminishing it through subtle control
just make shit until it becomes routine at that point that beginners problem will most likely be gone    as it really is just a beginners problem if you wait all the time youll always have it and when that inspiration comes youll be inexperienced and shit at writing    so its absolute garbage advice if you dont want to be a writer or dont have what it takes youll drop writing soon enough
  why its almost always present even if its not a primary motive it remains still as an inherent part of publication i think that fixed thoughts like this just make things worse for when you try to write it seems at least in my experience to always remain there as a point of reference influencing your writing diminishing it through subtle control    i dont disagree that its almost always present but for that very reason you shouldnt give a shit about recognition to truly create art this board is filled with pretentious losers that have some strange fantasy that writing the next ulysses will make them one of the cool kids writing should in my opinion be the product intrinsic motivators not dreams of arthoes and other vermin        unironically great advice halfdan rasmussen danish canon always said that writing was an 95 job just like any other and requires the same amount of time and effort
  you sound like a piece of shit man
  never mind what anyone else says just ask yrself do yot want to be a writer or do you want to write
  nice
  if you dont have talent if you werent born garcía márquez or faulkner hard work is all you got
  work on that novel nobody is to suddenly going to finish it for ya fuck bukowski fuck his fans
  this is not industrial though its artistry the were authors who worked hard and authors who didnt and like  said if you didnt win the genetic lottery hard work is all thats left for you
  you wait  i feel like this is pretty ambiguous if by wait he means write even if youre not particularly inspired then hes probably right in my estimation but i dont think thats what he means every single burst of inspired goodness ive had has come while ive had a regular habit of writing     gotta stand on top of a mountain if you ever want to get struck by lightning
  there are pleanty of examples of industrial artistry tho
  motivation is for weak willed man all you need is a routine and dicipline
amazon bent the cover  again
amazon sells books
  it started by selling books

hey foks im looking to get into traditionalism what are some good reads on this subject
ride the tiger
  my diary desu
im going to be leaving the country for 3 years maybe more    should i go to the library and borrow a whole stack of books to take and never return    if so what books whats the risk my taxes did fund the purchase of these books after all
  the library will eventually sell what you owe to a debt collection agency who will find if you ever return to the country
  reallywhats the max possible fine    surely it cant be larger than the price of a book
  he doesnt know about library death squads  oh anon
  funny how god never revealed himself to einstein huh
  deadly stuff
  when that video comes reality they will be rounding up copies of the bell curve and everyone will cheer when that altright kid gets smacked down
  he didnt actually get smacked down those are actors
  nice conspiracy theory faggot take it to the alex jones fanclub
  i like this future where we eliminate the people who read shit
  youd be surprised if it goes to collection it will trash your credit too  
  just buy your own damn books asshole yes your taxes funded the purchase of the books so did everyone elses taxes so why should you be the only one who gets to keep the book how would you like it if everyone else took a stack of ten books and never returned them arent they then stealing from you i cant believe you really cant see past your own navel you are why america is going to fall
  crybaby
    im actually in australia so
  god abandoned the jews a long time ago
  i would no more rather see your country rot than mine just pay for the books you read its the right thing to do
  ever heard of job
  yes that was a very long time ago
  abraham kleinman says no mr kleinman a lawyer from uniondale ny represented a queens man who sued unique management services for reporting his 295 late bill from the queens library system to credit bureaus the man rabbi avrohom sebrow won a settlement on a technicality  uniques license to operate in new york state had lapsed when it reported him  but mr kleinman is still angry about the tactic that was used against his client  rabbi avroham  every fucking time i swear
  jej
  thats not how taxes work you big dummy what you pay into does not become your property and you never get to claim it as your own it belongs to the public    borrow  and never return    thats not borrowing its theft go steal a gideon bible and read that for three years    9/10 bait good job i mad

no
only if you get a bilingual edition
any balzacians here im starting with pere goriot anyone else dived deeper into his oeuvre thoughts on him
balzac is said to have lost a novel every time he ejaculated and drank upwards of 20 cups of coffee a day
  and he actually consumed raw coffee grains like he ate them
  based and redpilled  gotta max that concentration of cafestol
been reading an old biography of balzac by zweig the man was a legend he pretended to be an aristocratic hard enough until he actually became one
hes great never read a bad novel by him albeit like 70 of his body of work is not translated into english so maybe ive just read the cream of the crop lost illusions is great and le peau chagrin i really enjoyed like poe but novel length and french and better
gobseck is underrated lost illusions is mandatory reading for any aspiring writer/artist
never read anything by him but i think i got the gist from playing with these
  pere goriot    i read this as part of a french history class it was alright but i wouldnt read more of his work the style and subject matter just doesnt interest me much     we also read a turn of the century novel about a french guy who goes to north africa and has sex with the local native boys but i cant remember the name does anyone know what im talking about it had a name like the illusionist but it obviously wasnt that
    the immoralist
  yes thats the one thank you from what i remember that book was interesting but again not my cup of tea
  19th century realists are the best and what i aspire to as a writer    balzac  flaubert  maupassant  dostoevsky  tolstoy  chekhov  james  zola  proust later but still realist    thats what my parnassus would be a modern writer who synthesized those influences into something for the modern era would be a dream
  the ending of pere goriot with goriots rambling monologue from his bed is one of the most emotionally affecting things ive ever read i can understand why some would say that balzac can be melodramatic but he is absolutely phenomenal at his best check out the skin of sorrow or lost illusions next       i would not call proust a realist author at all realistic settings sure but he was a part of the modernism movement
  what is realism and what is modernism exactly anyway
  if he wont honor my balzac i wont honor his
  drinks 30 cups of coffee  jerks off right up to the point before orgasm and stops    ahh yes time to write
only have lost illusions on my shelf good place to start with his works i understand he does a similar thing zola did where a lot of his characters are in some way connected or referenced in very subtle ways that only a more serious fan would pick up on
  lick my balzac
what do i need to read before i read sartre
  not much a general view of traditional philosophy metaphysics can help spotting the main issues he tries to address but in terms of literature you dont need anything specific
drink bleach
spend a long time sniffing your own farts so you can get into the authors state of mind
i had as well a tendency to fetishize hot women posing as intellectualslike porn actresses with glasses or models posing naked while staring at open booksbut then i realized it was just a façade to mask my instinctive desire for simple intense and loud pounding of pussy with as much moaning and cumming as possible and my deeper and quieter need for company and understanding
    in my asshole where he can be found we cant ask of jbs too see clearly or to explain himself simply jbs it seems has nevertheless foreseen the solitude and obscurity of my anusjbs obviously is talking about himself when he writes on page 451 this man fears every kind of solitude that of the genius as well as that of the assassin lets understand what this meansbased on the weeklies jbs only sees himself in the skin of a genius for my part and based on his texts i am forced to see jbs only in the skin of an assassin and even more of a fucking police informant cursed hideous a pain in the ass rumor monger a donkey in glasses here i am getting carried away its not appropriate for my age or condition i was going to close heredisgusted thats alli think it overassassin and brilliant weve seen this beforeafter allmaybe thats the case with sartre an assassin he is he wants to be one thats understood but brilliant brilliant tiny turd of my ass  hmmmthat remains to be seenyes to be sure that could blossommake itself knownbut jbs his embryo eyes his mean and petty shoulders that fat little gut and philosopherthat add up to a lot of thingsit seems he freed paris on bicycle he played around at the theater the city 1 with the horrors of the era the war torture irons fire but times change and there he is growing swelling up enormously jbs he cant control himself anymorehe no longer knows himselffrom the embryo he is hes becoming a creaturethe cyclehes had enough of toys cheatinghes running after ordeals real ordealsprisonexpiation the stick and the biggest of all sticks the stake jbs becomes destiny the furies no more bagatelles he wants to become a true monster now hes yelling at de gaulle
  i want her to tell me i dont deserve her vagina or deserve to touch her or see her naked then i want her to hit my bare balls while they are completely exposed and tied up so i can feel the pain shoot right up into my stomach  id like for her to sit down while i kneel less effort for her and just as much pain for me id be so happy she spent what little time she could spare trying to make me infertile and causing me severe pain even a chance at lifelong debilitating pain if i get testicular torsion she will look at my swollen bruised scrotum and laugh at how she can already see the immediate signs of my quality of life being lowered right in front of her by damage she caused    if im lucky she might let me savour the taste of her spit and tell me how entertaining its been making me hurt so much and not do anything to stop her begging her to kick me harder with watery eyes and not stopping until i could no longer get an erection
jezebel  sartre   cringe  slave and fleshpilled
  hegel  kojève  heidegger    then proceed not to read sartre
and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat    r e n o u n c e  e  n  o  u  n  c  e
shes going to get that book wet
  nothing sartre you can start with
  nothing but dont bother   read camus hes entry level but actually good
heidegger  husserl   the bible and moby dick
    most anons on this thread will have read the novels and maybe existentialism is a humanism do not do not read existentialism is a humanism under any circumstances read his essay on husserls intentionality first then the sketch for a theory of the emotions     then read being and nothingness but with secondary literature available catalanos book length analysis/readers guide is the best work out there a lot of tryhards will shit on mcculloch now but hes very accessible and will see you to a better understanding than anyone on this board is likely to have     webber is more modern and popular but if you understand the system as a whole you will take a long time to realize how subtly yet grossly he goes wrong    seriously though do not read existentialism is a humanism        t an idiot who has never seriously tried to analyze either sartre or camus but wants cred on an alexandrian acrostic scribing board
  this   but id say read the allegory of the cave and the purple bibles section on plato  aristotle that could be done in a boring afternoon so yeah not much
  purple bible
this nigga looked two ways at once
  whats so awful about existentialism is a humanism
  what do i need to read before i read sartre    the iliad  the odyssey  the works of plato  the bible including apocrypha  the works of cicero  the works of seneca  taipei by tao lin  meditations  the wealth of nations  the tibetan book of the dead  the works of nietzsche  the works of shakespeare  augustines confessions  tolstoys confessions  12 rules for life by jordan peterson  beowulf  the fucking sticky  the works of machiavelli  das kapital  ulysses  the witches by roald dahl
  stop at 12 rules of life it is the best book ever written
  implying that isnt superior to looking in one direction only    it was so sartre could look out his window watching all the people listening to him fuck while he could watch beauvoir with the other
  just read the nausea
    imagine you spend years working on a grand system you get asked by a group of bourgeois middlebrows to give a talk on the subject so you write the cliffs notes version with plenty of inaccuracies because they wont notice and it doesnt matter anyway    you give the talk and fend off some inane questions someone was taking notes soon someone wants there to be a pamphlet published of the talk you agree because itll sell 200 copies at most to people in the room and get buried    middlebrow readers get it in droves and you later call it a mistake in an interview people forget that and take it along with your novels to be your thought ignoring your better nonfiction works     70 years later people on a kowloon walled city dentistry forum routinely shit on you and say camus is better because they read the pamphlet and your edgier and more accessible novels    thats existentialism is a humanism
why is this board obsessed with reading 15 books before starting the main book theyre interested in open the book youre interested in and read it
  nietzsche is notorious for being misread easily

  there is no confession its hard to accept but it is what it is everyone hearing your advice are funnelling it through multiple perspectives that it becomes impersonal when it reaches them  my advice pick something a hobby where you can witness your own improvement and spend a lot of time in it it doesnt matter how ridiculously hard it is to master eg piano  just do it audiences will come even if its to learn how to mimic you
  good luck with that studio in a town of 40000 youd probably have better luck with that at college or in a big cultural center like nyc
happy holidays anons i hope you get everything on your wish lists and have a warm holiday season you guys are the best friends that i have

i dont really know how to specify further so here it goes  itt post your ideas on personal journals and the best way to make/maintain them  paper  digital  mails  voice recording  online  offline  encrypte  share your wisdom and personal preferences when writing your diary/notes etc i searched but saldy there isnt much on the internet about digital diary writing beyond superficial articles i want to talk to actual people who are doing this kind of stuff  my goal it to write a journal and i want to do it digitally as i feel paper isnt secure enough feel free to suggest all options though and how you use them in further detail  for me something like rednotebook comes to mind  but its kinda sucky since it isnt that easy to link stuff and the tagging/word cloud no longer works the other problem is that the previewmode is broken for windont  do you lads have any reccomendations for journalling  share your ideas on it here
how much traffic does this board get  should i have posted this elsewhere  in that case  forgive me its my first post on this board
i write mine in a notebook the old fashioned way i dont really care that much if someone peeks into it theyll just find a lot of complaints about work procedures and reminiscences of things that happened ten years ago a lot of people cant read cursive anymore because its not taught in schools so in a way its selfencrypted
  i can only read cursive if its perfect cursive i usually cant deal with cursive  whatever personal deviations the writer has when writing in cursive
  if you start writing in cursive you will have no problem reading your own
  haha nice what kind of handwriting style do you use  any specific typography or however you call the style of the font  perhaps i am too paranoid but security through obscurity is not security  that all aside digital provides a way to preserve the contents for later reflections and it can be expanded later as well so i was tossing around the idea of using a scanner and just archiving all pages every week/month depending on the sensitivity of the content and otherwise just use paper and not give a damn about writing on a keyboard it could be done with rednotebook for some reason i really like the program since its foss and its features might expand in the future and it doesnt lock me in      welp they used to teach cursive in school and it looks nice but the unromantic reality is that normal lettering is less prone to error
  thats like a person saying they dont need free speech because they have nothing to say
  what does shekelpiro have to do with privacy concerns  that aside this thread is about journaling i am deleting the post to not further derail  do you keep a journal anon
most of the people here are npcs
  okay but how do you keep your journal
    my handwriting is really sloppy scrawl basically if i write slowly and make an effort it can look nice but theres not much point when writing in my diary desu
  yeah as long as you can still read it  i am kinda weary but i think i will just toss up my hands and use rednotebook fug it there i can at least include all sorts of media and if i want i can just write on blank white pages and scan them every week or use a normal notebook for a few months and then just archive it all onto the program which doesnt lock me into a format and much rather allows to export as html pdf and raw text  does it sound reasonable or will it be too much effort to scan provided i type directly into the program most of the time

  how do you keep your diaries  fixed    but on to the topic written or digital the following should be on top     date   time   entry     i used to put titles so i know what i wanna talk about but lately i just let the pen flow
  i buy leather bound journals on etsy and when im done i mail them to people
i use journeycloud  i dont care if my shit is datamined its always the same posts about depression and suicide
  dollarstore pocket composition notebook  bullet journaling  my todolist and then a few sentences about the day and whatever other ideas i had that day on one or two pages every day its actually kind of cool having a new notebook every fiscal quarter
orgzly which you can download from fdroid repo is a new favorite of mine as far as digital methods go
  yeah i already did that when i still followed the habit but i was more worried about the technicalities  should i use rednotebook or rather a personal wiki or something entirely else  its a tossup i just cant decide i feel paralyzed      god this is embarassing      and when im done i mail them to people  wewlad  why though      yeah i heard of that service  how is it can you put in all sorts of digital media files pics vids mp3 and so on
  perhaps i should stop trying to go permanent or secure or digital and just do something like this but i cant commit ree      forgot to add  the same posts about depression and suicide  are you doing alright anon
  wewlad   why though    two reasons    1 im perennially homeless so i often have no way of holding on to them  2 i want other people to read them even when theyre often just schizo gibberish
  looking it up now
  oh sorry for your situation it must suck with winter coming along  if you want to share your story feel free to do so i will read it if you can bother to write it here
  im in hawaii and not presently homeless thankfully my story if you mean my life story is very long and stupid im not sure its worth sharing
  how is it can you put in all sorts of digital media files pics vids mp3 and so on  i only uploaded pictures so far but yeah looks like it its got a really clean interface and you can use it both via smartphone app and browser all the data is uploaded to your google drive theres no separate account      are you doing alright anon  thanks for asking i get by
  im in hawaii and not presently homeless thankfully my story if you mean my life story is very long and stupid im not sure its worth sharing  i am still pretty young and even though i am doing good or at least have good chances  just cant into uni rn i am pretty depressed  i bet i could still probably draw some inspiration from your story i of course understand if you cant be arsed to write it i dread it too sometimes its just so you know that my interest isnt the bottleneck
   all the data is uploaded to your google drive theres no separate account  sounds dystopian but also oh so convenient damnit you are seducing me man    thanks for asking i get by  feel free to talk more even if all i can do is listen you are probably from america so you might be used to the how are ya  fine routine i have my issues too if that soothes you a little
ive been using the simple notes app on my phone for years now it is simple effective and always available when i have a spare moment from there i transfer it to a master sheet on my pc this is usually updated every few months     though i find the idea of writing cursive in a leather backed journal this is not a practical option having the master diary available as opposed to several note books of illegible scribble has been rewarding
  feel free to talk more  i dont want to hijack the thread youve probably glazed over my rants in other threads already  thanks though kind anon
i use a small black notebook i title each entry with the date i color code what i write with different color pens pilot g2s are my favorite different colors for different tangents within the same entry
  it is my first time posting here so i havent  forgive me for i am a rancid homosexual of novel nature
  have you ever thought of going digital
i have poor handwriting and no ambition to improve it so that has been a huge problem for me as i dont want to have ugly notes i also do not like having unorganized notes which is a natural result when you are taking notes as they come to you i have a light obsession with notebooks and find their aesthetic very appealing but in practice i cannot find myself using them except for archival purposes once the thoughts are clear to me and i can organize them better as such i find myself moving towards digital solutions as i am a superior typist because its quicker and cleaner to create notes on the fly and then organize them afterward i previously mentioned orgzly which lets you create named notebooks and then you can create notes inside of those notebooks with various tags and labels you can use to organize them    i currently use samsung devices so s note is also pretty good when it comes to digital handwritten notes
  alright ultra short version    youth iq tested at 144 per the wais 999th percentile on the raven apm thought to have autism or adhd though mom didnt like those diagnoses shopped around and kept getting me diagnosed with new things from ages 816 even telling me what to say to the psychiatrists medication fucked me up instead of going to a gifted and talented program i ended up being sent to an alternative school where    adolescence i started to realize i was trans but not before the fundamentalist teachers/paras of the school i was attending did for which they subjected me to things that would be illegal to do to prisoners of war parents didnt care pretended not to know what was going on just wanted me to be normal at any cost went crazy was expelled enrolled in community college fucked around finally got off the meds thought the meds had made me trans so tried to be normal played dance games to distract myself and try to socialize but sucked at being social    adulthood came out as trans wound up homeless went back to community college accumulated 6 degrees while working towards a bachelors/racking up remedial credits brief period of alcoholism went on to regular college developed schizoaffective disorder heard a voice in my head i thought was a spirit couldnt think clearly anymore tried to get through school by cheating/malingering wound up getting expelled in senior year due to complications from mental illness student loans maxed out no jobs anywhere no friends or family went to europe to die but somehow survived despite or perhaps because of having a full blown psychotic break in germany lived in seattle for a year lived in hawaii for a year so far finally got a halfdecent job and a place to live still very nervous
  144 iq  unironically believes he is trans  homeless  lol quit lying to us and yourself
  iq 144  you lucky motherfucker  think i am trans  are you sure it wasnt meds that screwed you and perhaps combined with overanalysis and pathologization of your thoughtworld when your mom was shopping around for a diagnosis as onlooker it seems like a possibility to me  problems one has and works throug suddenly become illnesses that are not healed by attacking but by exploring just saying  degrees six 6  impressive to be honest  is it the same as studying in uni for three of more years so you actually were in higher education as a student for 12 years or am i conflating the system here in germany with what is done in america for education  finally got a halfdecent job  that is nice to hear  i think you can build from there even if it isnt what you initially imagined i just wish i could come to terms with perhaps never going to uni or only later  i am just a 121 its kinda like yearning for something you cant grab but not being able to grab anything else either for fear tha you will never get over not getting the previous physics bsc/msc in uni thing  still very nervous  i think that if you hold on just a little while longer you might just settle in at any rate  i wish you the best for your future even if it has been rough until now  did you let them cut you up down there yet  pls dont do it i do support the idea in general if it helps people deal with their perception but hearing reports like  disregard religious gloss for a second pls  its made for a russian audience      it can happen iq is a good indicator of future stability but there are exceptions
  well the medication alcoholism and schizoaffective took a chunk out of me so im now 122 with a verbal tilt verbal iq isnt effected by schizo also mtf have higher iqs as a population than even ashkenazi jews so i dont know what youre talking about
  are you sure it wasnt meds that screwed you and perhaps combined with overanalysis and pathologization of your thoughtworld when your mom was shopping around for a diagnosis as onlooker it seems like a possibility to me  problems one has and works throug suddenly become illnesses that are not healed by attacking but by exploring just saying    at this point if it were possible to beat i would have beaten it so i have to assume no    impressive to be honest  is it the same as studying in uni for three of more years so you actually were in higher education as a student for 12 years or am i conflating the system here in germany with what is done in america for education    there was a lot of overlap in credits i went roughly halftime to community college from 20042008 and full time from 20102016 so i guess 10 years    also definitely consider college just not stem find something you want to do that you can also be social through most of the benefit of college is signaling combined with networking
  at this point if it were possible to beat i would have beaten it so i have to assume no  okay how do you want to arrange with this rift of selfperception and body/physical reality i would need to somehow become more accepting of my situation too i guess  consider college but not stem  why though with a bsc or even msc in physics i can get to a very good position here in europe/germany alternatively i am considering just going into a ausbildung not sure if its called vocational school or trade and maybe study later or maybe i will get well again and just study next wintersemester and tackly physics again when i am healthy once more
  okay how do you want to arrange with this rift of selfperception and body/physical reality    i handle it by taking hormones and being a shutin mostly    and 120 iq is pretty low for physics im not saying its impossible by any means feynman was famously 125 but youre at a disadvantage relative to a lot of people who are going to be there so definitely dont do it unless its something you really love
  is it really true that the average for physics lies at 130  i heard there are different iq tests with varying scaling often having an offset of 10 or more points  so i am not sure if i should let this be the deciding factor  it is not that i am unable to understand concepts if i buckle down and study but i was just too depressed
  there are different iq tests thats true im not an expert on it 130 is what id heard also if you think you can do it and you want to do it go for it if depression is potentially crippling you may end up at the mercy of the effectiveness of psych drugs though or else your own condition this is a tough position to be in but you can always take longer than 4 years to get through a degree too
      tfw failed all my mathematics physics and chemistry classes in high school never understood shit  im actual brainlet is it possible for me to learn at least the basics
  sure grind khan academy every day you can definitely pick up the basics by doing that
  yeah though maybe doing a jobeducation or whatever is the proper systemic word for it in english might be better for me i guess the most important thing i learn is discipline but i have been told numerous times that it is simply illness that is making me the way i am  goddamnit you are right i am at the mercy of drugeffectiveness      you can learn the basics the thing with math is that you probably didnt pay attention for a few months and its a matter of the theories/applications/methods being based on one another  there are probably plenty of pdfs on the web of the textbooks your best bet is to probably just revisit them
  yeah i have i used to keep a digital diary but i just dont like using my notes app for that as much something about the act of physically writing out my days is cathartic to me
  yeah i am considering writescan for simply archiving but using paper as working memory only digitizing and discarding/destroying what is sensitive
  youre like a character from a bolano novel

why doesnt anyone mention this masterpiece attar was a genius     we seem to be having an eastern renaissance these days with chinese and indian literatute frequently discussed what about medieval islamic philosophy which contributed to the renaissance in no small manner

  yawn   read a book or two but i know you wont do that so heres a wikipedia article     
  bird parliament   incredible
  a convenient story for sure
  haha yeah thanks islam couldnt have done without you dabbing on causality since the 11th century    
  woops shouldve read the whole article         why does it have to be islam vs the west though surely wise men are worth listening to despite their religion or race this is just a thread about this beautiful sufi poem ive been reading and the replies are all shitting on islam i cant believe how arrogant some people are if you think there is nothing you can learn from islamic thought it just indicates how close minded and biased you are which is not a sign of intelligent well educated people

as the subject reads    ive recently started dating a girl who identifies as nonbinary and ive been thrust into this world of lgbt issues ive always been empathetic towards but never involved with enough to develop a thorough understanding knowledge of terminology etc with  are there any decent modern books that deal with these issues  its going pretty well and i dig her/them a lot but i feel so out of my depth
  why dont you just ask them
really glad i dont live in a large city
  deal with them at what level the popular cultural level or the deep theoretical underpinnings of the lgbt movement judith butler is pretty legit if youre familiar with derrida
  i have and while theyve said theyre willing to pull me up when im wrong teach me as we go along i dont want to put the entire crux of my education upon them    ideally both something that can give me both an understanding at the current popular level as well as the history thereof im somewhat familiar with derrida so ill have a look into butler cheers    yeah thems the breaks unfortunately
  so youre dating a man   gay
  thems the breaks
fucks calypso in all holes for 8 years  penelope expected to masturbate only on the assumption that he might be alive    why does /lit/ get so butthurt when john green calls the odyssey sexist the book was written almost 3000 years ago its not like its a shocking revelation that it would be sexist and theres still a lot about the story to enjoy in 2018 in spite of that
  meaningless term for testosterone deficient faggots like you
  women are children and must be treated as such
  because its fucking retarded to judge a 3000 year old poem by modern day social standards
  the patriarchal society depicted in homer is normalthe city states and kingsit has been that way since agriculture was invented up until recently
  sexism has nothing to do with it   odysseus paid for her she was his property she was his means of continuing his bloodline this was entirely normal and culturally appropriate guys could fuck whatever they liked as could whores wives were property
    its okay to judge and call it unfair
  calypso kept odysseus as her sex slave for years on end promising him immortality and eternal bliss odysseus rejected that
  calypso  she detained him the story is a metaphor for how sexual activity enslaves even the greatest of men and how one should strive for moderation and chastity
  the odyssey is undeniably sexist but literally who gives a shit sexism isnt bad
  john green relies on the emotions of 16 year old girls to make money degrading one of the most inspiring artistic achievements of human history by reducing it to mere identity politics is not something he cares about
  odysseus was literally calypsos sex slave couldnt leave her island all while under duress which under the modern definition is rape he also looked out to sea and cried every night thinking about penelope john green conveniently fails to mention any of this and is a giant disingenuous faggot
  because its fucking retarded to judge a 3000 year old poem by modern day social standards    you say that but when you look down at your 4 inch mutilated dick you rage uncontrollably at your father for being fooled by a jewish kabal into doing it some things are just self evident kiddo
  he also looked out to sea and cried every night thinking about penelope  he cried every night thinking about the fact that his great deeds would never be remembered because he might never return from sea  he cares about penelope because shes a good woman and adds honor to his name but hes not particularly loyal to her either he doesnt hesitate to shag every goddess he comes across
  weaving is a metaphor for masturbating guys ive figured it out now
  reads one of the most importants works of literature   focus his attention in banal things like sexuality   yep brainlets
  jesus christ how does john greene even still identify as a man
  weak bait op you have to step it up
  odysseus was raped by a deity for 8 years
  like who
mfw no calypso waifu
  banal things like sexuality   cringe ungreek attitude anaemic anglo

why do people even read books all this time staring at pages with lots of words on them have you even seen a book lots of wordsand people just sit there reading them so they can try and learn something the stuff they learn about is stupid old history or they read some dumb kids books so they can pretend they are anyone but themselveslearn from a book just go for a walk and look at stuff or talk to people and listen everything in a book is already outside
  nice digits man and i agree if i wasnt an incel id probably be out banging thots instead of reading some greek faggot that has been dead since thousands of years
  what did incels do before the internet and shit
  they just died alone without anyone noticing
  what a relief
  everything in a book is already outside  made me lol
  why did you write this post
  in reality whoever finds happiness with few regrets is the person who succeeded a long life brings more happiness if luck and fortune come along
  i dont care about happiness
how do modernist and postmodernist works of american literature contrast with their european counterparts of the same periods im taking a class on american literature on the ma level and my professor is obsessed with what is american about american literature which seems very meta and almost meaningless to me  read lolita  read american psycho  all i see in them that doesnt exist in european literature is consumerism and explicit degeneracy no
  huh i never imagined patrick bateman looking like that
i just read page 1 and half of page 2 it has failed already in page one the man walked outside and instead of describing outside properly or not describing outside at all it went on to describe his thoughts in this time reading about his thoughts my mind was creating an image of outside outside was cold like the end of autumn gloomy and empty in my mind and then page 2 describes it hot airless dusty and even bustle the complete opposite of the image i had been given too much time to build in my head 2 pages and one of the greatest books ever failed as a book hardly great when i dont want to read to the end of page 2 kane and able was a fantastic book yet doesnt come up in top lists the little prince was a great fun little book and doesnt come up in lists but this 2 page fail comes up in every list a book allows the reader to create a picture in their mind to then tear that picture up is a poor writer i dont care how many lists it is in if it cant be read it is rubbish
  i think you might be retarded
id love to read more of your 2 page in reviews
  i second this
  this is how autists actually read and analyze a book
what the fuck is this
  hahahahah
pretty sure the first paragraph describes the stifling heat of that st petersburg summer might even be the first line of the book     you have got to be fucking retarded
  it is op is a master baiter    the two translations i own read  in early july in exceptional heat  and  on an exceptionally hot evening early in july    i cant imagine any other translation omitting the information that its summer and its hot
  yup    first line of the constance garnett translation on an exceptionally hot evening early in july a young man came out of the garret in which he lodged in s place and walked slowly as if in hesitation towards k bridge
  lolol if you like the little prince you must like tolstoy lmao
  imagine liking tolstoy hahaha
which write better english    litetature and creative writing majors    or    advertising and journalists majors
bro how do my roommates always know when i finished fapping its like literally within 5 minutes of getting a nut off some mother fucker starts going up and down the hall or comes home or whatever i dont care about wackin off deal with it but like its making me paranoid how can they tell i cant figure it out man like would it be too insane to search for peepholes or usb cams or something and why the fuck would someone spy on me while i wack it what the fuck i just cant figure it out but its definitely no coincidence it happens 90 of the time
    it depends on which english major/creative writer and which journalist/advertiser each person is a person and we are all alone
i have no idea
  both share diferent goals is very diferent the english they teach you to write in lit degrees versus journalism    almost as diferent as teaching classical music versus modern styles
i just finished wackin it and as soon as i got up to piss some mother fucker came in the front door made a bunch of noise and then left right exactly when i got up from finishing fapping and since they came in from outside somehow they could tell when i finished from outside the house yo this is like a horror movie but instead of getting murdered by a serial killer im getting fap harassed that could be a sick story actually some evil priests who got around haunting people when they fap or some shit these are just random bro type dudes no religious nuts but u feel me
  advertisers    the key to good writing is being succinct and being concise is especially important in an age where ads have to be 5 seconds long     many english grads meanwhile head their head stuck up their ass and write a bunch of fluff because they believe theyre a genius
  based
  based
  which write better english  definitely not you thats for sure
  not fapping only and exclusively when youre alone for maximum privacy and relaxation
  yooo i have a theory i know one of the dudes gets shit from the landlord for being too loud right so in a classic case of whataboutism he probably told the landlord yo that other dude be wackin hours at a time sometimes wtf and he left today when usually he plays fortnite 1216 hours a day but he knew i would stroke when he left so the landlord was snooping around to see if its true well sorry wackin in it in my own room does not violate any kind of lease but making noise at 3am and having guests every night in fact does so fuck off    btw someone make a new whats on your mind thread so i can post my masturbatory travails there instead of here
  no but bro thats the thing i do it when im alone but then as soon as i start pumping nut someone will come in and slam the front door or run up the starts and chill in the hallway right outside what the fuck is going on man
  the goal of language is nothing but communication     el oh el
  many english grads meanwhile head their head stuck up their ass and write a bunch of fluff because they believe theyre a genius  can relate minus the genius part

  educationindustrial complex
im confused as to what media actually is by his definition at one point he starts talking about how media is an extension of the body and then goes on to dedicate an entire chapter to clothing as an extension of the skin but i do like his idea of hot and cold mediums
based
  i was assigned part of medium is the message for school and i it took me forever to parse what the fuck he was talking about if the medium is gay verbose confusing text then maybe i dont want to receive your message mr mcluhan
ok all fair but have your heard the album from 1965 or so fucking kino    
how the fuck does copyright law work for books i cant imagine ernest cline went to every single owner of every ip referenced in ready player one and made sure to get their ok before putting them in
  i havent read the book but im pretty sure its covered under fair use
  wil wheaton is mentioned by name and depicted as part of the upper management of some company
  youre allowed to use trademarked property under fair use but you cant major plot devices ie you can a gundam in your novel but you cant be basically writing a gundam book unless its disney/mickey mouse you will get sued no matter what
  reading ernesto bugman klein   yikes
this book was written by an autistic manchild with savant syndrome except his only talent is holding the attention of gamers by translating the appeal of video games to novel format it reads like a list of things the author liked as a kid and hasnt grown out of into his late 40s ernest cline truly is a master of appeal to children probably because it was the main selling point of every one of his hobbies for the duration of his life
  its like adornos fever dream desu
  have i become a crotchety old man at age 21 i read this and cringed reads like reddit vomited onto a page
  truly the 21st century eliot
reddit the book
  this reads like the power rangers fan fiction my aspergers neighbor would write in elementary school
  have you watched the movie its cringe the motion picture
  uses cringe as an adjective  you are literally not figuratively reddit
  t ernesto bugman clien trying to 4chan culture  someone get the fucking raid
  he doesnt know where cringe comes from  he actually thinks that saying cringe wasnt an ironic appropriation of reddit faggotry  he thought it was cool and not another case of chantards choking on their own bile
  
  do you even know what an adjective is
    man ernie is pissed   get fucked bugboy
    cringe crigne thrrads started on 4chan retard remember rage threads
the appeal of the book cant be just i saw thing and read it in this book i clapped there has to be something else surely
  reminder this entire diatribe comes less than 2 pages after he main character exains how physically impossible it would be for one human to absorb this much pop culture the entire story works better as the ravings of a madman whos brain melted because of this garbage
   it regurgitates geek culture back at the reader it makes the reader feel like the things they loved as kids mattered and is important its a story about a future where 80s pop culture is not only important but saves the day
the only dystopia more shallow than the one described in the novel ready player one is the one portrayed in the film ready player one
  transformative works are protected under fair use
  its palpable how much more the author enjoys writing the scenes in virtual reality than out of it its like watching a crack addict fiending for a hit in an empty gray apartment until he puts a lighter to a pipe and the main character says im goin in before putting on his bike helmet leading to an ensuing nod towards 2001s a space odysseys stargate sequence and plunging him into a world of sunshine rainbows and pants that fit its gamer methamphetamine in written form if there is anything redeemable to this story its the childlike wonder this grown man finds in writing and watching it all unfold right in front of you even if it makes it damn near impossible to separate the story from the author
  is it just me or does the author seem to be way less familiar with anime than any of the other categories it feels much less comprehensive in terms of nerd culture namedropping than the rest dude doesnt even mention evangelion which would pretty obviously be included in any actual list of significant moments for the medium
  please tell me this is not real
  apparently it gets name dropped later on    
  you can reference a name thats fine    the film does need to get approval because they are using the image not simply a written word
  this just feels like a selfinsert
  the whole book is to an animeesque degree
  i blame firstperson writing and present tense  its terrible how easy they are to mess up
  why would someone even write this didnt someone try to stop him
  this wasnt really messed up it was deliberate and the target audience enjoys it
  because it works  its rather easy to read and pats you on the back when/if you recognise a reference  i would compare it to the massproduced fantasy/ya books you can find in any library which are easy to read and to forget filled with stock phrases and tropes of the genre but those can be enjoyable if theyre written carefully rdp is just boring    he doesnt even reference warcraft starcraft diablo or anything outside of 80s which were absolutely awful in terms of culture if you stop memeing about it
the 80s was a long a decade ten whole years  has anything more meaningless been ever written
  even my gf cringed reading that and shes currently watching jenna marbles
  i watched a lot of youtube videos of cute geeky girls playing 80s cover tunes on ukuleles technically this wasnt part of my research but i had a serious cutegeekygirlsplayingukuleles fetish which i can neither explain nor defend  why would he include this its clear hes just talking about himself
  if you think thats bad check out his nerd porn auteur poem
  that was physically exhausting to read  how can you get through a whole book like this
  theres much worse
  orbiting each other like accelerated electrons  but electrons dont orbit each other
  one of the rare works of fiction that would benefit from degenerate eroticism
  its very clear the author knows very little about anything he brings up in the book  thats why all the references to stuff is literally just name dropping it with no further depth the guy knows jack shit
  transformative work no risk of people mistaking this for the original books/movies it references
  and of course kevin smith    makes me lose every time this is posted
  blue monday has a bpm of 130 whereas union of the snake has a bpm of 115 one would think his first thoughts would be that the duran duran song was pitched up significantly or that it was playing at a faster speed than normal given that it was being mixed into the much faster blue monday but apparently our whizzkid who has studied these songs 10 hours a day doesnt even notice pathetic
share your pynchon sighting stories in 2012 i passed a sidewalk cafe in manhattan where he was sitting alone he was reading a copy of howard zinns a peoples history of the united states his lips were moving as he read
i saw him in a cafe in the south island in new zealand in a cafe called lyttelton coffee co he was with several friends and he made a quip about how he looked like a certain american actor i cant remember who but i searched it at the time and they did kind of look alike
i saw him on the street in cayucas california a long time ago i remember briefly thinking about murdering him then and there i didnt seriously consider it it was like when youre standing on a cliff and you think about jumping off even though youre not suicidal i had a knife in my pocket at the time and i thought i could kill pynchon and become notorious he was walking with a black woman
i saw him in a dream once he floated in through the window and gave me the narrative arc for the greatest story ever told the next day i wrote what he told me to write in a flurry of inspiration unfortunately it couldnt be published it was deemed too close to scary movie 2
  in the summer of 2008 as i was walking through columbus indiana i spotted him standing inside the irwin union bank wearing a white bucket hat and a shirt with some sort of hawaiian floral pattern a young woman presumably an employee appeared to be trying to attract his attention but the slightly stooped pynchon didnt notice her he was frozen in front of a large window peering through a pair of oversized binoculars at something across the street i turned around to see what had so transfixed him and saw a curlyhaired woman in a third floor window across the street relaying some sort of message using hand signals when i turned around to look at pynchon again he was gone i walked inside the irwin union bank hoping to find him but all i found was a folded piece of paper on the ground where he had been standing i unfolded it hoping to find a note but nothing was written
saw him back in 1977 in monee illinois walked into a bar and he was sitting there with a dog propped up on the stool next to his didnt know who was at the time
  having been alive and aware of pynchons existence in 1977  you were born in at least 1957 how are you doing grandpa
saw him smoking a cigarette behind the restaurant i work at a few years back i was out for a cigarette myself and he approached me and offered me one of his he said they were lucky strikes from ww2 and i believed him we stood smoking in silence for a few minutes  he finished his stubbed it out on a rat corpse he turned to me and said well suppose id better get back to them dont work too hard ok and then climbed down an open manhole a few minutes later i heard gunshots
i saw him back in 2002 at a public library in a town called willimantic i swear it was him and he was sitting at one of the computer desks with a long trench coat and a baseball cap for the cincinnati reds that he was nervously gripping as he read his computer screen i didnt want to say anything to him to make him feel uncomfortable or anything so i walked past him and managed to see he was reading online reviews of vineland and whispering softly to himself
i work for a us gov funded research lab and was sent to antarctica a few years ago with the rest of my team we left the base to go to one of the spots where we needed to collect data and we saw a man hiking along singing showtunes he saluted us as he passed it was pynchon
  i know you are all trolling but my dad is good friends with him what do you want to know
  whats his goto sandwich filling
  obviously i dont know shit like that more general
  whats some books hes been reading
  how often does he bathe
  whats he working on
  from what ive heard older shit some joyce and chaucer actually side note he detest dfw    nothing but who really knows
  he detest dfw  haha
  my dad works for nintendo aswell anon what an amazing coincidence
  i think he got a bunch of fan mail from lit fags asking his opinion or something
  i wouldnt be suprised if he was browising this place or even opened this thread     pic related took this pic the last time i saw him
  looking good for his age
  demons age pretty well
  what is he like to talk to like mannerisms and stuff
  from what ive heard older shit some joyce and chaucer actually  hes probably reading them for the first time if at all the illiterate goon
  who is your dad
  how many joints does he smoke on a given morning or does he vape these days
  pretty normal dude not excentric or anything he does add a little tail to every story he tells though    just a friend of his from school
  ive never heard him mention wees one nor has my dad
  he does add a little tail to every story he tells though  im not sure what that means
its gonna be a sad sad day when pynch goes to the other side all those anons that will never get a chance to pretend to have seen him know him personally or be him themself
pynchon was the commencment speaker at my amateur improv class after handing us our diplomas he shocked us with a joybuzzer when we shook hands
  good post
  way to dick up the thread
  yeah it made me laugh hard
  one of my uncles did something similar my grandmother died he was some kind of dandy with an alcoholism problem so while the rest of his brothers and sisters were arranging the funeral he took some cash and jewels from my deceased grandma got drunk and went straight to a nice restaurant and took two stray dogs with him got a table and ordered food for him and his dogs thats one of the stories my mother told me about him
i saw him once in a bar in downtown manhattan around 2003 he was sitting on a stool at the bar mumbling quietly to himself while holding a bottle of absolut vodka by the neck he would occasionally take big swings of the drink and had finished about half of the bottle within 15 minutes of me being there the bartender would confront him every 3 swigs or so and try to make pynchon leave becuase outside drinks werent allowed pynchon would then go on to ask the man what his favorite fart joke was and the bartender would leave i got up from my table and approached him like i didnt know who he was and sat next to him i asked him how he was doing and he said he was glimglamtabulous after that he asked me whats your favorite cartoon funny from the telly and jabbed me in the side with his elbow while giggling i was in the process of answering him when he said well got to go old chap times a tickin and he handed me the bottle he stood up called the bartender over to implicate me of bringing in outside drinks and left the bartender sighed at me saying that pynchon had come in every day for the past week and had drove all his customers away apparently pynchon walked around the bar discussing cold war era politics differential equations the pitfalls of taoism and gay sex enough that no one would come to his bar anymore he broke down crying in front of me and vowed to kill pynchon the next time he saw him i went back to that same bar 3 days later and found out from a neighboring shop that the bartender had thrown himself from the roof 30 minutes after i left
  wow seriously
i was taking a dump at school and forgot to lock the cubicle door and pynchon opened the door he said sorry and he went in the cubicle next to me and had an explosive diarrhea dump it smelt really bad so i finished dumping and left without washing my hands
i saw him squeezing out my bedroom window as i rolled into my driveway once inside i found my wife lying spread eagle on the bed eyes rolled back in her head paralyzed by bliss with her cunt wide enough to fit a half dozen cue balls
  i beat the shit out of him decades ago and told him never to show his face in public again
  lmao
i was driving down the highway in providence in the summer a few years ago when sam hyde pulled up next to me in a juiced up truck i rolled down the window but before i could say anything he shoved the passenger door open and started making crazy faces and yelling nonsense at me i didnt know what to do so i just spit in his face and drove off
a couple years ago i remember one saturday i woke up hungover as hell because the night before i drank a whole bottle of vodka by myself so after i realized i was still alive and feeling a massive headache i decided to grab some breakfast at my usual place   managed to get out my shitty motel bed and get into the bathroom and i shit you not my sore eyes couldnt believe what i was seeing in the mirror turns out i was pynchon the whole time
  all was written on the business cards tom   ya only had to reach down your bootleg jeans pocket
    this is definitely pynchon telling a story about himself in the third person
  bump
  yearbook or fuck off
i was just wandering around new york one afternoon when i spied pynchon coming out of a side alley smelling suspiciously of off brand air freshener he looked me directly in the eyes and gave me a knowing wink as if my entire life had just been some elaborate build up to a joke orchestrated by none other then the pynchmeister himself and that now he would pull back the curtains to reveal the zany punchline of the whole thing then he turned around and started to walk away without looking back ive never been sure but i think i saw a bright yellow rubber chicken tucked under one of his arms as he faded into the teeming throng of people
pychon repeatedly raided our trash a few years back  he always came at night scattering the trash everywhere knocking over the cans and making loud grunting sounds  im not entirely sure but i think he was eating the leftovers we threw out the day before  anyway one day i managed to surprise and hit him with a broom he just screeched and scattered into the dark before i could land another hit  havent seen him around our house since then
in spanish because i cant turn off the autocorrect    trabajaba antes de profesor en una escuela de una zona de gentrificacion reciente en santiago de chile en el colegio organizamos un tallerconcurso para que los niños practiquen su escritura y alguien logro que pynchon estuviera en el jurado que componíamos además la persona que trabajaba en la biblioteca y yo que representaba al área de ciencias    al examinar los cuentos uno por uno frente a los chicos pynchon le dio la calificación de mediocre a todos los cuentos aunque nosotros habíamos indicado que solo habría excelentes muy bueno y bueno por no lastimar a los niños excepto a uno al que claramente el le había dado uno de sus propios trabajos para que ingrese al concurso    debido a que la tercera persona del jurado no reconocía lo que era el intento de pynchon de hacer pasar su escritura como la de alguien de doce y yo simplemente no tenía ganas de discutir le dimos el premio al cabro este el premio era una semana de almuerzo gratis en la cafeteria    durante la ceremonia tuvimos que entregarle a todos los niños sus mediocre pynchon ademas tiro desde una flor en su saco un chorro de agua a la abuela de uno de los concursantes cuando fue a tomarse una foto con nosotros y su nieto el cual era de una de las pocas familias de clase trabajadora que todavía quedaba por la zona    durante la semana siguiente dos de los cinco días me crucé a pynchon almorzando en la cafetería sin pagar
i was at a party at uni when i was younger and saw my acid dealer from afar there and was walking up to ask him if he had any acid on him when pynchon came out from behind some other people with a drink in his hand and started talking to my dealer he had a thick fuzzy gray mustache and bedraggled grayish white hair hanging down over his ears he also had groucho marx glasses on with the black mustache covering up his real mustache the music was really loud and i was still pretty far and walking up to them and i have pretty bad hearing in general so i couldnt hear the whole convo exactly but it appeared pynchon was asking him something my dealer responded affirmatively and asked a question himself then pynchon answered something and my dealer seemed pretty surprised and said something in response by this point i had gotten a lot closer and i saw my dealer pull out about 20 tenstrips from his pocket he seemed a bit nervous and said you sure about this man and pynchon was just saying yeah yeah man of course he took out a bunch of 20s from his pocket and paid him buying all the acid my dealer had and instantly just put all the strips in his mouth and started chewing them like they were candy it must have been hundreds of doses easily and my dealer was kinda worried but laughing at the same time and glad to have gotten so much money at once    i told my dealer that damn i was just about to ask him if he had any acid did he give it all to pynchon unfortunately yeah he did my dealer responded he was laughing kind of nervously but also kind of impressedly looking at pynchon wondering what was about to happen to him pynchon wandered about the party for another hour or so asking people if they had shrooms coke and even bizarre psychedelics few people have heard of or dare to do like amanita muscaria and datura aka jimsonweed this is what i heard from friends at least one of whom did indeed sell him some coke my dealer says tom came up to him an hour or two later still surprisingly together and told him youre a stupid fucking nigger and a sheep and its your kind which allowed the jews to do 9/11 and hoodwink the entire american populace right under our noses then he did a sort of handstand with only one hand somehow keeping the other hand behind his back and hopped out of the party on just that one hand    wherever that guy may be now and whatever hes doing i tip my hat off to him and hope hes doing well
holy shit i just met pynchon yesterday in a bar in nyc  so im sitting down with my gf having a cup of coffee when some lanky old dude with a newsboy hat enters the establishment and stands there at the door like an idiot for maybe a minute i recognize him immediately but im too far away to greet him besides i dont want to be mistaken and look like a fool  so he stands there for a good minute then he slowly starts strutting across the place to some generic samba music that was playing inside naturally im kinda weirded out but everyone else is just minding their own business like theyre familiar with him and see this every day  so he struts across the bar and continues to shuffle in front of the barista she asks him what he will have and pynch replies and how about you you mammary she laughs nervously and corrects him like he is a little child no youll have a milk with some lemon in it isnt that right pynch just keeps saying hell have her over and over again and does some weird ass spin which i suppose was meant as an invitation to dance of course she declines at this point im cringing like mad but cant stop watching he notices me and struts over to the table somehow i introduce myself and say im a big fan of his he starts laughing like a madman at first then he screams at my girlfriend while not breaking eye contact for 1520 seconds or so and so loud my ears literally start hurting from the vibrations he finally spits into her drink and says something like mmm kafe a la puttanesca im fucking frozen and dont want to do shit because hes looking really old and physically frail so im just taken aback while he struts out of the bar no music is even playing just the announcer talking  so that happened we just got the hell out of there barista apologizing to us and asking us to come again
  be in a bar in ny  go to toilet to take a shit  in the cabin next door theres a man  the man is mumbling something  he flushes the toilet  as he leaves he starts singing  its a song about bananas   in the tune of the beach boys  he left without washing his hands    as i leave the man in the third cabin starts singing the same tune    mfw

i ran into the pynch at a dollar general outside of elizabethtown kentucky he was looking at greeting cards and seem intensely focused on a jokey birthday card that featured an oldfashioned outhouse he wandered around after that and ended up buying 10 envelopes some chewy chips ahoy and one of those little eyeglass repair kits
  wow pynchon looks like a friend i used to have
  fake
  he detest dfw
back in 2004 i saw pinecone at a blockbuster in south carolina i was there to rent my favourite movie the terminator for like the fifteenth time pychon was at the register before me arguing with the cashier about why they did not have shrek 2 although it was released on dvd like 3 weeks previous i wanted to speak to him but i did not come up with anything to say
  this is the most plausible one
pynchon is a slightly retarded fella whos worked at my company for 30 yrs taking out trash and recyclables peeling vinyl off of sheet metal parts and doing simple preassembly he has a strong fetish for garage sales and this is where our paths converge in earnest he has a thing for any and all old radios and will buy any old country or polka he can find on record 8track or cassette when my elderly neighbor who headed a polka band the gene lebotte orchestra passed a couple years ago his widow gave me all the leftover copies of their 1984 record from friendly napawaupee i brought one to work for pynchon as a good faith gift and he was weird about it i think he expected more records he was a volume buyer apparently anyway now whenever garage sale season comes around or a new thrift store carrying used records opens up he taunts me im gonna get all the records polka records country western 50s  60s you dont get any etc he brags about how cheap hes going to get them and i know hes going to these places harassing folks trying to get them down to 50 cents on a dollar record at first it was funny but after several years of it its just kind of annoying
  i unironically believe this
  lol
  imagine lying about who your dad is friends with  next time sneak a picture of him and post it on here
do you think pynchon would visit a pynchon theme park  with a rocket shaped gravitys rainbow rollercoaster a mason/dixon trainway line a golden fang ferris wheel etc etc
  sounds like fun assuming theres less decay and child prostitutes trying to subvert you into doing their business than the theme park in gr  also needs a bobbing for don delillo novels tank

i know the first thing that comes to mind when you see an nge screencap is the bible but im looking for something different more along the lines of the literal scene itself im looking for books with themes about pinning down divine beings and defiling them for our own purposes
  i suppose another way to look at this one is rather than the idea of elevating man to divinity im interested in the concept of lowering divinity to the level of man
  i mentined it before but  de natura deorum by cicero is a great read
  confessions of a mask
  honestly ill read this just for the fact that you posted a borzoi i love those lanky alien dogs

always loved this quote     to the jew everything human is a sham one might even say that the jewish face is nothing but a mask the jew is not a liar he is the lie itself from this vantage point we can say that the jew is not a man  he lives the pseudolife of a ghoul whose fortunes are linked to yahwehmoloch he employs deception as the weapon with which he will exterminate mankind the jew is the very incarnation of the unearthly power of destruction

novel about fat acceptance which isnt romance
great wisdom is generous petty wisdom is contentious great speech is impassioned small speech cantankerous    what did zhuangzi mean by this
what he said
  those truly wise would be eager to share their wisdom whilst those arent would guard what they know jealously the person who speaks his beliefs out loud is honest and shows his dedication whilst the man who whispers them is a sneaky little rat bastard
  that makes sense
  the truly wise has the contemptus mundi whereas the falsewise is either a dullard or a coward for the reason that he is not allied with truth but with the self
now keep in mind what lao tzu says  when wisdom and knowledge appear great pretense arises    the more clever and cunning people are the stranger the events will be    those who know it do not speak about it those who speak about it do not know it    abandon wisdom discard knowledge and people will benefit a hundredfold    i have the mind of a fool understanding nothing    it is very easy to have your conception of great and petty wisdom mistakenly reversed
    he is wrong its important to argue about great wisdom
  the wise man is not happy without the modulations of idea and thought the rhetorician is not happy without the progression of argument and rebuttal the examiner is not happy without the tasks of interrogation and intimidation all are penned in by these things men who attract the attention of the age win glory at court men who hit it off well with the people shine in public office men of strength and sinew welcome hardship men of bravery and daring are spurred on by peril men of arms and armor delight in combat men of haggardhermit looks reach out for fame men of laws and regulations long for broader legislation men of ritual and instruction revere appearances men of benevolence and righteousness value human relationships the farmer is not content if he does not have his work in the fields and weed patches the merchant is not content if he does not have his affairs at the marketplace and well side the common people work hardest when they have their sunuptosundown occupations the hundred artisans are most vigorous when they are exercising their skills with tools and machines if his goods and coins do not pile up the greedy man frets if his might and authority do not increase the ambitious man grieves servants to circumstance and things they delight in change and if the moment comes when they can put their talents to use then they cannot keep from acting in this way they all follow along with the turning years letting themselves be changed by things driving their bodies and natures on and on they drown in the ten thousand things and to the end of their days never turn back pitiful are they not
  what thats not a true interpretation at all first the ideal taoist character would include a certain slyness and quietness its hard to imagine a taoist sage going around passionately and loudly telling everyone to convert to taoism and how important their own beliefs are isnt it a famous taoist expression that the empty pot rings the loudest when struck the meaning of the quote in the op is astonishingly simple its basically just what the words mean greatness is generous and sincere not petty and argumentative about small things
  unless you consider writing to be whispering well whatever doesnt seem like you thought about it anyway
  different anon i projected myself here a bit and interpreted is as if you contain real knowledge you can also sufficiently communicate it when need be/when you want if youre an argumentative prick like i can be you just snap/make things short and therefore inefficient in terms of knowledge and content thats my somewhat clumsy interpretation
  interesting enough point the beauty of the tao te ching is in how many meanings and how much beauty is suggested in so few words it takes talent to write aphoristically without just being dull or cliched
  if youre willing to share your knowledge with anyone what you know isnt probably worth much
well wisdom is freaking stupid real niggas are all about inquiry and chasing facts contention is important so is being honest passionate and intellectually empathetic whats not important are stupid proverbs that are intentionally vage so they can only lead to certainties that do not correlate to anything other than the utterances   that purposed them dab   this doesnt ask or answer any real questions loling at your silly caveman truisms
  its surprisingly hard to think of a good response to someone essentially saying fuck that pussy shit in response to mysticism or aphoristic thought the best response is probably just silence
  t spooked
  what if the knowledge is needed  say if i had the knowledge to cure a disease i would want to spread it everywhere
thoughts on whitehead
  why do you keep making this thread
more like blockhead
  he didnt heed me when i told him metaphysics is a difficult subject that requires a lot of preparation so i cursed him to do that until the end of his days
  his head is white
i read this book once i didnt get it read two introductions on processrelational philosophy still dont really get it
  i am unironically too low iq for him
    i doubt anyone in /lit/ really understands whitehead when he first started lecturing his fellow professors didnt understand hes probably only understood properly by a tiny group of people and somehow i dont think someone with brains like that posts here
  his head sure is white
  for me the closest i came to understanding him have been matthew segalls lectures then again that only proves i understand some guys interpretation of whitehead
  i understand the parts he shares with deleuze ie processoriented mentaphysics and the antiessential differential becoming ontology but nothing of actual substance
    i read his introduction to look at his catagories they mostly made sense but i had to compare him to peirce i think i had a problem with something he said about concreteness but i dont really remember and have no idea wether or not it was an actual problem or a superficial misunderstanding likely the later i want to return to whitehead after i finish with peirce peirce is difficult
  i really want to read his book and find out if its as difficult as people claim
    i want to read and have a good grasp on pm before i die
how do i get into the booktubing community/become a booktuber what are the best booktuber channels thanks
no
  you dont
why would you want to become a booktuber    it cant be for the money its a niche subject when it comes to youtube something you cant make a living out of  it cant be for the recognition youd spend your time actually studying to become an academic if that were the case
  why would you want to become a booktuber  because its basically being a vlogger but with books
1 be a girl  2 be a cute girl  3 dont be a not cute girl  4 read a bunch of ya and nothing else
  dear white people
best booktuber husbando coming thru
  theres even a booktubing community   its probably a bunch of boring clean youths who put no effort into their vain selfportait videos they most likely recite things i already know using clickbait like 10 things you should never do when writing anything and just overall are such fucking faggots their very appearance vomits hipster feelgood ad music into my ears as they bleed from listening to their futile starved and desperate attempts at turning youtube into some kind of career    also knowing the young writing demographic from my experience youll probably have to be nonbinary homosexual or a woman just to keep people from fucking lynching you
  how do i get into the booktubing community/become a booktuber  you dont  what are the best booktuber channels   bookchemist better than food fortheloveofryan forget the other ones
  ill give the girl in the bottom right credit for holding up books that appear to not be ya novels    wipeepo
  no way this isnt satirical
  
  why would you want to become a booktuber    for fun i suppose i have a booktube channel but hardly anyone watches it
  from cringe in the first 10 seconds to humorous to cringe again he needs to work on his craft although clearly its good enough to fool normies per the downboats not however that this is a difficult mark to reach
  lmao canadian chads are such dweebs

  what was the controversy im curious but not curious enough to actually watch any of these

  im guessing words are racist or something
  because they are a sort of aspiration brand to which op is particularly susceptible because he never had other role models in his life

  someone made a video whining about how most booktubers are white or something like that no one really cared but then this other chick made a video being fucking furious about it saying stuff like you people should be happy we welcomed you to the community and claiming booktube was already bending over backwards to be nice to you people   basically she sounded like a /pol/ hillbilly and people got mad her video is taken down now of course
  this other chick made a video being fucking furious about it saying stuff like you people should be happy we welcomed you to the community and claiming booktube was already bending over backwards to be nice to you people  based  whats her channel
  this feels like on of these pornographies
  whats her iq it seems low
  dont remember but i wouldnt be surprised if she deleted it
  is he /ourguy/  
  theres actually a very nice community of older people on booktube im surprised its never mentioned in these threads
  got some links
  im kind of glad it isnt a lot of young people on 4chan want nothing more than to harass anyone who can even vaguely be described as a boomer
  didnt link any since im worried about this  i dont want my favourite old booktube ladies to have the little tampon boy pasta spammed in their comments but its pretty easy to find by yourself
  not him but i stumbled upon this guy the other day  
    steve is wonderful
  we need more air time and things  ok we make a big point to welcome you so dont complain  no fuck you dont go out of your way to treat me different

  post it dont listen to him  post it
get the flavor of the month ya/fantasy/chicklit book  sloppy overview  spend half of the video saying how amazing it is  praise the female characters  some innocuous criticism enough to make the viewers feel smart but not too serious to make the fans/writer hate you in the middle of the video to keep the adhdfags hooked  say something about you even if its a lie like how this book helped you deal with hard times when your gf moved to another state  put the hunger games poster and a funko pop in the back while filming  to avoid people shitting on your channel and calling you a sold out make sure to review an important book from latin america eastern europe japan or middle east twice every year something with literary value that isnt well know a good start is men of maize and book of dede korkut  find a cute intro with those whistle songs used by big companies in their ads  after some time writters will ask you to talk about their books put this on repeat before replying to their emails/messages    
   the hunger games poster and a funko pop in the back while filming    this spot one of those in the background and you know youre wasting your time

  that was my initial thought too and i was about to complain when i realised that the same can be said for every other /lit/ thread
plot stops for nearly a hundred pages so the author can give excruciating detail about the characters
  novel is only a rant but still good

what translations do you like for dostoevsky and tolstoy i bought notes from underground and the double on a whim without looking in to it both translated by coulson
  translations
  apologies im uneducated
bump
avoid pv at all costs
  yeah ive read samples and its not good but then theres still a lot left to choose from samples from briggs translation of war and peace read well imo
i enjoy the pevear  volokhonsky translation for most of their books  get a lot of hate but i dont think i missed out on much
  i unironically take the original text and run it through google translate it provides me with the rawest and most realistic reading experience sometimes i use that translation to feed it into text to speech software in order to create an audiobook version
  look at the way pv butchered that first sentence thats a yikes from me
  how long until this method of text translation is truly viable
mcduff for brothers karamazov yes or no  ive read the first few pages from him pv avsey and garrett and honestly i had problems with all of them but his the least so

  a veritable phonebook of popculture movie references   no thanks
  the cover is a weirdly gaudy and saccharine departure from the usual liteedgy abstract covers these academic vanity presses default to

  how is this a poem
  maybe i misread but you and a lot of people seem to do this thing where you dont use complete sentences because old timey poems dont look like they use complete sentences on the surface but they do when those older poems are read properly you find that the verses connect into bigger sentences     twisting halls and their fallen king   is not a completely sentence your poem reads like a person bringing up completely random things like a checklist of imagery

those who have not learned to read the ancient classics in the language in which they were written must have a very imperfect knowledge of the history of the human race for it is remarkable that no transcript of them has ever been made into any modern tongue unless our civilization itself may be regarded as such a transcript  was he right
really like the atmosphere in this recommend something similar plez
  describe the atmosphere and then anon will recommend something
its 60s carefree la hippie era drug and sex glorifying i love the carefree part mostly   maybe i like it so much only because i been reading so depressive books lately such as no longer human and oblomov
well youd be wrong cuz it sucks
appreciate your input
  fear and loathing and las vegas  trout fishing in america
    maybe james ellroy underworld trilogy but thats because i think these books also pick up on the weirdness that is california at that time    if you think inherent vice is glorifying the hippies sex and drugs youre a retard and do not deserve pynchon
heard that vineland also by pynchon has a very similar vibe though i havent read it and it also has the reputation of being pinecones worst book
  i was actually describing the atmosphere as told
  it has a similar subject matter wouldnt say it has a similar vibe
  i was asking op actually
  its similar but inherent vice is much better imo the middle section of vineland is cringe inducing and borderline retarded maybe i need a second read to really appreciate it but it was annoying overall its an interesting novel to think about in the context of ruby ridge etc
  dog soldiers and children of the light both by robert stone are both at least partially set in the drug underbelly of 60s and 70s california they are less humorous and darker than iv
  im also interested in this iv is one of my favourite books i love it more even than gr something about the vibe the lingo and all the cultural artefacts of the sixties i cant get enough of    been down so long by feriña has a similar carefree silly vibe its a sixties campus novel written by one of pynchons closest friends who died shortly after finishing the novel    watch the iv movie if you havent and if you have watch the long goodbye by altman and night moves by penn
  seconding fear and loathing
  if you think inherent vice is glorifying the hippies sex and drugs youre a retard and do not deserve pynchon    that is exactly what it and pynchon does its not the only example either as vineland revolves around the same glorification of such things pynchon is a boomer in spirit and that is the boomer ethos
  i wouldnt say he glorifies the hippie era i feel like he takes a lot of the 60s clichés and deepens them through the book like how bigfoot starts as the straightlaced hippy hating cop and ends as a very three dimensional character i feel like hes actually trying to demystify the 60s trying to show how he saw them
yeah well op thats why noir books have such good atmosphere its basically pynchons crack at writing like chandler and m cain read any book by those two even though its la in the earlymid 20th century instead of the sixties the feel is quite the same the big sleep was imi better than inherent vice though pynchon is a more enthralling writer than chandler    chandler is infinitely quotable too almost every line in his books is cool
  pynchon is unambiguously enamored with and representative of the 60s milieu he is glorifying and even sacralizing the 60s because that is the cultural period that defined him this is transparent and the people trying to deny this are delusional
  yep that was all me u shouldnt be so hostile on internets m8
  i know youre being contrarian for some reason but  nah i agree that he clearly loves the cultural stereptypes and symbols of the 60s but throughout the novel he shows his own take on of what that time was beyond the cliches   pynchon actually lived in gordita beach during the sixties so i doubt he actually believes that the era was some kind of giant lel weed meme
  he is a marginally preboomer leftist celebrating the period that he cherishes and that defined him i dont know what deeper messages you believe there are that he is expressing but those ideas are ubiquitous now not deep or original but suffocating so its pure nostalgia i have read both vineland and iv as well as his essays where his politics are less concealed hes not saying anything new and his takes are the runofthemill boomer muh 60s counter culture revolution man bs every subsequent generation has been steeped in due to its nearhegemonic presence in our culture
  boomer  stopped reading there   you might as well have let out a big long fart
mr bungle
  thanks man gonna check that ty for the movie recommendation too    i would like to think that people on lit forum could understand what they read as i was just defining the atmosphere not the story as told    thank you will check    keep them coming please
  you do know that the baby boomer generation is an actual thing and not a meme right
  you dont really get pynchon if you think hes glorifying the 60s he thinks its an important period culturally but do you read gr and think hes sacralizing the 40s    doc sportello is a cuck and a pawn if you truly understood the plot you would have realized this they completely used him      but the hippies in vineland are losers if not scum who sold out to the fbi the mother abandoned her daughter to go rat out other hippies to the fbi the father is a wellmeaning retard who cant let go of the era      the problem with people who dismiss pynchon as well as the boring academic hacks who praise is that they simply dont put the work in to understand all the fine details of the plot they content themselves to think if its difficult to understand 100 he does it for that effect because dude weed lmao/collapse of metanarratives nothing could be further from the truth    really examine the geography of inherent vice dont neglect the gambling bet he makes towards the end pta doesnt include ithmmwonder why read a book like weird scenes by mcgowan and then come back to pynchon theyre both on the same wavelength
  valis gets this pretty well i think but i dont think its glorification or carefree
  that is the glorification you idiot and its not like the stuck up 2d right wingers have any more depth and are in fact even more of a mockery from the loser side of pynchon upset that those guys win in the end     that is the precise legacy of the 60s the glorification of the zoyd and the doc or for that matter the dude or the homer simpson or you name it that serves as a standin for the white male that is what the 60s made cool made honorable and made normal the righteous loser whose passive nobility we now see recreated over and over    pynchon imbibed that and personified its message he is a 60s liberal
  that is what the 60s made cool made honorable and made normal the righteous loser whose passive nobility we now see recreated over and over  isnt that more of a noir detective characterism
i wont let you go bump
  most of pynchons books are noir/detective novels
  i think thats the point pynchons making that dirty druggy hippies have the same positive characteristics as the noble dark 40s detective
  caps lock  that settles it

  im writing a trashy litrpg where the protagonist gets sent to a another planet along with his mom and he eventually gains harem like every other litrpg only difference here is that his mom is with him and she slowly becomes part of the harem if you really want you could just imagine everyone as furries i should warn you i only work on this story when im in the bathroom taking a shit though so you wont be seeing it anytime soon
  what the fuck is a litrpg
  i see what you did there but joe is a much better writer than that fat fuck
  sword art online basically
  what the fuck is that supposed to mean
what are your favorite series that have a emphasis on masculinity  masters of rome   there any series youve read that makes you want to better yourself physically  masters of rome
  its an entire genre basically theyre just western versions of japanese light novels complete with self insert protagonists with special snowflake abilities and and every girl within a five mile radius lusting after them which leads to the protagonist often having like seven wives
can anyone recommend me any books fantasy or scifi where the character has a harem    not those fake anime harems but the character has actual romantic relationships with two or more women and the ladies know of each other and at the very least tolerate each other
  try wild wastes
  its like playing a video game but for real
it any good the setting seems neat
its the 30th in some parts of the world in other words its discussion time  did you like the book  how long did it take before you figured out who the players really were what made you realize  whats your thoughts on the tour to lovecrafts dreamland  best player best companion best girl  any other thoughts    also reply with nominations for our next book to this post last book of the year
  lets be real a lot fantasy is basically interchangeable with anime/manga
is the black company series actually worth reading some people seem to love it while others hate it i never read any of glen cooks stuff so i dont know how good he is
has anyone else read this i know 800 pages is a big ask and its basically two books but i really enjoyed it despite the autistic tangent writing style
  its alright at the beginning but then it just drags on by the end of the series still i liked it for what it was
any scifi where the ai traps someones mind
  chapterhouse dune  last of the series by frank herbert  at this point i just want to get through it to finish the series off last one was a bit boring the story is getting old
  did you like the book  it was great better than expected desu ive been meaning to read lord of light since forever but now that ive got a taste of zelazny ill probably get around to actually doing it  how long did it take before you figured out who the players really were what made you realize  i figured out frankenstein as soon as the monster was mentioned the others took a while longer if i remember correctly i realized in the vicinity of chapter 13  whats your thoughts on the tour to lovecrafts dreamland  the worst and most jarring lacking a milder word reference or use of a pre existing character mostly because zelazny described it at such lengths the meeting with the cat was fine  best player  jack jill the based count i liked most of them best companion  same with companions i would say snuff or greymalk but mostly because they had the most exposure  best girl  greymalk obviously  any other thoughts  really great example of how you could/should use references and preexisting characters they enhance the story without it being reliant on people getting them
  imagine christopher paolini trying to deconstruct fantasy by writing a story where everything is a video game
  i finished it but i didnt like it too fucking dry
  no but its next on my list after i finish the gap series
  that sounds like the absolute worst
    forgot to make a nomination i feel like its time for dick again i nominate the man in the high castle
  despite the autistic tangent writing style  but isnt that the whole appeal of stephenson
  my first foray into the guy im reading snow crash right now i definitely think it fits hard scifi the best
the sword of truth series by terry goodkind yay or nay
  nay
  how bout you read the last thread
  yeah it pretty much is its almost like a parody from a cyberpunk novel where people obsess over the thought of getting access to a vr game but its entirely serious    naturally a certain site that starts with r and rhymes with edit loves it you can probably picture it yourself legions of autists proclaiming that mincrafter for life book one of the builder saga is the greatest thing theyve ever read      demon chicken
  is that darkwolf from fire and ice man i loved that movie underrated gem of a fantasy film
  the shitter does seem to be the place where inspiration hits most often
should grrm be put in jail for writing fire and blood
gimme some first contact fiction preferably startrek style where a spacefaring humanity meets some other race or races doesnt have to involve wars or political machinactions and doesnt have to be a space opera something about cultures or societies would be nice also as view povs as possible i dislike having many point of views
  botns
  i didnt like it at all
  the great thing about them is that theyre willing to get down in the genre gutter and just roll around in male fantasy in this age of prissy rightthinking nice books its kind of refreshing if you want that or if you are an actual gay man who wants to see his hobby in books chances are its right for you

    dude look how edgy i am i killed my half brother who did nothing to me
  i didnt read it with you guys but i have read it three times i think see how i do    did you like the book  very much  how long did it take before you figured out who the players really were what made you realize  some were pretty obvious some i still dont think i get im sure theres some znugget originals  whats your thoughts on the tour to lovecrafts dreamland  felt like sandman to be honest  best player   wolfman was a bro  best companion   the rat was also a bro  best girl  sherlock  any other thoughts  zelazny shaming lesser authors by fitting more myth and jazz in fewer words than any of our modern mental midgets the english countryside becomes a zelaznian dreamscape as effectively as any shadow in the amber series my favorite use of an ambiguous ending
female knights
  the first book is longer and better and actually has a perfect ending the magic robots were lame but the poetic endings of all the 2010s online personalities were worth the price of admission
  count to the eschaton
    not really you can get the harem without the god awful game mechanics that comes with litrpgs
  dismissive opinion  using the term edgy  greentext    this is the most /lit/ post ever
  this a brothers price had the harem and it was chicklit
  i agree the highlight of the book sort of the whole point is how realistically the ending could happen without suspending the disbelief of the reader in the slightest the second book felt a bit unnecessary but on reflection i think it tied up all the but what about questions readers would have about the first half so it was necessary if a bit strained
  would have been better as a novella on his website
is the anon that recommended blood music here i read it its not really a horror story just a slightly more disturbing version of something doctorow would like i liked it but more for the biotech maneuvering in the first half than anything that happened after benjamin melted i still say hull zero three was the better ride  starts with almosttimeless depiction of jealous scientists and politics in tech  suddenly west germany and the world trade center
ok /sffg/ i just ordered this from amazon because it is so often recommended here so if you were memeing me you better come clean
  if by meme you mean tenderly love were meming you all night long
guys be honest with me right now    is it racist for me to write a wuxia novel where everybody is white
  its not racist in a post cleansing dystopic society  do some worldbuilding
  i just find asians to be less physically interesting than caucasians
    definitely read the first three books
  lmao nah    t read the first five or six books
  as long as you explain why non asians use asianesque stuff so commonly like that one book about a kid living in the american prefecture of the japanese empire attending school to be a mech pilot
    nah it was pretty good just finished the first half the other day
  aaahhh  okay quick someone toss me some fucking idea for explaining why someone would be good at technomagic type before actually undergoing the training necessary to really use it and that requires the least explanation while i try to fucking figure this shit out  fuck i wish i was better at scheduling so i didnt have to depend on fucking up college to actually get shit done
  nanomachines son
  why did i have to write such a convoluted idea as them having to learn magic in a vr world made from the dreams of its users so they can then use it irl even though the technology is later destroyed any way asdfadfasfsdafads  fucking kill me it was supposed to be background that i didnt go into why did i  aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh
  depends if you want smut with your harems or not
    experiemented on as fetus/child
  chosen one glitch in the system someone hacked their ability unknowingly depends on context
  oh  actually nanomachines so he was a natural at weird cybernetic implant shit which indicates potential for netflow but then the implants couldnt be used after the great malfunction okay that works
  go to sleep
  cant inspection tomorrow and miscommunication with teacher but you have a point i need to relax and get more caffeine theres not much for it and i should enjoy doing my work even despite all this shit  i need to keep my creativity flowing
  because asians arent people amirite
  note ive read this before  did you like the book  immensely it was my introduction to zelazny i started reading more of his works on the strength of this one  how long did it take before you figured out who the players really were what made you realize  most fairly quickly since im a fan of supernatural classics although it took an embarrassing amount of time to pinpoint who jack was the first time around  whats your thoughts on the tour to lovecrafts dreamland  a wacky change of pace that i didnt like on my first read but really appreciated this time around i think because on my first read i was more preoccupied with the mystery and figuring out the players and disliked the interruption second time around i knew it all already and could be more indulgent and allow myself to soak it in   best player best companion best girl  count for top tier player snuff is best boy greymalk best girl  any other thoughts  one of my favorite lovecraft inspired novels and also one of my favorite homages to victorian supernatural literature also a masterclass in how to perfectly execute a shorter novel and do more with less 10/10
  only physically interesting people are human  i like the cut of your jib
  the fact that the sword isnt straight bugs me more than anything
  big tits
  oon an antihero that functions partially as a villain with a not entirely unwarranted god complex who takes over a significant portion of the world with his superhuman abilities and is meant to represent the concept of vilification to simultaneously unsettle readers and provide catharsis as they ponder the idea of this crazy powerful blood craven man being a hero
  just do what he says
  yeah  except for the man part
  asians are cool im just less familiar with them and do not want to offend anyone
    bbut he has a love inte oh  no im sorry i dont think id want to write such an intellectual and groundbreaking idea  its just too much for me im sorry guys
  write whatever the hell you want to write anon fuck worrying about offending anyone especially the faggots who look for reasons to be offended
    hang on let me rewrite these
  wwait one more time
  how is this literally never heard about it before but i like this picture plot sounds kinda cool
  rewritten again      rewritten      most people arent as easily offended as you think anon    even some people who seem sjw at first are usually not as bad as you think thats how i thought my class was for a while but as you workshop with them you realize its not really as bad as you think even if they happen to disagree with you on some minutia or sometimes even some real significant shit theres even several transgender/nonbinary/whatever types that havent really been an issue  theres only one person so far who in my opinion and perception really does seem pretty damn close to one of those extreme did you just assume my gender types but sh i mean uhh what is it again it if there was someone to spew some crazy shit usually the crazy shit came from it it didnt really seem to get mad really but goddamn it was fucking crazy and made me dread workshop    eventually it tried writing a piece about getting unduly upset with cisgender white people and even with that one extreme in the class they were brave enough smart enough and tactful enough to work around discussing how people have different opinions for different reasons and all this other shit    this appeared to shut it up in a later class it tried getting offended with one of the pieces someone presented where a male author happened to mention a girl wanting sex and the sex happened to be straight sex and even with that one extreme in the class they were brave enough smart enough and tactful enough to work around discussing how people have different opinions for different reasons and all this other shit this time and from then on it couldnt even find the words to discuss her opinion it was cathartic and i think it is changing as it undergoes cognitive dissonance now      besides its not like youre doing this for the money right who cares what they think just write it if youre unlucky enough to encounter people who give two fucks ignore their shit opinion    also if you want make sure you get cultural stuff right you can just look it up and ask questions that is a decent thing to consider now i think about it cuz if you dont get it right people who know their shit maybe wont get offended but it can be distracting and make it hard for them to enjoy your work surprisingly in my experience you can sometimes actually solve these things through workshop    just dont worry about offending people
  thought it was fantastic the way he included epigenetics in the second book was kind of sloppy and pointless though    my favorite stephenson book is anathem though  people get so caught up on the jargon but it is excellent sf
  rewrite it twice  leave in pronoun fuck up and that one time i forgot to replace it with another word  my autism has failed
  anathem really was a great ride
  do it again or you get the lash
  youre writing a reply on 4chan not a peer reviewed essay calm down
    now write it out 100 times
when did you realize most popular books are downright mediocre reddittier trash i can go through top 10 lists and best of genre and only find one or two moderately entertaining books is fiction really this shitty     where am i supposed to find good recommendations the oh pee hasnt helped much
  i mean i dont even read much i just sincerely havent enjoyed a lot of what ive tried and its pretty disheartening
    did you like the book    quite a bit my only other zelazny experience was lord of light and he takes that same slightly irreverent love to lovecraftian horror and folk magic to the point where i consider it a better version of fate/apocrypha    how long did it take before you figured out who the players really were what made you realize    ive been reading up on a certain victorian figure in other ways lately so as soon as they made sure to mention that mans knife elegantly i had him pegged the count is also obvious i had more of a problem with false negatives i was wracking my mind for who jill would be if rastov was rasputin etc    the deciding moment was as soon as the great detective showed up i knew this was a crossover work    whats your thoughts on the tour to lovecrafts dreamland    i loved it lovecraft would have been happy to see another writer using his dreamland at times it felt like a parody on the purple prose but i am almost always down for listing the dark history and culture of a dreamworld    best player best companion best girl    the count is absolutely the most skilled player snuff did the most work of any companion sherlock is the purest girl    any other thoughts    this proves to me that we need to return to basics in a big way fantasy is plagued by epics and a need for a trilogy to turn into a quadrilogy to turn into a saga write me a story with the density of lead and the length more of a novella than a novel
  tfw zelazny could have lived to experience nasuverse
    what have you been reading there is a good chance fantasy/scifi isnt the right genre for you personally ive given up on fantasy its just wish fulfillment for feminists and soibois almost nobody working in the industry cares about good writing or plot structure its just a cash cow for publishers to stretch out a story unnecessarily into ten novel series and then hope it gets adapted into a television show    try some historical fiction the writers working in that field are of a higher quality they have to actually research things and make their work logically consistent without magic deus ex machina bullshit ive also been having a lot of fun with spy thrillers and crime novels
    my nomination is doomtime the arboreal warfare story
  i loved hyperion but i cant bring myself to listen to the sequel    the magicians was pretty great too but couldve done without the cucking    stormlight archive was pretty great but the third book was a bit much im not liking the scale the story is moving into    i also enjoyed ellc and wild wastes to a lesser extent    blindsight was amazing but again i cant bring myself to listen to the prequel/sequel     seveneves farenheit 451 moon is a harsh mistress we are legion prince of thorns and a ton of other meme shit were pretty bad
im actually so mad rn sapowskis lady of the lake and it was the lamest ending to a series which up until half way book 4 might have been on my list of goats    does anyone else here know what i mean i cant believe he just kill all those characters he built up over the course of those books and then leave geralt yen and triss basically as loose ends and give ciri who hed spent the entire series hyping up as the child of destiny to just marry some random knight could have ended up with cahir or something but no then the 1000 year time jump honestly who the fuck signed off on this ending
  the battle of brenna was goat though fuck milftartians
please tell me cadsuane gets her cunt kicked it at some point
  nope sanderson has a softspot for her
in fantasy well damn it was a great year for fantasy i read at least half a dozen books so good that they made me say i wish id written that the heroes by joe abercrombie was an action tour de force an entire novel built around a single battle lev grossmans the magician king was a worthy successor to the magicians and proof that last years hugo voters knew what they were about when they voted grossman the campbell award as the best new writer in the field and daniel abraham yes him again damn him did something i would not have thought possible he published a novel called the dragons path the first volume in the new epic fantasy series called the dagger and the coin and it was just as bloody good as his long price quartet  any of those books would be worthy nominees but none of them were the best epic fantasy i read last year for my money that has to be the wise mans fear by patrick rothfuss  wmf is the second volume in rothfusss kvothe series and it took him nearly as long to write it as i took for a dance with dragons hey im glad it did he drew some of the fire but it was worth the wait i gulped it down in a day staying up almost to dawn reading and i am already itching for the next one hes bloody good this rothfuss guy the wise mans fear should rightly contend not only for the hugo but also for the world fantasy award  jesus christ how does he have such unbearably shit taste
so what are some fantasy books or scifi with genuinely unique settings some really alien worlds that when you initially go in seem a bit overwhelming but when you start getting into the swing you want to know way more about  ive already read dune which id say is a decent example of what i mean
is there any decent novel that takes place in a forest in which the main character is a dryador other forest race

  hes a sff author intelligent people write historical fiction
  some i still dont think i get im sure theres some znugget originals  yeah i dont think jill owen the vicar or the duo are supposed to be anyone preexisting just generic witch druid and so on    best girl sherlok  absolutely based      jack  figured him out quite quick made the connection between knife wielding jack and murders in london quite quick the count on the other hand i felt like a retard when i finally realized
  rastov is rasputin right sometimes he felt more like just some mad orthodox priest    about the companions snuff was a calculator but were there any other companions that actually did more than gather information and help with ingredients
  this based im glad ive always had good roman calves
  worth nothing if you dont have a roman nose
  lord of light
the tylin/mat arc is infuriating
  my nose is a lot like augustuss but then most of the good martial emperors had short straight noses like us
  the word for world is forest/trees
    when youre recommended a book youre supposed to look at the blurb and quick check reviews to see if you like it  check some of books 
  augustus   martial emperor
  its very cookie cutter fantasy in the same vein as lotr though if you just want a comfy fantasy to read then its great
  i think i might actually remember my dad talking about this book when i was little
  the iron dragons daughter  dragons are malevolent fighter jets interdimensional travel weird magic weird in general    pic related if thats not weird enough
took anons advise and started reading masters of rome while listening to wheel of time its makes a nice change of piece jumping from a series where all the men have their balls in a clamp to a series where the main character murders his two girlfriends who hed been neeting off his entire life while fucking a twink
  should have said also most of the good martial emperors    not a neet hes a net he was very educated what gets me is that it takes 250 pages for the main characters to meet each other but its great before and after
wanted to think of something like the jedi / sith order but i cant think of anything thats not obvious copy of them
  hahaha holy shit im so glad ill never touch one of his books

  and you never will just write your own
galactic pothealer has been the most traditional fantasy of pkd ive read so far
  sabriel was pretty good
  did i like the book  any other thoughts  yes it was enjoyable its always good to see illustrations by gahan wilson the book was short and sweet i almost always like zelaznys prose/voice the characters were fun and the ending had tension and surprises     my only criticism is that the story retreads a lot of ground that he had covered before on one hand im disappointed that he didnt try something new i consider him one of the stars of sff because of lord of light and a bunch of truly excellent short stories amber is my favorite series yes i recommend it often because its good and he has definitely influenced my own writing while he was capable of greatness night didnt hit that level for me it was only pretty good on the other hand i wonder if he knew he was dying when he wrote it he died of cancer a couple of years after night came out as the last book he wrote night in lonesome october is a good summation of his lifes work in a story well told with charm and humor
gives your book a backhanded review
  upvotes and menstruates
any fantasy with roman legions teaching elves and orcs true law
currently reading pic related its cool
all these harem fantasies are the same if youre going to go down the harem route then add some variety where are the milfs where are the mother/daughter combos if a writer is going to go down the actual harem route then go all the way to the utmost point that you can which in this case probably stops at incest
  i have never read harem fantasy but i guess its because the authors dont want to delve straight into porn territory
i started botns i hope you guys arent memeing me again
  i hope you enjoy peasants speaking like sokrates
  botns is not only a meme its probably the best sff ever written however its not for everyone
thrall is out nyuggas   also wuxia written by the super sales guy
  im gong to be honest with you my man these all look like trash i know the whole dont judge a book by the cover stuff but still also im familiar with the daniel black series and its pretty shit last time i left off how do you manage to be a third wheel in your own harem
  thats completely fair   for my part its really the happening part a lot of things just happen in these types of books and they happen so fast you that you kinda want to continue reading just to know what happens   it can really suck you in
  dont say that anoni will find itbut for now i will just read doujins
have there been any legitimately good ya fantasy since the early 2000s
  the jinx series by blackwood is great 2013
i havent really enjoyed reading science fiction for quite some time now and it makes me sad
  i hate ya literature even when i was a young adult i hated it
  have there been any legitimately good ya  no kinda hard to make what is essentially teenage wish fulfillment genuinely good
    if were going to read dick can we do a scanner darkly been meaning to read it for a while
  see 
hello guys i am a bit struggling to put a name on the distant memory i have of some kind of science fiction novel or maybe was it a different kind of writing  i am not very sure but maybe you could help me  it was about some kind of earth shaped pyramids floating in space and i remember that the thing was about developping a crazy universe with different kind of physic rules than our own  i think that the definition of time was especially extreme  i remember that it was posted on 4chan occasionally this is where i saw that thing  i have made a shitty drawing of my memory so if it sound something to anybody please tell me
  sounds vaguely like the three body problem though ive never read it
  ah thanks but it is not that  despite the similarities of the illustration what i am talking about seemed a way lot more crazy it was more like trying to redefine what would be a universe with different set of physic rules
  it was more like trying to redefine what would be a universe with different set of physic rules  yeah i thought thats what it was about or the sequels i didnt actually recall the cover  we might have to wait till someone whose read it pops by
    actually trying to think about it more made me realise the illustration may have looked more like this drawing with a hourglass shape kind of world  lets hope you are right and someone will find the name behind this
  not him but i can only think of the integral trees or nightfall for odd solar system geometries neither had pyramids or sounds like what youre looking for sorry
  it is sadly not that either but thank you for your response  i try looking for it online but there is really no way of putting into words my memory without running into new age stuff i really hope i have not made up this thing in a dream or something without me noticing it  i swear i saw that on 4chan multiple time some years ago
  incredibly lazy selfinsert books based around desperate wish fulfilment from their virgin authors
  it put me off that the intro has the strong independent native canadian woman beating up a man for taking a photograph of the literal prostitute shes with
      submit small segment of novel to workshop class  it was rushed and involved a lot of exposition   fully realize only after i submit it all the rest of the problems im going to list now  the dialogue is stilted forced and just generally awkward exposition that i couldnt fix in time   theres probably too much bullshit going on with the dream machine thing and then the dream machine thing being destroyed leaving most likely only two characters able to use lost technology and the vr world remaining undiscussed for 99 of the story because the only reason it matters its to set up this idea of the mc wanting to return to a corrupted version of the vr world then i have to have it make sense that the world doesnt fall completely into chaos because of reliance on fucking magic which i havent decided how to do yet  real story is just between three characters and doesnt necessarily even need all this complex shit  the part im going to share is just plain shit where i use the cliche of oh look heres this guy who should know shit but im gonna make a lame excuse for him to not know shit so i can dump exposition on you during his training where i suddenly and accidentally end up making up some kind of technomagic academy the kind of cliche shit only a fanfiction faggot would write  i now have several pieces from several different perspectives all scattered around in time despite not even being sure i have an outline and being and utterly terrified with the idea of forming an outline even when my instructor strongly recommended i develop one theres even a part where a character has a flashback  remember when i wrote my previous works that people liked i could feel myself enjoying what i was writing and almost trying to stop myself from saying this is great and all that i didnt have this kind of feeling writing this part    god fucking damn it i dont even know what im doing any more
are there any books that involve interspecies sex where the author doesnt have a joke name
  what the fuck are you even trying to say
  wise mans fear
  thats actually embarrassing
  probably because then it means its a trashy joke book like all those ones of women fucking raptors
  anime and manga are a broad and poorly defined grouping that defines a pool of styles and/or an entire pool of works from a country of millions belonging to two entire mediums not a genre you fucking cunt  no shit fantasy is interchangeable with fantasy
  so he just wants a super serious book about raptor sex then thats it  i guess im not one to judge
lads    is this worth reading    was he really a chinese tolkien
  read a little more into it  gender neutral they/them character is one of the mains  well shit i just thought the setting sounded neat didnt realize it was one of those books

  this was really good  tfw we finally get to discuss this and im late to the party  how long did it take to find out who was who  i got jack and frankenstein immediately but i had no clue as to who rastov and jill were  dreamland  i liked it the best part was greymalk riding on snuffs back  best player  snuff without a doubt but the rat was great too greymalk was best girl  any other thoughts  this is better than any 1000 page epic fantasy tome could ever hope to be and now id like to read his other works hopefully theyre just as good    i nominate jack vances first dying earth book is there a list of all the previous monthly books weve read somewhere
  rangers apprentice
      yes  that was indeed the dichronauts  thank all of you for remembering this  this night i was convicing myself that i just dreamed all of that that i had a false memory or something and that i was crazy telling stranger on internet about that but god i am glad its not the case      thanks for your response but my memories was in fact about this   you can tell by the shitty drawing that i had a very faint memory of it     thanks everyone 
  is there a list of all the previous monthly books weve read somewhere  tfw i forgot to link to the pastebin this month too

  if grrm caked his face in paint he would look as good
  the witcher series has some fine waifus
  i bet she looks like shit without makeup
  maybe if he lost some weight      i guess well never know
  ive wondered whether someone who isnt a native english speaker would like discworld it seems very british/comedy focused and that kind of thing can be lost on people who arent familiar with the culture for example i read hitchhikers guide to the galaxy another british comedy book and it didnt do anything for me whatsoever is discworld different
  run her through the makeupremoval app
  dont worry pratchetts jokes are so underlined and go on for so long theres no chance theyll fly over anyone
    why dont you just try one
  aaaaaaaaaaaaaa
  holy fuck
  what      well thats an actual model
  post more
  i started with discworld translated into my language so some of the puns and rhymes didnt translate that good but i dont think there is something inherently british that those books have as the books do take place in a completely fictional world additionally the books do not seem at least to me very comedy focused as the humor is part of the world building but the story/plot are solid and not just a joke
anyone here contribute to the frozen hell kickstarter it ended earlier today i pledged for a hardcover copy
  anon this is a board meant for discussion of literature not what i saved from instagram
  whoops whats her instagram
  as the humor is part of the world building but the story/plot are solid and not just a joke  sounds good ill give one a try i think im between mort and guards guards which do you think is better
  whoops whats her instagram  for fucks sake anon  the filename      fine one more

  i assure you its all shoop and angles
rereading eragon  writing starts out clean and straight forward  a few cringey bits but well paced and structured  in book 3 author starts to meander and get distracted by minutiae  by book 4 conversations and descriptions that wouldve taken a few sentences before now span several pages without adding more information  tfw the author actually gets worse at writing as the series goes on  yeesh
  he doesnt fuck the god damn elf
  i dont have a kindle how do i read this book
   eragon  why would you do this to yourself christopher paolini is one of the biggest hacks in modern fantasy he makes j k rowling look like j r r tolkien
  whats worse the books or the movie
  the first part is interesting and somewhat unique the second part is a mess and almost ruins the first section not much to be done about it i recently reread it and simply skipped the future nonsense
  i read a few books a week its no great loss theres a lot of copy and pasted lore but i enjoyed the first few books well enough i have a lot of patience for bad books and movies  theyre charming in their own way the 4th book is definitely testing my limits though    amuses me that hating harry potter has become a meme on every board though
  why dont you try reading something better
  is this shit a meme or is it legit good
  legit good
  a meme
  its literally 1 spammer
  its not even a legit meme
  there are only so many bad books on the world im sure ill bump into a good one eventually
          im getting mixed signals here
  there are a lot of people here who hate all women authors
  even if thats true  maaspamming has nothing to do with it
  there are people here who dont hate women authors
  probably  just like there are people that read litrpg
  id read a litrpg over a woman author any day
  its not really hate but there is a precedent a very vast precedent that a lot of fiction written by women is just bad the exceptions like le guin for example only prove the rule
  exactly  as i was heavily implying  you have no taste
  i mean the fact that that anon avoids female authors says otherwise imagine actually reading a fantasy or scifi novel written by a female im in tears just thinking about it
didnt the limit use to be 300 posts
  its ya fiction it goes by pretty fast light on the prose and world building and a little too influenced by hunger games but its still fun to read i only read the first book though
  it still is newfriend
  depends on the board my crossposting hombre

  not in the catalog either but now it is

raconteur bon viveur witch king of nihilism author of the first law and shattered sea books    not that bad nihilism is a big yikes though
everything creative writing related goes here    question of the thread  is the stigma revolving around being published through means besides traditional publishing warranted as far as i can tell its just a means to bully writers into letting publishing companies take more money from a writers pocket
  traditional publishing houses have expertise in advertising books as well as existing relationships with reviewers journalists and critics they are also connected to bookshop merchants and officials of competitions who can be bribed to rig awards most self published authors dont have those existing relationships expertise or resources and suffer low readership because of it
how would you title a shot like this in a screenplay i was thinking something like     ext  highway  characters car    does that seem right
  yes but does that justify the stigma the whole self published vs real published isnt a meme
  theres self published authors that sell hundred times more than real published authors    its just a shaming tactic to justify their existance    theres plenty of web novels in japan that became hits among light novels and made into big animoos for example

jorjani is such an odd fellow i quite like him as a philosopher and hes clearly highly intelligent but hes into some seriously crazy shit when it comes to politics and spirituality    
  philosophy is so much easier when you have no god to tie it to
he seems like a cuckoo but at least he doesnt misreprent philosophers like peterson does  although to be honest he paints them in really broad strokes in the video

uh poetry crit thread     please lambast my poem that has lots of archaic cliches      oh i do not know you my great norway  though i act well acquainted to the cold  i like it for the quiver of nipple  which i could play without corruption or    to be ennobled in dreary lines abode  i tender only for her versage   that lies in nature all alone    but as i grow old i find the coasts   but in norway that which naught home    so to daisy i sing song only  to replace dreams misplaced by spinster laced  through cholera i once thought thrace    ones true image is given gods found grace  i find palette in her youthful hands that care   and no longer have grateful choice to chase

  im sorry anon but this isnt very good    the language itself is very forced and clearly ripped from a thesaurus but not even in an aesthetically pleasing way    the lack of any semblance of meter is painfully obvious when reading it because the forced language makes reading it a drag    in general its also quite boring not really sure of what im reading and not feeling anything    sorry for the harsh critique lad but you seem like this is something you really want to get into and id like to help

 is me ill critique two poems quickly        the idea of wisdom knowledge and experience juxtaposed to the brash vigorous sensuality of innocence strikes a high note the tone and diction the wise man the young girl made me recoil a bit i found it too serious and grave the general poem also wishes it had a bit more personality it falls into cliché here and there and doesnt find a voice along the way there are line length issues also i find as the tone and freeflowing lines disagree with each other overall i found the idea behind the poem more interesting than the representation you made of it i may be wrong but i think you might be still more of a thinker than a writer which is fine because you are a good thinker who has something to say and writing is a craft that is developed        i really like the first line the rhythm is heady yet poignant unfortunately you fail to build upon this and rather aggravate the headiness into clunkyness afterwards as the rhythm is all over the place also the four lines and four images seem disconnected fail to come to a haikulike painted image of anything except a vague suffering poems about inner strife especially need to stand out since they are kind of banal and i think you would be better served to tie your images to one concise whole that encapsulates your emotions
  i understand the urge to include vulgarity in order to shock or intentionally subvert the punch line and/or conclusion but i resent it just for the sake of it id reccomend trying to write a sincere conclusion other than that i enjoy this poem it has nice images and feels genuine
    i should also add that you have several cliches cookiecrumbling midnight snacking marry me etc that are kind of comical and playful because of their context and relationships with one another and especially considering the title its pretty effective but be aware that you cannot write every poem this way it gets tiring i applaud how much you fit into a few lines that is always a sign that some thought predicated the work
the noblest roman    and the elements so mixd in him  that nature might shun his janusfaces  his resolve which wills and effaces  even the loftiest of men  into mangled lifeless corpses    mere playthings for the outpour   the surging and burning  excrucior  timeweary tyrant plaguing our present  who signifies decline but such titans  natures last resort  aims set against that man to thwart  he in whom his other half  contrives gainst him is doomed  burdened   point of departure resounding flight  leave of your idyll thou superman  come crashing down with promethean might  eve of all joys  hibernal comfort in circus and bread  let those noble souls sleep as the dead
  2/2    et in arcadia ego    et in  here the garden pond lies still  unmoving  firmly held by the moss and lilies  and dear times ardent watch  lets no life spring forth any longer    in arcadia  here the garden tree has cast off its fetters  shade no more graces the wood  dead barren limbs  sprawling roots vying for light  oaks bury their face in shame    et in arcadia ego  and here the garden stone commands the eye  to look around its necessity  unyielding implacable  verdant hills rushing oer the horizon  but hither stays his gaze    he is in arcadia  now and forever
    its the 21st century what do you know about noble romans solid work recreating a bygone style i guess
  hit or miss  i guess they never miss huh   you got a boyfriend   i bet he doesnt kiss yah   he gon find another girl and he gon miss yah   he gon skrrrtt and hit the dab like wiz khalifa
  i admit i am extremely out of touch with poetry in the past 50 years
  you have the aptitude to make some good contemporary stuff if you feel like becoming familiar with it
  thank you do you think i should start by focusing on different themes or should i adopt a more contemporary style
coffee is in that white cup  with sun drags on a left edge  then smells like lavender at three   we hang christmas lights  there are headlights it is  softened by the rain it is  red and white headlights  fanning on my room mm  mmmmmmmmmmmmsh  goes the car   in the rain which seems sweet  and smells it too  good hue good  seeing branches  on my wall and you
  its always reliable to write what you know write about a nice image or a strong memory as long as its something you really know and beleive in i bet just by doing that your style will bring itself up to date
  alright well this is an older one and ive already saved it and think its actually kind of shitty for various reasons especially well i digress any way given i dont give two fucks about it i might as well post it to an anonymous board      it shines halcyon beams on the grassy dew  it roams like a horse unsaddled as it caresses the sky  with no rider to guide it no person to decide  wherever it goes and it goes there  where it wants  for every stroke of light  across valleys which hold so anciently  times of rock and granite  sealed beneath boulders     and over acres the plants reach and ache for it  so much worship do those plants who green under it have  that when it begins its journey away the grass will dye itself the colour  we earth things colour it     and in battle it darkly sanguines the blade  and in hunting it blackens the fowl red and cooked  with daylight too bright for uncertainty     whether in blood or calm warmth     whether pooled or vast  it must always take grandest form  for light can only be great     light can only be aristocracy
  this is interesting and i kind of like how it ends in and you but im not really feeling the sound effects thing in the middle personally
  this what i got so far    we are the children of cain  ephemeral  drawn so near yet thrust beyond grasp  hands outstretched hoping to clasp  or clutch but a single moment more  our dice were rolled by malicious hands  rigged though our game now seems  it affords us an opportunity to sip and savor  and pour out libations to fortune in spite to  ask for a solitary favor  roll again dark hair  roll again spectral eyes  peer into my cyclic turnings and yearnings  those painful longings far removed  from our warm nights  we are stripped of all pride  deprived of our concordant sights  only the rays of bursting brilliance  feelings resilience  pours in through fogdrenched glass  this last waltz i must have  and as it rises in company with  amorous song and dance  you whisper to me   who has old fortune done for us  but given us a chance
  it was definitely a risk im trying to work up a way of making that sound effect without onomatopoeia
  whats this about its not totally clear to me anyways and i hope this doesnt seem too abrasive but i think youre writing things strictly for the music and to capture a particular tone that you enjoy and not paying close attention to what you really feel or remember again i dont know what youre writing about so i cant tell you for certain that youve failed to capture your feelings accurately but thats how it sounds to me let me know if i have completely missed something
  i think you hit the nail on the head i really didnt know what i wanted to say and was caught up in neat sounding phrases the feelings i wanted to express were there but i can see how they were smothered by devices
wwhy did they skip over mine
hey guys do you like free verse
  which one was yours
entity in entropy   stasis but a while  agree with them   that time is still   another phrase beguiled    a window tree  from a dampened chair  abrasions soft to touch  prophetic attempt  day old shrimp   sleepwalking far too much
  its good that you recognize that part of writing poetry is knowing yourself or at least being able to explore yourself i reccomend that you take whatever feeling you wanted to express with that poem and see how well you can express it with as few words as possible just write the bare bones of it with no music or technique theres a really good chance itll become musical all on its own
  macron met borges widow when he was in buenos aires so he is /lit/
  probably my best bet my biggest concern will be if i strip away everything to its bare essentials would i still make it intelligible only way to find it is to give it a shot
when in disgrace with fortune and mens eyes  i all alone beweep my outcast state  and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries  and look upon myself and curse my fate  wishing me like to one more rich in hope 5  featured like him like him with friends possessd  desiring this mans art and that mans scope  with what i most enjoy contented least  yet in these thoughts myself almost despising  haply i think on thee and then my state 10  like to the lark at break of day arising  from sullen earth sings hymns at heavens gate  for thy sweet love rememberd such wealth brings  that then i scorn to change my state with kings
  it is always my opinion that you should not be afraid to delete and revise everything all of the time and if you shave it so much that theres nothing left then there was nothing there to begin with
  you know even if this was an original poem by some anon i think id still be annoyed at the archaic language this sonnet really belongs firmly in its context and anyone trying to replicate this style in 2018 is completely misguided
  i like that last line about nothing there to begin with and to tell the truth i do fear that most of my poetry is like that where if i strip it down nothing remains there is much to be done

/lit/ i have been having a very difficult time dealing with specific and persistent emotions coming that i dont understand and while trying to figure out what it is the book of disquiet kept coming up     what i was looking up was saudade mono no aware and sehnsucht the best i can describe the feeling is a painful longing for beauty or longing for something beautiful that is gone     does that sound right does the book of disquiet have this theme or written in a style that evokes this im going to read this book regardless but i really need to understand this feeling and i think the best way would be through art that evokes it are there maybe other works that do this better than the book of disquiet
  i also think i might just be very lonely
just read the book already
no saudade is the pain that you feel when you miss something or someone and you actually want it back its stronger than nostalgia it hurts and it fills your hear it is has a fire challenge you have to go through
  go for romanticism youll dig it
  so its grief  why do yall use funny words
  a filosofía da saudade by ramon piñeiro dont know if its translated though
  yall  out
    no it is not grief or strong nostalgia    saudade is similar but not equal to nostalgia a word that also exists in portuguese    in the book in portugal of 1912 a f g bell writes    the famous saudade of the portuguese is a vague and constant desire for something that does not and probably cannot exist for something other than the present a turning towards the past or towards the future not an active discontent or poignant sadness but an indolent dreaming wistfulness
   but i really need to understand this feeling  objectrelations psychoanalytic writings
i generally detest audiobooks because i dont feel like i absorb as much however as a part of my job i will often spend hours on end forced to stare at a screen and click a button when an interesting signal comes through ive started listening to audiobooks during these times and when i do other menial tasks such as folding laundry and washing dishes     however ive largley depleted the list of books that i think are acceptable to consume in this way i revisted the iliad the odyssey and beowulf all of which solely because they were originally spoken anyways and i loved them yet more this second time through i listened to the adventures of tom sawyer and the adventures of huck finn two childrens classics that i somehow missed out on i listed to some standup comedian books such as stanhopes digging up mother after that i started knocking out a bunch of things that i would otherwise never have read but are nice to at least be able to talk about to casual readers such as andy weirs artemis     the trouble is that because its so easy to consume books this way i feel like im not getting through any good books anymore on the one hand i want to treat any good book with the resect it deserves which is to say that i think i should actually read them and not listen to them but on the other hand i cant take any more crap scifi books like artemis     so /lit/ what do you recommend i listen to so far what i have on my tolistento list is jesmyn wards sing unburied sing another that i likely would not read but whatevs it won a national book award brave new world i figure since this is read by early high schoolers perhaps i wont miss too much by giving it 80 attention am i mistaken lord of the flies the hobbit and the lord of the rings trilogy outside of this i have only books that i dont expect to enjoy very much please give me recs
american gods has a full cast of voice actors and the writing lends itself to the audiobook format highly recommend
doesnt absorb shit from audio    so youre saying you cant absorb a college lecture wow way to expose yourself as a fucking pseud
audiobooks are great for any book you dont necessarily need to fully absorb such as most fiction books or very detailheavy nonfiction where the details are not so important as the overarching concepts a good categoric example of these kinds of nonfiction books are extensive histories on a topic you may already know well enough about such as schirers rise and fall of the third reich i wont need to remember the specific names behind the fall of the weimar republic in order to understand the themes which brought it down but the author goes into those details regardless  see if your local library has an app for audiobooks that you can use to freely peruse books in your favored subjects or genres i find that comedic books are great in audio format due to the delivery of the narrator adding to the flow of the situation or punchline which regular reading may not provide
  thanks for the rec alas ive already read this book and alas it was not my kind of book it is nonetheless something like the type i imagine im looking for       i rate your bait 2/10      thanks for the tips i should have mentioned that im more interested in fiction i read volumes of scientific writing for work so i strongly prefer to read fiction for pleasure comedy and comedic memoirs however are an obvious exception
  you might also enjoy podcasts there are podcasts about philosophy and literature out there as well i also remember there being like a gutenberg but for free audio books but i cant find/remember it now
  99 percent invisible mit podcast new yorker poetry new yorker fiction radiolab the writers voice bbc in our time the truth xlr8r and resident advisor and giant bomb  arts and ideas books and authors private passions the essay and science hour from bbc  also some random podcasts from radiotopia they have good selection
    excellent ideas thank you
will disney be able to do justice to eoin colfers masterwork
  disney cant even do justice to remakes of its own fucking films    its one of the shittiest most soulless production companies out there
no absolutely not     the books are fit for movie adaptation especially the first and second part maybe the fifth too the real problem is bringing the interaction of the core characters to life while keeping to the books artemis himself will be the hardest to portray without introducing extra bullshit scenes to make him look clever    the world wouldnt really improve with another alex rider clone
are those books actually good  and why
i hope they include the scene where butler fucks holly in her tight fairy ass
  i remember reading them but i dont remember anything about them
  theyre shit and owen colfer is a pleb
  can you tell me why
  the author is a libcuck and the story is cultural marxist propaganda
 little afraid to ask but what does that mean   do the books have a lot of propaganda or just sarcasm
  actually the story is fairly realistically so very antimarxist
i was very into these as a kid and remember approximately 0 about them
  i think its because one of the members of the bodyguard families rejected her lineage thats all i can pull out from my memory  also there was a warlock race being manipulated by a warring demagogue if i really rack my memory so i guess he could be inserting fascism into that dynamic
  i mean theyre ya so you cant expect that much but when i read them as a kid i thought they were fucking great and theyre decent morality tales too
  im guessing its because the resolution to nearly all the books is that the main characters succeed because they help each other maybe hes bothered these childrens books dont have a no country for old men dynamic
  xd i dont really think thats marxism  it seems like some fictionfantasy cliche  the author have a no one is illegal shit in his twitter so yeah he is a liberal
my only connection to artemis fowl is that pasta where an anon steals it from a library
  post it
disney has just been way too political lately i anticipate the movie will be heavy on affirmative action and will work in some kind of strong woman message
    they literally made the family of servants to the fowl family black when the family was originally white    and then instead of using the original books strong woman message they made the haven police an equal opportunity work space so holly has nothing to overcome in that regard
  my fucking sides
  kek
  well thats just not on the ball at all
  if you have to ask that means youre also most likely a bluepilled libcuck
  they have been trying to make this movie since before my balls dropped it isnt happening
  they were good books to read as a kid though i remember the plots of the later books being too formulaic and i lost interest after the eternity cube the first one is worth a read if you just need a book to relax with but like  said theyre ya
  isnt happening  they have a trailer out  lol
i read these when i was eight and i will tell you that these books were not only shi and confusing mostly just annoying but just about anyone who has read them or has anything positive to say about them is clearly reddit/pleb/andor too young to post here please leave
  babadda gooble gobble  thats the part of stopped reading that book took me a week to figure out it was about thunder without looking it up
  read these when i was in 3rd grade  mfw that was more than a decade ago  these books kicked ass back then i read the first one again for nostalgia in high school and it sucked dick but its the memories that count  anyway the point of the post was where has the time gone and why has it been so many years since i last was able to enjoy life
  make butler black when he was white  make holly white when she was brown  whats the point of this
  i read aeiouns attempt at a hitchhikers guide sequel and it was one of the biggest affronts to a god dougie never believed in ive ever tried to stomach
  this movie has been in development hell since before obama was president i dont even think colfer released an addition to the series inside of this decade it isnt happening famalam
  hes releasing the twins spinoff soon apparently and if books can continue than movie getting out of development hell isnt that improbable
  i liked it when i was young but now i googled the synopsis and it sounds really dumb
  still less dumb than harry potter
  you know i cant say i remember that one
  reading it right now its dumb in placesthe whole fairy police being really incompetent and artemis tricking holly into thinking he gave her truth serum even though the timeline of events makes no sense but overall its a solid read
  forgetting the best scene
remember a wrinkle in time   yea expect the same garbage
  nah its gonna be a sjwf fest
  i stopped reading after the fourth or fifth book i think also  they made butler black  hard pass my dudes
  its not particularly hard to be less dumb than harry potter

  i dont know  i just dont understand lot of it  havent read dg obviously
  i feel like this is probably well constructed and i just dont get it because i havent read any of those authors

 232  the ultimate foundation of the kantian critical philosophy is a difference drawn between objects and their conditions of possibility items of competent attention are framed in a way that cannot itself be successfully itemized the display frame cannot be displayed confusion between empirical objects and their transcendental conditions of possibility most typically exemplified by the attempt to apprehend the latter as if they were the former is taken to define speculative metaphysics or pure theoretical reason  which is conceived rigorously as a persistent yet futile misapplication of intelligence to pseudoproblems essentially exceeding its capabilities the rest is detail     2321  to objectify the transcendental bases of objectivity for instance in the posing of a metaphysical question about the nature of space time or causality is to lead thought into hopeless error whose symptoms are irresolvable dilemmas contradictions or antinomies the systematic enumeration of these cognitive deadends is the task of transcendental dialectic it was kants contention that such quixotic questions  addressed to the conditions of objectivity as if they were themselves objects  had dominated and fatally distracted philosophy up to his own time the repudiation of such error is at its most elementary  and considered here initially solely in its theoretical employment  the primary product of kantian critique      i agree i understand other parts of cryptocurrent but the semiotic sign dg stuff is over my head by at leats 2 standard deviations    where do i start with dg     antioedipus   thousand plats    any individual essays outside of books

 2322  critique sets limits it also eliminates that is why the critique of metaphysics has been found to be isomorphic with a sociopolitical project of subtraction with an inclination towards anarchism the promotion by satoshi nakamoto of a platform for peertopeer transactions independent of all oversight by trusted third parties is the continuation of critique into electronic networks the same impulse is more widely recognized as disintermediation it complies with the quintessentially modernistic project of immanentization transcendent grounds of authority are identified delimited routedaround obsolesced and finally extirpated modernity as the work of critique produces formal flatness     2323  considered as a positive philosophical discovery the transcendental coincides with the synthetic a priori like all great things in the domain of thought this hybrid concept is quasiparadoxical it denotes a field of nonfactual discovery  a genetic particularity of the universal  at once necessary but nonobvious epitomized by the mathematical theorem synthetic a priori truths are secular revelations contingent in their acquisition but then necessary in their preservation they constitute the sole positive ratchet in the accumulation of knowledge describing an asymmetry  or arrow  proper to epistemology a oneway or unilateral fatality such discoveries are arduously amassed but then invulnerable to dissipation they are in this way indispensable to the comprehension of historical time and can be considered as products of unlimited application the blockchain is exemplary a cryptic or radically nonobvious solution to a problem we will later explore attentively it is  subsequent to its formalization  culturally indispensable it cannot be uninvented this is true to such an extent that it appears as an eternal mathematical fact wholly impervious to the ravages of empirical fortuity to derealize the blockchain would be to unmake the universe or at least to collapse what is  transcendentally or inescapably  for us the universe what is done transcendentally cannot be undone without radical timeviolation the cryptocurrent permits no repudiation the units of synthetic a priori knowledge production are laws in the very strongest defensible sense of this term in which their descent from and simultaneous irreducibility to any particular cases is insisted upon this ratchetstructure makes the synthetic a priori  or some adequate analog  indispensable to any rigorous conceptual decompression of the notion of time    this new cc21 was great

what is it about the silmarillion and jrr tolkien lore in general thats so impressive exactly theyre good stories for sure and the silmarillion reads like the bible or maybe the illiad / the oddesy but everyone seems to say that nothing has or ever will compare to it    how hard could it be to create a fantasy mythos equal or greater than what jrrt did
well /lit/ have you taken the blackpill yet
  i took the blackpill when i was first sexually abused at the age of 9 by a close family member
  thats sucks but that has nothing to do with being blackpilled buddy boi
  then you havent truly taken the blackpill
is blackpilled a newfangled term for falling from grace
  nice digits fuckboi did it influence your adult sexual behaviour in any way
  nice
  im gay but im unsure if thats anything to do with what happened one thing i think it did affect is not acting on sexual urges it makes me feel sick when i start to for example i first went to a gay bar when i was 19 and made out with a guy who i was sexually attracted to but i suddenly felt repulsed and ran out on him he chased me out into the alley and tried to sexually assault me too that sucked
      look in to reichs carachter types for some understanding of how the psyche extends out to executive behavior
  everyone seems to sexually assault you im starting to think youre a fucking tease
  lel
  same but i was a bit older
  i think you mean the neon pill semiotic simulationism just makes deleuzianism that much sexier

  debord
  what the actual fuck i was just reading about this then i go on 4chan and i see this    fucking synchronicities everywhere
  if by blackpill you mean the next in the incessant and indefinite queue of whiny limpdick cryptopedophilic lifedenying parisian nigger lovers then yes     fuck you and fuck boredrilldark
  you seem to have lost your way i hope you know where to go back
  yeah

  best post itt tbhwylit
what the fuck was his problem
  he suffered from being too right that and a surprising lack of dick
vestigial bicameral mind
  too much speed
interesting ideas terrible writing
is exegesis worth reading
  he was a robot and didnt realise it
  amphetamine psychosis and a lifelong desperate with for his life to have some kind of inherent meaning the last part is evident in his writing from the start
i dunno op but i think i have it too
  hes unironically one of the best american writers of the 20th century maybe ever
valis
he did not die he traveled back in time and became karl marx
  no  checked
  he was too based for this world
    post more more more more
he had toxo

at what age does it become embarrassing to visit this board
  all of them
this website in general anything after eighteen i break my own rule for i am years past that
this is the best place on the internet to discuss literature and thats really sad
  you probably blow away your tenth grade literature teacher with all that you learned here
  started at 21 and now at 22 it doesnt bring anything new to the table but im an addict
  /thread
always embarrassing i stopped browsing other boards though and only come here because i have no outlet in real life to talk about literature it may be shit here but its something
  /lit/ is pretty comfy and significantly less of a cesspool than the other boards
  honestly i love the fact that we can discuss complex stuff like gr ulysses phenomenology of the spirit anti oedipus and so on i know most of this stuff thanks to you guys and i love it everywhere else is just harry potter and shit like that kind of like /tv/ but for books so thanks for that i feel like saying i love you all
    /lit/ at its best has better bantz than most of the retards in my phd program its really sad but there really is something to be said for the anonymity of our discussions as its basically impossible to discuss a lot of this shit in actual social contexts without everything devolving into absurd posturing if i were constitutionally capable of anger i would be mad but instead i just want to shoot myself in the face
  in some ways ive been here so long though that its mostly just endless repetition its slowness helps i just need some kind of outlet to talk about literature it sucks not being able to talk about a big part of your life with anyone the other media boards just discuss pop shit that i have plenty of other outlets for which is why i dont go to them anymore
  there are people in their 30s who are currently on 4chan but most people are in their twenties  a small number of these people will unironically never leave  there will one day be old men in their 80s and 90s on this site who have been here since 14
  thinks 4channel is going to last that long
  31 yo here its far sadder to find teenagers and people in their 20s here live your youth discuss literature when youre older lads
  but i dont even know what living my youth even means
  lol just b urself m8
  desu i blew away my high school teachers
  this i used to post way less when i was in my 20s fucking 16yos
  but anon if i browse /lit/ now ill be the ultimate patrician by the time im 30 i am an intellectual and thus have no need of the common hedonistic perception of youth anybody trying to get into literature past their teens is fighting an uphill battle
  i was myself by playing video games and watching anime through my youth cannot recommend
  
  nearly 37 here this really is a place for boomers you kids dont know your ass from your elbow and always with the same simple questions
  this this place is bad but it isnt so bad considering haha everything else    its embarrassing if it is all you do though
  have some adventurous times push some of your limits think less about fucking girls or whatever the mainstream thing to do as a youth is and think more about accumulating experiences   when youre old when your body will start to fail you when death becomes a very real thing its these adventures that will help you face it all   i regret how much time i wasted in my 20s trying to get through to women to get laid some of the best memories i have are sleeping on benches in vienna eastern european here and salonic because i had just a couple euros for food or hosting a canadian dude on couchsurfers and getting shitfaced for a couple of days and talking about how much i hate gypsies and he hates native peoples or ditching my depressing group of friends and just talking to someone new or helping my uncle fell some trees in the countryside/ at the time some of these experiences were uncomfortable annoying shit some seemed quite awful but looking back its these memories i cherish the most
  desu if its still standing by then why not throw in a visit to the local internet wall of text also this  though this place can help you find some decent shit its best to hurry off once youre ready  and the aim is to be ready
  but you will have no frame of reference for the things you want to talk about because you wont really know yourself its by doing by experiencing by feeling the bad weird awkward that you can truly learn how to critique or judge facts feelings and people
  this really sad that some kids might waste the best time of their life on this board
  spent years 20  present posting and the older i get the less i want to interact with the outside world fuck society fuck the masses fuck women and most importantly well you know
  im not leaving because of good reccomendations i mean just last week i found two new books to check out that seem genuinely interesting and creative also without this place i never wouldve discovered unica zürn
  you can live an interesting life and do a lot of fun cool things without interacting with the masses anon dont fall for the depressed recluse meme do now analyze later you wont regret it
  i blew my high school teachers
  my high school teachers blew me and by high school i mean like 2nd or 3rd grade and by blew i mean fingered my ass
44 reportan
but 30 anons i enjoy reading and i enjoy /lit/ and musing on life and all that shit and things like get out there and live now whole you still can just gives me anxiety i think if you just plan ahead like to get an education of something that will earn you money in the future and you pursue that while still living your autonomous lifestyle of chilling at home your home time being that of reflection hobbyingreading for us and internrt addiction your life experiences will come with that goal you pursue such as education or work idk i dont think telling people who are intersted in literature to do something else is good its charming to hear that old people loved reading alot when they were young imo
bump
im 31 and i spend an average of like 5 hours a day in here ama
  do you have a degree in philosophy by any chance
  i have a phd in esoteric hitlerism
  good post
28
  english
  thank you for posting anon
18   this board has been discussing the same topics since i was 16 and it isnt getting any better so adulthood seems like an ideal closing point  yet i keep coming back
    talking about how much i hate gypsies and he hates native peoples     the kekest kekett i got today
  leave anon im in my mid20s and i dont think ive accomplished a single valuable thing since 19 due to my internet addiction
  i felt about the same as you when i was your age im 28 now
    fucking christ this is gonna be me in a handful years i have to get out of here
  im 20 now have accomplished nothing and am about to drop out of college and learn a trade taking the easy way out have tried many times to leave but i lack the willpower but ill keep your message in mind deadeyed anhedonia and /lit/ cant be all there is to life    that is terrifying anon
  i sometimes feel bad that there are people here who really want to dsicuss literature and i derail entire threads by blogposting the worst part is most of the posts are complete fiction i just say things that i think people will react to    it has helped my ability to write characters at least
  blogposting is really nice for those of us who dont get enough human interaction in our own lives please dont stop but maybe keep it out of decent threads
i am mike cernovich and i invite you guys to check out my book maga mindset
  23
  decent threads  its usually some retarded bait about women or something    the best threads seem to be language threads imo and then sometimes philosophy threads    i dont think ive literally ever seen a good thread about ulysses or any of the other meme novels
  you complete queer no one likes me im a horrible prick why do people like you want to convince me that its better to spend time with people repulsed by my presence than at my own leisure
  theyre giving you false advice hoping youll apply it and make negative experiences that eventually result in psychotrauma pretty twisted actually
  life is fucking boring
  tfw this is true besides talking to university/grad students this is all there is
    or instead of seeing it as an invitation for psychotrauma you could see it as an opportunity for improvement i figure that somebody will say changing to suit a degraded society isnt an improvement and ill concede that but if everyone you meet is repulsed by you which im not convinced they are i dont know your selfevaluation skills then most likely theres room for you to develop as a person its not a derogatory remark to say that you have room for improvement and really if youve developed a mode of existence that doesnt align with the mainstream theres still a way to communicate that while adhering to prevailing views of life/socialization if you dont try to meet the people you meet half way then you dont care about changing their views and thats fine continue to live alone but its painful to live that way     i lost sight of my point halfway through that hopefully the gist comes through
  fag  spoiler but also true /spoiler
  18
  but how do i live my youth
  take ket and have make out sessions with strangers in the strobe lights of a club
  based
  30 year old boomer cant tell when the kids are being sardonic or even comprehend youthful preoccupation with belonging
  yeah im trying to like speed that process up so it doesnt fuck them up too badly
  this geser cant follow a train of thought lfaoo
  haha who would do that right spend all their time on /lit/  haha i wouldnt
  by 20 you should have moved on to other deader chans and start spending less time on the internet altogether 4chans too fast and filled with retarded normalfags who think they belong here but really dont and never did and never will
  after 18 and beyond
  it honestly scales with your level of success in life ive told people irl that i browse /lit/ and they think its cool because im a gigachad
  im a gigachad  youre not anon
tfw just passed 13 years of browsing
  sardonic  but i dont like fish anon
  jerk off to online porn games all day long while working a job as a cashier    the frustration of doing something completely idiotic because some random faggot on a korean jaw shavings collectors forum will make for some of the greatest writings mankind has ever read
  11 years here
  this is a sophomore level place so the age the normal university student is no longer a sophomore
  this    i enjoy reading masturbating browsing the internet reflecting on life in my house as a neet watching movies and playing vidya i dont think theres anything wrong with the simple pleasures
im 27 and i am ashamed i post here mostly because i am now spend an enormous amount of time arguing with children
  hugs tehe
  2013 is the correct answer anything beyond some 6 years ago is shameful here we are dregs and afterthoughts comingling in our mediocrity
  27 year old from the greatest generation here i completely agree
    48 here stop calling me a boomer you damn kids
  yeah this
  live your youth  you say that as if its easy to do
  when death becomes a very real thing  you fool death is always a very real thing
  stop not feeling bad for the lives youve taken
  its better here  t 19
  me too sweetie but ive only been here for 35 years     he thinks we will forgive him and his cohort for what they did to the housing market and cost of living    this cause you are a newfag and a tourist like most people posting here hehe
  iktfb
  not a single one of my friends read if i read your average popular fiction i would still be seen as a heavy book reader to them let alone the greek stuff im currently reading
  nah dude fuck being a neet thats not what i meant
  be 31  when youre old  your body will start to fail you  lmao your body is fine for at least another 20 years it you take some care of it
  the only people who dislike 4chan are people who have been isolated here for so long that they have forgotten what most places of discussion look like its unfortunate but this is really as good as socialising gets
  im a gigachad  post dick haircut and stack
i am 34 yo been browsing this shithole for 5 years
  bbut no one else my age reads books
27 here lurker for 7 years  you can shit on lit all you want in the past two years this place has provided more quality discussion and insights than my whole academic background has done so in the meantime
  i started reading philosophy cause of this board without you lads i mightve never given it a thought
  its embarrassing to be below 25 and come here desu
  id rather read blogpost by some pseud here rather than interacting with plebs outside
  you talk like boomer mate
  how would you know this
  hehe d
every age even now i feel embarrassed to make this post desu      humanity will forever remember your generation as the one that fucked up the earth
  what did he do
  i just need some kind of outlet to talk about literature it sucks not being able to talk about a big part of your life with anyone  this i have nowhere else to talk casually about literature everytime i find someone interested in books it always turns out to be some kind of genre fiction or at best completely entry level stuff to the point where theyre still intimidated by dostoevsky
  depends on the thread there are turtles within turtles wheels within wheels /lit/s within /lit/s      you have it backwards in youth your internet addiction is more out of control and you poast more later you have more control keep things to a couple lines t 27 y/old boomer
  this its sad most people are boring to discuss literature with and just regurgitate the same talking points on the same old books  on /lit/ yeah you have to sift through the what book will get me a gf/get over depression threads but also have some comfy casual discussion with people who think somewhat similarly to how you do
  i didnt start reading philosophy because of this board but it did push me into it sooner and make me interested in specific philosophers rather than just the eh i suppose ill try plato one of these days to see what the fuss is attitude i used to have
  only brainlets feel embarrassment for their passion    go on think through your thought i want you to take a breath and believe you came up with a counter argument then read the spoiler    only double brainlets cant tell apart embarrassment and public modesty
  my father is one
    samefagging or is this a common opinion  id genuinely love to know why
  this is the best place to discuss damn near anything and its not sad its incredible 4chans philosophy as a whole is great because its were garbage well never be anything but garbage but heres a few things weve figured out pretty well    no upvotes no identities no posturing no dogma authority is openly mocked and minimized just pure ideas going to war with one another every day this place is very hard to leave
  if i browse /lit/ now ill be the ultimate patrician by the time im 30
  being a young nerd sucks because you go on thinking you are very smart in your quest for knowledge and contentment only to find the best way to enjoy life was to be a dumb jock in youth
  but anon if i browse /lit/ now ill be the ultimate patrician by the time im 30
  lol
  magyar vagy
  but anon if i browse /lit/ now ill be the ultimate patrician by the time im 30
  this you should misspend your youth getting drunk and smoking weed with your friends going on road trips and holidays finally at the age of 25 you can settle down to 1100 bedtimes when hangovers get too bad and spend your evenings browsing /lit/  the goal of your youth is to do enough fun shit to not turn into a bitter old man leave /lit/ and come back wen youre in your mid 20s    dont waste your youth on 4chan it will go by so quickly one minute youre 18 before you know it youre 25 it goes by so fast
just chiming in to say that you faggots are fucking here forever
  this cause you are a newfag a  2012 on lit 2007 on 4chan  god why am i still here
  it depends on what you post if youre 70 and posting /b/ tier shit then thats embarrassing but if youre 70 and making well thought out posts and contributing to discussions then theres nothing wrong with that
  expecting people to take everything more seriously as they grow older    im glad im not your friend
  theres a lot of posturing here too
  but then i can call you a faggot and get away with it so
  pplease dont make me grow up and have adult opinions and habits  its okay i dont befriend manchildren
  think of a country that you probably hate and they took something from you in 1918 magyar bro
perusing the thread it looks like i win so far  just turned 51 i unironically found my way to /v/ and then /pol/ on account of gamergate  stewed there for a while and then made my way to /k/ and now split my time on /k/ /lit/ and /int/ its kind of ironic because i dont even play vidya anymore  it was just an interesting topic for me on account of how it all evolved
have some adventurous times push some of your limits think less about fucking girls or whatever the mainstream thing to do as a youth  as if having adventurous times wouldnt be a good recipe for pussy youre just playing down pussy to cope with your lacking past but okay
  4chan is not the right place to assert your maturity
  any advice on how to get laid
  dont become a wizard
have you even read the sequel anon
is there a book that sums up the cultural differences between 4chan and 4channel
ive yet to see any notable difference     keep dreaming
  ive been gone for like nine months somebody give me a quick rundown
  are you blind
porn boards are usually filled with complete normalfags its even worse than here
  theyre not telling the truth in there anon
  explain
  my diary desu
  whats going on
lord of the flies
is chink moot prepping this sight for sale     4chan can be deleted as far as im concerned
  deleting 4chan would be a net positive for /lit/ yet i wouldnt want it to be deleted the internet would not be as fun without them
it reminds me very very vaguely of the cult in 1q84
  4chan stopped being wacky and fun like 12 years ago it has for many years been a bizarre testimony of the myserious darkness which resides close to the core of human persons though it achieves that testimony only through an even stranger veil of humor the memes let a darkness speak but can never name it as darkness
should i read the capitalism and schizophrenia series first or dr and logic of sense first which one is more accessible
  if you want accessible read his work on neitszche and bergson
just read his best work
  fpbp      second post bad post
  jump right into nietzsche  philosophy and work from there have some pasta      deleuze is a matter of quantity in the sense that you want as much information on him as possible for things to make sense reading him no matter how well read you may be philosophically is not enough but you can read or listen to others such as delanda for ds connections to science and maths to get a more complete picture    a decent short summary / intro to dg          a lot of the stuff here      everything by manuel delanda      a bit more on the nietzschedeleuze relation through klossowski who dedicated his book about nietzsche to deleuze      more on the deleuzenietzsche relation the entire series is fascinating if youre into nietzsche        the deleuze for the desperate series      derridas lecture about deleuze mistitled its about stupidity not forgiveness      theres probably a lot more there are vimeo videos as well which dont feature on youtube    pirate deleuzes abecedaire it should have english subtitles as i cant find it streamed in full online anywhere    as for the books start with the essay and interview collections in no particular order dialogues negotiations desert islands two regimes of madness essays critical and clinical letter to a harsh critic in negotiations is short about 7 pages and tells you how to read his texts as for the books start with nietzsche and philosophy read the intro to the english translation by michael hardt even if you dont read the book in english deleuzes courses are also pretty accessible and translated in several languages       a decent bibliography  
  pirate deleuzes abecedaire  there arent good english subtitles at least none that i could find  you can read a summarized version of it here  
      john david ebert has summaries of a few deleuze books
    bretty gud
if youre ever bored just punch a deluzian what are they gonna do tell their parents

why do people think its okay to follow religious scripture that doesnt rhyme
taking a class on creative writing next year    have to read  the lord of the rings  game of thrones  the once and future king  harry potter  before class starts    during the class have to read  kushiels dart  expiration date  his majestys dragon  the mists of avalon  the sandman vol 2 the dolls house  the tough guide to fantasyland    most of the books are shit plus they are bricks im being forced to take this class aswell not sure i can even physically read all 7 harry potter books
why do you have to make lies op
 making you read 30000 pages for one class    im so glad i did stem
  what school requires you to read that much before the class even begins  i assume that you mean the entire series of each of those titles you listed  it seems to be that it would be sufficient to just read the first book of each if you were looking to contrast different styles
    source on picture
read a chapter or two from each to pick up the style then read the wikipedia summaries to get the gist of the plot
creative writing   that was your first mistake
  anon this is not true
  looks like fan art if you zoom in on the map you can see that all the names are from different video game places
  read the syllabus instead
  i actually dropped out of university two years in because of all the shitty books we had to read no regrets
lol creative writing doesnt mean generic fantasy
  well done your larping upset me my blood began boiling not halfway down your list
  the sandman vol 2 the dolls house s actually good
what is some great literature fiction or literary nonfiction on depression/anxiety/isolation not stuff that seeks to cure or worsen the symptoms but honest reflections of what makes people feel the way they do

what do you do when you really want to get into a book/series but the writing is just so juvenile
  i power through and i give it 3 stars on goodreads
just let your eyes glaze over and turn the pages thats how i got through proust
do the warhammer lorewriters read hieroglyphs
  nothey are just edgy boomers
listen to the audiobook as i do menial shit i wouldnt dare read a physical 40k book for an hour waste of time but its campy enough to take your mind off things while you do other stuff
not reading horus heresy
  its a book based on the fluff text for a board game what were you expecting
  is it worth it to read past the third novel
  yes i enjoyed them at least you can skip descent of angels since its kind of a non sequitur and the first half is not that great
  i was told the second novel is basically just a list of commands rather than an actual story can i skip the second
  i didnt get that feeling from it i liked it the first 3 are all essential for the story and cant be skipped
  i want to skip all the way to mechanicum just because i like the cover art
  you download the audio book and listen to it when walking around etc no time wasted
  if you want to read things out of order theres a flow chart of plot arcs you can follow
read all of the horus heresy you will not regret it and it will grant a 5 bonus to testosterone levels for every book in the series that you read    good luck and may the light of evropa shine down upon you

zero books    shoulda known retard
  /thread
  is that a comment on the quality of the publishing house or a more obvious reference to the zero books in their name
hes surprised that something published by zero books is trash
        where were all you fucktards in the fisher threads everyone seemed to be praising this book as deep and profound were you all trolling
  on baudrillard and his readership    ultimately baudrillard is a sociologist not a writer of political action or whichever other prescriptive ethics this is also true of many of his epigones readers and imitators expecting a solution from a baudrillard a bauman a žižek or whoever else that writes mass produced 100150 page booklets belonging to this fad in contemporary continental philosophy that i like to call sociology as first philosophy is an exercise in futility    again these guys concern is to tell you in painstaking detail their reading of how in late capitalism society is ruining society not what a first worlder subject can do about it oh and coming up with the next cool famous neologism that everybody in this genre of nonfiction literature is going to use henceforth    on movie references as replacement for ideas    their strategy to get rid of the spectacle is to have the spectacle think for them and accelerate the sales of popcorn  they will never admit to themselves that they rely on screenplay writers to do the job for them because the selection process towards being a successful name in hollywood is harder than becoming one of the sociology as first philosophy crowd  said crowd tries to hide the fact that it is presently progressing towards a pop culture as first philosophy stage  when their language is done drowning in memes manufactured by the media their 150page booklets on how society is ruining society will be indistinguishable from threads wholly dedicated to baneposting
  now zero books is a company that lives up to its name by printing said mass produced drivel
  i like your analysis here what works do you recommend as alternatives to the meme philosophers you named
  collected works of marx engels and lenin  postmarxism is shit desu
  i read the communist mainfesto it didnt seem to give any better solutions to capitalism than these meme philosophers
  memed
here op get and read this it will help you understand better what you read in fishers book
  off the top of my head    cornelius castoriadis for the prescription as for the description you find much better stuff in  henri lefebvre  karel kosík   giorgio agamben  david harvey  fredric jameson    reminder to read heidegger before any more recent continental thinker
  thanks what works by david harvey would you recommend does he deal at any length with the creation of regional identities
  do you have a blog i can follow    unironically impressed by your fresh takes
  citing walle to support your anticapitalist argument    yikes
  no this book is good   doesnt it make sense that as a society that is entirely assembled from pop culture that in order to write critique it has to happen within that space       this is a good book
  anticapitalist 888ing about capitalism  hard pass
  i think that that is pasta anon as im almost positive ive seen that critique here before multiple times
its called zero books because you have to have a 0 iq to think anything they publish is worth reading
  feeling pretty ripped off right now  its happen to me quite a bit and ive started treating book covers like youtube thumbnails somestimes we get exactly what we expect and other times its hopeful clickbait
  this pasta is a great pleb filter
i always heard strong recommendations of fisher from those i spoke with granted my understanding of philosophy is surface level at best but whats so bad about this work
  his most famous work is social justice and the city but justice nature and the geography of difference and spaces of global capitalism a theory of uneven geographical development are probably something close to answering your latter question    meanwhile read pic related 
capitalism is based on the free market corporate welfare lobbying bailouts central banking patents subsidies  none of these are the free market    the system which oppresses the masses cannot rightfully be labelled capitalism    the culture of materialism commercialism these cannot rightfully be labeled capitalism because capitalism is an economic theory based on the principles of free markets    i am making this distinction so capitalism cannot lazily be used as a catchall when men vilify capitalism they may as well shout for the removal of their economic liberties
  its not real capitalism reeeee
(((zero))) books
  communist manifesto  a literal pamphlet jesus read something else from marx and engels
  sounds like the logic of a cult or ponzi scheme 2bh
  whats wrong with the wandering who    related i have a friend who published under zero books and he has nothing but negative things to say about them
  888ing  
  capitalism is an economic system where capital is controlled by a minority thats it it can be freemarket capitalism or socdem capitalism its about the allocation of resources not the mechanisms or rights people have
    capitalism is bad because x y z  x y and z arent part of capitalism  well let me change the definition of capitalism so it includes them
  if most of the money was being hoarded by a small number of government elite and the means of production were socialized this would not be called capitalism therefore the definition you gave was false
  dont even bother a devout communist will never provide a rigorous definition of capitalism and will disregard any definition given
  its a quick read some parts are boring but some are good the way he talks about weak contrapoints to capitalism being commoditization and really just an argument for accelerationism instead     that said have you ever watched one of the 1h youtube videos with fisher a death man could tell hes severely poor and depressed and is gonna kill himself
  that said have you ever watched one of the 1h youtube videos with fisher a death man could tell hes severely poor and depressed and is gonna kill himself    idk he just looks like a typical neurotic british poofter to me
paying for anticapitalist literature    lmaoingur life
  who gives a fuck if one did pay for it the money would fund a leftist publishing company
    the 19th century has nevertheless come and gone and nowadays we can speak of complex systems presenting emergence for what they really are capitalism in general as a relation of its economic principles to society is a complex phenomenon as much as our perception of conscience worded like this so people who just read the ego tunnel wont get triggered or ant colonies it behaves in ways that cannot be atomized because many of its properties are purely collective effects nonlinear ones to make things even worse    calling the relation of capitalism as an economic system to the rest of the human systems by capitalism is enough for people to understand today because as marx allegedly pointed out himself voila most other systems have either been supplanted or absorbed into the economical anyways in fact all the examples you gave such as corporate welfare bailouts central banking patents subsidies and more must fall under capitalism unless you want to claim we do not live in a capitalist economic system if you dont want to make this bold claim you can make the weaker one that is even harder to defend  that we practice capitalism as an economical system but somehow it does not influence our politics concentration of wealth in even free markets is not surprising to statisticians either as it is a very common feature of competitive predatorprey preyprey predatorpredator dynamical systems both with and without constraints that populations and resources cluster up for many many different initial conditions wed actually have won a jackpot to live in a society tm that was fair enough for enough time without the need to carefully tailor regulations to this end
  fund a leftist publishing company    sounds awful desu
  commie doggo poster    cringe and bluepilled
  in fact all the examples you gave such as corporate welfare bailouts central banking patents subsidies and more must fall under capitalism unless you want to claim we do not live in a capitalist economic system    does the american system purely represent theory isms cannot become convoluted with the corrupt policies of states america is a mixedmarket economy somewhere on a scale between capitalist and government regulated
  capitalism is the only economic system where people pay for things
  seriously who makes these i wanna know i wanna know if its a conglomerate of fucktards that have through a higher plane of sheer asinine interconnectedness banded together to keep the meme alive or if its one twisted fuck who deserves this place the first couple ones were funny and harmless then after a while one has to wonder what the fuck is going on in the minds of these sick degenerates now not only has my personal tolerance far been more than drowned out but the state of this sitewide meme phenomenon has permanently been altered for the worse if it has taken you this long to still be supporting this shallowpate meme without noticing how allbutshit it is then i have nothing else to say
  this meme is capitalist realism in action
  fisher himself ends up being a capitalist realist which precisely why hes searching for alternatives to marxist models of socialism that dont ultimately break from capitalism
  so is he a succdem or some basic bitch shit like that
  wealth is collected in the hands of elites under all models i see your points clearly but theyre moot as all systems are flawed fundamentally capitalism is a failed project but it gives me the most value and life quality right now even if its heading for disaster     read machiavelli and stop being a faggot learn that the future is gone and live for now
  i read 30 pages of marx and he didnt solve all of capitalisms problems  he does that in a different set of pages  sounds like a cult
  lol what ive never read him he ends up being a capitalist     even american lefties look at regulated capitalism like its the new socialism the left really did get destroyed
  castoriadis is terrible    when will you bourgeois larpers realize that you cant combine freud with marx
  p e a k i d e o l o g y
when a book has a question as its title its usually a sign that its going to be bad
  has any of you guys seen the youtube channel by the publisher behind zero books hes so damn proud of the drivel he spews that is just a hidden commercial to sell his bullshit books  is this what neocapitalism has got to /lit/
  imagine writing a book that you need another book to read wtf
  good point
  calling the relation of capitalism as an economic system to the rest of the human systems by capitalism is enough for people to understand today because as marx allegedly pointed out himself voila most other systems have either been supplanted or absorbed into the economical anyways    this sentence doesnt make sense
  blame the man not the puck
  this guy hasnt read gramsci
  the free market always essentially leads to monopoly or economic subjugation the free market has too many internal contradictions
  you cant solve the issue of surplus value by decentralizing markets youre still going to create a class of property owning expropriaters
  fuck meme thinkers read david harvey and frederic jameson  give yourself a hard look in the mirror mate      realize there is nothing to anything fuck bitches get money  you havent read machiavelli      i dont actually read books i just read what other people say about books to save time    this is such a nonthought and whats worse it suggests that you view thinking as some kind of sorcery what does combine even mean because it isnt a precise function you dolt also its very clear you dont know anything about castoriadis thought    all of you should go away and not come back til you have at the very least read croce
  fuck meme thinkers read david harvey and frederic jameson  its the best anglos have give them a break
  cant distinguish between a citation and an illustrative example    just sad really that the reading ability on this board reaches such troughs
  its pertinent and apt for the times in fact but its leftist and thus shat on without trial here    give it a read its only 100pp
  good post anon gl against the hordes
  what an insightful addition to the thread thanks
  just reading anticapitalist literature is laughable in itself    what a huge waste of time
  what is state capitalism
  an oxymoron
  surplus value is the idea that workers create value beyond what they are paid in wages that they are being exploited    however workers do not create value they are valued what the market thinks they deserve
  surplus value doesnt exist so its a moot point
  youre no better than the communists who say but thats not real communism the fact of the matter is that laissezfaire capitalism what youve chosen to call real capitalism is a fantasy it has never existed and where it has come close to being realized it has failed swallowing itself whole lobbying subsidies corporate welfare etc exist because capitalists are trying to protect themselves from the free market and thats always the case free market capitalism is incompatible with human nature
  lobbying subsidies corporate welfare etc exist because the government lacks the integrity adhere to the tenets of free market capitalism purely if businessmen are willing to cheat they cannot subvert the freedom of the marketplace legally without the help of the government     i did not condemn communism or ever claim it was purely practiced i merely attempted to define the term capitalism which is used so loosely that it means whatever in truth its theory not the real world and it means an economic and political system in which a countrys trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit rather than by the state
how to realistcally get rid of capitalism most leftys are to pussy for the violent shit and voting it away just seems laughable activism kek
  complete ecological collapse
  dude humanity will defintely work together when shit actually hits the fan    wew lad
  dude misparaphrasing lmao
the first four or five chapters are very insightful and offer a unique perspective i felt that the last few chapters didnt live up to the previous
    pretty much     i cant really see us changing our ways in time
  accelerationism is literally the only viable option if you could even consider it one capitalism/change needs to come naturally over a long period because things like revolutions never work compare tsarist russia to the soviet union for instance both were authoritarian corrupt didnt care about the serfs/working class and sent people to serbia if they disagreed same goes for the french and america revolutions show me one revolution that actually changed some things
could someone define communism its too abstract for me if you can explain it simply you understand it well enough
  from each according to his fuckability  to each according to his sneed
  capitalism seems to have your balls in its handbag you should probably ask for them back

  i dont actually read books i just read what other people say about books to save time  lmao at least that guy could spell the name of the author he claimed to have read youre worse than a pseud
the first four months of the year will focus on realist fiction id like to begin with russian literature dedicating six weeks each to anna karenina and crime and punishment undecided how the following month will be allocated but id like to leave it open for now in case we fall behind schedule    the next four months coinciding with summer break for those of you who are still students will be tolkienbased that is well begin by reading tolkien discussing the mythology and other elements the author drafts into his argument then explore the influence tolkien has had on modern writers well begin with the lord of the rings alongside the silmarillion alternating between the two and end by burning george rr martins novels in homemade funeral pyres    the final four months will be dedicated to short stories with two months dedicated to american authors and two months dedicated to european reading load will be around one story or author per week

  nothing can be done to stop the decline of all things in the kali yuga    but seriously the internet is having a vast and terrible effect on human knowledge which has only just begun and the results are as much observable in these new /lit/ posters as in pizzagate the cultural marxism boogeyman meme and the rise of jordan peterson     im surprised there doesnt seem to be more being written about this being able to google information has the inevitable effect of decreasing quality of knowledge while increasing peoples sense of their own knowledge    wikipedia is actually evil    inb4 froggies that want to yell at me about politics i wont talk to you save your bait
    but without the internet you couldnt stir up twitter lynchmobs to bully people over political incorrect faux pas cant virtue signal without the net my dude

  unable to identify which is the virgin and which is the beta because they are so far outside the dominance hierarchy    the moral of the story is the /lit/ was the virgin the whole time
  yyou too
  i know a guy who did his book report in grade 8 on minecraft the game no books were made yet no idea how he got away with it
imyplying captain underpants isnt a patrician postmodern analysis of postcapitalism anomie in a wagnerian context
  some guy in my english class wrote a three page poem about the sniper from tf2 and read it outloud in class wish i had it
  im glad i remember the whole situation so vividly he failed to read the book he said he would because it was he was reading it on a knockoff mp3 player with a tiny screen maybe 10 or so words displayed at once when he actually did the presentation he acted out spawning on a beach in minecraft and being confused about a block world and having to punch trees shit was surreal
    ah yes the big boys who read big literature when they were 12

  name one good book written by a womani dare you to tryyou literally cant
  atlas shrugged
women have no sense of the transcendent their minds literally lack the kantian category of transcendence     also their lives are cushy as fuck in general so even if they had some theoretical ability to awaken or grow a category of the transcendent they wouldnt anyway because their everyday temporal life is so interesting and cushy that it would rot even the soul of a plato or nietzsche and turn him into a braindead hedonist posting selfies on twitter    its really a double whammy not only can they not understand metaphysics science or god they would never have a desire to even if they could theyre sort of like those rats in the experiments where the rat can just keep pushing the button that dispenses a treat until its completely fat and dies why would the rat do anything else relative to your consciousness a woman is basically on naturally occurring mdma shes bathing in positive emotions and pleasures nonstop you cant even imagine what its like to be them
  cringe
  because nature made women exclusively for chads to fuck them in their holes

genuine question here has any literature or i suppose storytelling medium of any form other than video game ever used a similar plot to the original league of legends premise for those of you who dont know in the simplest terms the characters in the game are legendary heroes being controlled by powerful wizards the players in simulation sportstype matches to resolve political disputes so instead of the world actually being at war the war institute stages a match between the contending sides and the winner gets land political agreement whatever they are fighting over    all of this has since been retconned and yes i know league of legends lore is beyond shit yes the game kinda sucks yes video games suck im just curious of this premise has ever been used a proxy war game in the place of real militarized conflict in order to create some sort of warless merit based utopia it seems simple and obvious enough but i cant think of any examples    apparently riot retconned the concept because it was too limiting for storytelling lol is not a game that is played for its story of course but i dont know i feel like it is an interesting concept and i want to know more about it or things like it

  uh i want to say yes but im not sure which  i feel like that gamer movie from a couple of years ago must have been based on a book
  for those of you who dont know in the simplest terms the characters in the game are legendary heroes being controlled by powerful wizards the players in simulation sportstype matches to resolve political disputes  slowpoke dot jay peg    they revamped the lore into many different narratives
  read literally the next paragraph that was the original premise which has since been retconned i even said it in the second sentence the original premise

  enders game
  close but not exact fighting in simulations ostensibly as practice for a real battle which are then revealed to have been real battles as opposed to violence free simulations serving as the field of conflict in lieu of actual battle

  youre probably better off searching for a manga
  grand central arena by ryk e spoor  look up books similar to that its probably close enough to what your looking for
have you ever wondered   if people at the end of 19th considered their age immoral they thought art was gone etc  what would they think about us   symbolism decadent movement aestheticism  arent we living in the nightmares of dead artists
  yes they did but you hear that kind of complaints since antiquity people are just pissycunts they like to complain literary people even more so    what would they think about us     some mix of scorn disgust terror amazement and legitimate wonder depending on the artist they were not all the same you know    arent we living in the nightmares of dead artists    were living our own nightmares as we have always been like our sumerians ancestors there is only one epoch in the past 5500 years of human history and it slowly changes without breaking
yes there was a moral panic around the 19th century about society becoming immoral or degenerate if you well you may learned of a few of the results in history class
    yes for the most part i would say so whatever was going on in the collective unconscious to influence artists the past centuries has diminished for us in some respect however i theorize that its simply a matter of people finding new things to tap into and building from there there cant be another illiad wasteland divine comedy or what have you because whatever muses fueling those sorts of ideas have been utilized to great extents already the trick today is to find the new muses recycle old archetypes are make something fresh just look at artists like death grips or aphex twin these things couldnt have existed in the 19th century but theyre brilliant today because theyre from a school of innovators we cant worry about making high modernist or romantic art anymore and we cant compare ourselves to them in a holistic sense but rather what can we procure from the postmodern zeitgest and make brilliant
  is it possible that everyone complaining has been right all along and things truly have gotten worse over thousands of years
i have an impression that we can see a real degradation at present  a degradation of quality of culture due to its ongoing massification
  just look at artists like death grips or aphex twin  of all the ones you could have mentioned
  19th century  ah yes
shut up wyndham lewis youre dead now too
  there was nothing wrong with burning hirschfelds books and shutting down his institution for sexual research
  funny looking dog
  yes they did but you hear that kind of complaints since antiquity  but they were right societies have gotten stronger and stronger over the years but humans are getting weaker and weaker
  i love the rumour that they burnt it first because besides hirschfeld the other people really into same sex nudism and special uniforms were the nazis and people presumed the nazis wanted to burn their own files as they now regretted helping with the research
depressing times
  everyone said it therefore its wrong  what sort of logic is that
  its a lot different now infinity artistically incapable nonwhites werent being imported into their countries at replacement levels there are different priorities now

people assume their angst is due to adjusting to the new becoming but i think it is in response to living with the corpse of the dying and their own corpseinbecoming people often mistake the consequence for the cause as nietzsche said conservatism is disgusting and antilife
  like who
  sadly the post wasnt angry interesting or comically contrarian enough to be lewis
  its caused by liberalism art is always curated by an elite in the past this was the church or aristocracy now its professors the cia and jews on the boards of literary magazines the latter just has poor taste
  fuck that was good i might use a derivative of that in a book
  kraftwerk
    sure thing romans werent right when they suspected their empire was going downhill same thing with the greeks before them
  but is it always like that  or have we fianally reached the point when culture and art are more or less disappearing by this i dont mean  changing their form
  im not really all against literally everything new like some sort of ammish incel but i really feel some sort of nostalgia or sadness for things i never experienced i think that art was generally better and things were intellectually more powerful for everyone before mass media so the 19th and early 20th centuries were really the pinacle of our collective civilization

ugh music was so much better in the age of bach and mozart  ugh look at these ugly heaps of buildings today rococo was so much more beautiful  skirts above the ankle hideous women have no decency these days  dark souls what a contemptible game super mario world is a real video game  television youre rotting your brain read a newspaper  a newspaper youre rotting your brain read a book  a book youre rotting your brain memorize things    its old people being left behind by new styles and cultures this has been going on for millennia
  you should watch midnight in paris
  times of religious decline and increasing wealth were always associated with decadence as much in the 19th century as in the roman empire as today
  perhaps things have been getting shittier for millennia
  i doubt anyone would be arrogant enough to use the term dead art without being lewis you pale imposter
do you think that it might feel that way because only the good stuff survived because that was all that was worth preserving like white noise looks like its going to stand the test of time and be around a long time because its becoming more and more relatable books like hunger games which was a million times more popular wont     so in a hundred years people wont know about it but they will know about white noise still the same thing probably happened to the garbage that was popular 100 years ago
  i think it has a lot to do with us straying further and further from the lifestyle that we actually adapted to
  people in the 19th century didnt know dick about shit who cares
theres nothing at all
  jesus what banality nightmarish infuckingdeed

  arent we living in the nightmares of dead artists  nah mate this is all as stale as real waking life nowhere near a nightmare dont dramatise everything like a 19th century sissy writer
  did neetzsche ever consider that life is gay he takes it as an axiom that it isnt      yes provided you dont conflate technological progress with human progress

  question why the hell are we turning a board on literature into /pol
  nothing in the op has anything to do with politics so what are you talking about
  how can someone longing for higher art be /pol/
  op why did you choose such a painting called decadent girl  you very well know about decadent literature and you create a thread like this cultural decline   you are looking for a specific kind of post to be made one you can identify with you looking for someone and couldnt care less about all the other people here posting their idle opinions about their oh so sorry 21st century society collapsing you want something old like 19th century old  there is a purpose behind every action and you didnt conceil it well enough here obviously you are looking so you had to make the first step and go out on a limb stick your neck out but any firther step i will be there right beside you dont pretend you jsut want to read les fleurs du mal and then go seperate ways you sick fuck i know you kinds  wearing mask and all ive seen some of your films
  im not disgusted by todays immorality im only sad that this immorality does not have any taste is superficial and thoughtless
  you hear this shitty argument all the time and it doesnt make sense first of all the fact that people way back when made similar complaints doesnt a mean they were right or wrong and b doesnt mean were right or wrong in fact it doesnt mean anything it is wholly irrelevant secondly its not like history and culture is some global interconnected continuum that has only ever been moving in one direction its entirely possible that things have gotten better in certain places at certain times and that things have gotten worse in certain places at certain times
  this white people feeling uncomfortable  the end is nigh
  artistically incapable nonwhites  my man never listened to jazz
  but theyre brilliant  just the thought of you being an actual person that exists genuinely makes me laugh at loud
the consistency of a certain complaint over time only strengthens the suggestion that there must be something to that complaint  i dont know why people act as if a lot of people saying the same thing through the ages somehow discredits what they were saying
yes read spengler anyone who attempts to discuss civilization/culture without mentioning spengler is either ill informed or disingenuous he was literally 100 right and we are living in the winter of faustian civilization its decline formally began with the enlightenment and the french revolution
old people have always hated the youth and people have always though their civilization was on decline truth is nothing has changed in the last thousands of years only technology
  or maybe weve been in a state of steady and continuous decline since then and all the people complaining were right from 1925 to the present day
  because the complaints were always its the end of the days tier shit but here we are shitposting away you must think highly of yourself if you believe this time surely we will descend into full retardation and never recover
  not really
  he thinks scared and confused old people have only existed since 1925
ha ha ha whats the matter faggot dont you like big macs and spiderman what could the past possibly have that the future doesnt thats why its called progress duh i cant wait to have even more material comforts in the future haha we /atomized/ now
  this is patently absurd because rather a lot has changed in the last thousands of years and modern technology is itself a product of social political and economic changes that originated in europe in the early modern period
  nontrads owned epic style xd
                      what motivates the status quo shill sugary cereals taco trucks over a century of the compounded effects of a prussian school system whose power to replace the family has been harnessed to emotionally retard generations of consumer whores
  i always hear a lot of people saying that the prussian education system was what started the turning people into consumerist husks but is it really that true where can i learn more about this or is this just a cope for trying to find what to blame
  thats a pige you retard
me on the left
    my take is that theres always at least a low burn of decadence among the welltodos in society as long as theres enough structure/wealth to consider it a cohesive society when the general masses esp the middle class has enough affluence and can start to induldge in that same decadence then it starts to trickle down through the whole society if theres no counterforce and erode social mores eventually without mitigating outside factors a war richer neighbor states exploiting you one of those decadence crests will happen when there isnt enough of a counterforce religious dogma roman republican sentiment traditionalism totalitarian force whatever and the unifying mores of the society will start to degrade less people buy into the essential collective narrative and become estranged from those around them poverty social problems increase center cannot hold blah blah blah its inevitable nothing lasts forever    but because there are crests and valleys not everyone is blanket wrong or right about things being better in the past a patrician living under augustus lamenting the last days of the republic was probably wrong one living under nero would be right

  actually way more people should be making romantic art right now a return to romanticism is exactly what we need postmodernism is honestly gay
people have been saying were in decline forever which means nothing has ever changed ever its literally the same     declinists btfo

  i think theres a subtle difference between a decline in progress and a decline in the quality of culture
  death or glory
  just look at artists like death grips or aphex twin  if your post was like driving on a highway this is the moment where the car spontaneously combusts      a return to romanticism is exactly what we need  we cant return into past except as larping

  i think we are currently in a decline desu after ww2 everything was going well populations boomed economies developed and this allowed people to become degenerate hippies and we are currently living in the aftermath of the degenerate hippy decline there will be some big collapse or change in the status quo after which everything will start to improve again until people again have it good and throw it all away for more comfort

  read them if you live in a city wake up earlier in the morning hop on the first stop of the train and read all the way until the last stop it personally helps me focus and its where i get a lot of my reading done
start writing  think its the best thing ever  start finding plot holes and inconsistencies in character motivation all the time  few days later decide its a shit idea anyway and start something else

    to truly appreciate how tao lin changed megan boyles vagina one must appreciate the incredible endurance and stamina lin brings to the bedroom where average males deliver a hundred to two hundred thrusts per copulation tao lin exceeds 10000 in around a half hour period megan boyles beef never had a chance her dainty veal slices were transformed by the hot crucible of lins locomotive hips pummeling and drubbing and smashing her beef until it grew as swollen and gnarled as a wrestlers ear lin must have marveled over time as he watched her beef blossom with each subsequent sexcapade until megan was bashful about shorts and skirts and came to prefer yoga pants which allowed her to tape and tuck her vajayjay jerky like an earth boring machine grinding bedrock lin bored into boyle to free her from herself to give her the aesthetic charms of a wounded war veteran megan would grow to love her beef to be proud of it she liked that tao had made the beef that it was his muscular jackhammering that turned her bushy peach into a frizzyheaded split pomegranate
bump for based tao
  go to bed tao
  i love you tao
    nice one punchy
i live in nyc and i always wonder if i may stumble across tao      come out bud
  he moved to jersey with his qt azn gf
being a newfag in lit last 23 years makes me really wonder how big tao was in this place at his peak
  ywn tell tao to go to bed
  everyone who lives in nyc secretly lives in nj dont blow us up k thx
    does anyone have a screenshot of tao lins fetlife profile i think he made it extra spicy for artistic reasons owing to his exceptional iq
  he was on par with dostoevsky as far as how much he was talked about in 20112014 taipei was huge
feels like tao had deleted everything about him from the internet
    this is something a highschool writer would find really clever before thinking about it for a few seconds and realizing that love is not like the loch ness monster and deleting it
    incidentally these pictures are extremely spooky
  hes still got nothing on the goat    i wanted so badly to lie down next to her on the couch to wrap my arms around her and sleep not fuck like in those movies not even have sex just sleep together in the most innocent sense of the phrase but i lacked the courage and she had a boyfriend and i was gawky and she was gorgeous and i was hopelessly boring and she was endlessly fascinating so i walked back to my room and collapsed on the bottom bunk thinking that if people were rain i was drizzle and she was hurricane
  bunk thinking that if people were rain i was drizzle and she was hurricane    nah green  is just a cuck tao is actually kinda fascinating with his internet marketing shaneningans and his unique prose
  i get this reference haha
is it normal to plan how you want your poem to start and end what type of language you want to use etc before starting actually write it
  ffs i just realised that im so tired that what i write barely makes sense
  no i have literally no idea what is going to come out my hands just move on the paper or screen and retarded bullshit pours out
pope would first write a prose sketch
  yeah but who gives a shit about pope
    yes its quite normal yeats made prose sketches of his poems before he started to versify them and even lists of rhymes    if you search for original manuscripts of poems you will see just how much work went into them blakes manuscript of the tiger is a wilderness of corrections     emily dickinson sometimes left open spaces even in finished manuscripts of her poems while she awaited for the right word to come    the kind of poem you are writing and the techniques you use also may determine how much effort you put on it if its rhymed poetry you probably will need more effort than with blank verse    sketching is very normal and in the end all that matters is the final result
no when writing his sugared sonnets shakespeare hadnt a clue that each one was going to be in iambic pentameter consisting of four quatrains followed by a rhyming couplet he went in completely fresh and blind for each one
i dont write poetry because im not a faggot but for actual poets i think it depends on the type of poetry they write someone like trakl seems to just freely associate while milton for instance seems to have sit for hours over every single line i think the difference lies in whether its an introverted or extroverted poem for a lack of better terms
  i like this guys aesthetic also it depends on the length
i do exactly the same
i dont think i just write
books with this feel
  my diary     i havent cried in half a decade
  i have no mouth and i must scream
  i try to regular rehearse crying atleast once every two weeks usually on weekends so that im prepared for when a family member or friend dies before i started this tradition i used to have regular nightmares of being at my dads funeral and not being able to force a single tear out and everyone was calling me a monster or a robot for it    anyways stoner is the answer as usual op

read evola  start shitting in the street and believing i can conjure up gold by drawing snakes on the floor  you tell me
  no he fought for the french foreign legion as a teen was a lieutenant in the wehrmacht during ww1 and had a long successful career writing literature throughout the 20th century    yes very comfy reading in his main works he was trying to outline a way to live in the modern world in a way that is both stirnerian/nietzschean and traditionallyminded ride the tiger is far and away his most interesting book but id put path of cinnabar revolt against the modern world and men among the ruins as prereqs for it
  start with at the mountains of madness
  unironically pretty good image agree with almost everything on here
  what are you talking about
nah its all meaningless bullshit   people only give a shit about evola because all the alt right kiddies need to have some kind of intellectual justification for reactionary fascist ideology
  you forgot to add no homo
  except nobody has read anything on the alt right
  not really no one really reads him especially the people whove read him
  youre right but theyll pretend they have read him to appear like their reactionary meme politics have some kind of intellectual tradition behind them
    by the way you write everyone can tell youve never read a single right wing author
  evolas message is mostly antisociety elitism  altright is just a mix of 1789/1932 populism and frogs  pick one
  you forgot to mention conspiracy theories but otherwise you got all the important buzzwords
  you seem to think /pol/tier reactionary politics are rational and intellectually consistent with the figures they latch onto youre wrong      ive read some  its usually all just endless drivel
  the fascists and the reactionaries did not even get along in the 20s/30s/40s like lol what are you talking about lol read a fucking book you mong
  trigger le nazis epic style
  ive read some  yes i bet you did that with your girlfriend that goes to another school
  post about evola on pol and you will get tons of people making fun of you calling him a schizo or a sperg  pol is cryptonazbol not traditionalist at all
  reactionary right wing politics isnt intellectually consistent     if evola contradicts national socialism ideology it doesnt fucking matter to the /pol/ type that is just desperately looking for intellectual justification      you and i both know that isnt true  any /pol/ book thread will always have recommendation for evola
  no politics are consistent specially when you blur the line between theory and propaganda which everybody does
  thats what im saying evola is just this mystical figure for altright /pol/ types to have some intellectual behind their ideas even if they dont match up entirely    reactionary politics doesnt have an intelelctual tradition so they latch on to the very few authors there are to say look my ideas are justified see theyre old just like liberalism or marxism or whatever
  reactionary right wing politics isnt intellectually consistent   reading you is like reading people who write about a cure for cancer its so apparent that you dont know anything about what youre talking
  yes it is you are making conclusions based on a priori synthetic assumptions concerning things you think you wouldnt like  theres no way a faggot like you would actually take the time to read one of evolas books you already know what your opinion about it should be based on a oneparagraph description of it
  you really think a bunch of horny and lonely 17 year olds on /pol/ give a shit if evola wasnt really a fascist they just want something to cling on to that validates their ideas          oh look a /pol/ book thread  oh look people recommending evola
  i dont think anybody in reactionary politics is deluded enough to think theres a decent unbroken tradition of reactionary politics thats why everybody is looking into old authors and some meme blogs that hit it big    the thing is that liberalism and marxism are a joke at this point so people are looking for alternatives of course the alternatives will look like a joke for a while when people are figuring things out and everything may turn out to be just another joke theres no reason to be optimistic about any of this
  oh look a /pol/ book thread  oh look people recommending evola  11 replies on the fastest board on this site that thread is just a few guys that got lost
  one post  consensus  also implying this has anything to do with evolas actual work  radfems like nietzsche does that mean i shouldnt read him youre just full of shit guy
  moving the goal post      i dont give a shit what you read evola is just reactionary trash people only give him the light of day because theyre looking for intellectual justification for their own reactionary meme ideology    im just repeating myself over and over   how are you dullards not understanding this
  i understand what you are saying but your point is smallbrained racists like papa johns so im not eating at papa johns tier garbage  i dont give a shit what you read  missing the whole point you are a total mong
  you dont have to avoid papa johns because racists like papa johns but papa johns is still poor quality garbage food that will probably make you sick

what does /lit/ think of this book
  inb4 its misery porn
  you forget by a fag hag  if youre going to quote me get it right
have any /lit/izens written on stimulants what was your experience    be way past original deadline for ma thesis  still havent written shit  sick of subject matter  sick of school  no motivation to write whatsoever despite having done tons of research and paying tons of money for every extra semester i take to get it done  get vyvanse scrip  woah check it out i can focus again instead of glazing over as soon as i start thinking about the behemoth project that looms ahead  woah i can write   write pages and pages and pages   continue on this track for weeks  go back and re read progress  syntax clunky superabundance of hypertechnical words phrases repeated over and over like an autist  not even really on topic  considerably less readable than my undergrad papers     tell me about your stim experiences bros
honest to god drugs are a nuissance and a great danger to the human person please dont use them     there are no shortcuts all that eases births a heaviness in proportion elsewhere
    they help me write very welland now im dependent on them  i chose to pursue the benefits at all costs
im not even entirely convinced that it is even possible to write without amphetamines
  see that first even entirely thats what i do in amps too clutter ever twice in one sentence it looks fine at first but over the course of a longer work you end up sounding like a bot
kerouac had a professional editor for on the road which was drafted on amphetamines it sounds like you arent interested in editing
  smoked meth one time  got a big blister on my finger from touching the pipe while it was roasting hot  spent the next ten hours writing on my phone  fingers were sweaty as fuck kept pressing the wrong buttons and shit by accident  wrote some weird archetypal shit about initiates and the way man bends and surrenders his creation into the everflowing light but leaves a little bit of it on earth for other men to take up and develop or something like that   also wrote about a primary school teaacher who rants about whatever in his classes sleeps in his office and uses them to work through his feels  cant remember exactly because someone wiped that phone at a party for shits and gigs but i definitely did get a fair bit of writing done and didnt stop for fucking hours  went back and changed shit over and again instead of just flowing as youd expect  on the whole it was a shit experience wouldnt recommend it at all     ive been having a strong coffee when i wake up before i start writing and it germinates a similar singlemindedness without all that disgusting confused energy
  have any /lit/izens written on stimulants  i tried but ya know those pills are really tiny i could only write a couple of words on each one
  ah well ive also been awake for a couple days too tweaked to sound good but tweaked enough to copy edit and format bullshit microsoft word     while i see your point does im not even entirely convinced it is possible sound alright its emphasis the second even is a typo and thats what editing is for for fiction i wait for the crash to write the emotional meat and get amped for filler scenery clarification etc it has its drawbacks but i think my writing has improved more as a speed freak than when i was a weepy drunk of course everyone has their poison     sometimes it helps to get a little botty once i scribbled out a bunch of facts and figures for a story about space travel that i wont dare try to edit sober
i can only write one page per day
stimulants  nofap  success  stimulants when fleshpilled  garbage
modafinil helps me reading and writing for longer periods of time  clonazepam helps me stop being so neurotic so i can actually write instead of stressing about it  i have not tried the combo yet because i have a heart problem will do and report in 6 months
  i think the old school macho version of this would be adderal/cocaine and alcohol
  how much longer have you taken op    i am in my first extra semester and in addition to the next one i am contemplating extending by another semester or two because i dont really give a fuck at this point but i am really scared about the lack of motivation to write hope it doesnt get worse    as to the stimulants ive been abusing them since first year undergrad and they are absolutely disgusting i need to stop medicating i just abuse them and masturbate furiously and i am even starting to hate coffee if it exceeds more than one cup
  right now i dont have time to do any writing because i tried to do a year at uni without amphetamines and completely bombed so now im doing it again but drugged this time so the powers that be are watching extra closely in case i fuck up again    however i have written in the past and its really the only way i get anything done it doesnt make my prose better or worse nor my ideas it just lets me avoid distraction and listlessness    behold the ultra pseud he has no idea what it is to have a mental condition but hes damn well sure that drugs are bad stay on the straightedge path anon even if it destroys your life    retard nigger kike shit
  and i am even starting to hate coffee if it exceeds more than one cup  this 100 happened to me though i love the taste of coffee but i cant drink it it reminds me of my meds too much  that said im doing this thing where i take meds two or three days a week and drink coffee for the other days those two or three days of solid work are enough to let me slack off and only do a couple of hours work on the others    my gf would sympathise on the masturbation thing lmao
  basedpilled
ive been on stimulants since i was 6 and have done most of my writing on them  not as good as cardiovascular and calesthenic exercises unbelievably effective in combination with exercise and a good diet
its not a true blue stimulant like an amp but the handful of times ive tried to write on lsd i just get distracted and wanna read or watch something instead because im overwhelmed and my brain has so much going on even on low doses microdosing is a different experience though i feel like a superhuman on 1015ug
  coke makes me really focussed but i barely use it because obvious reasons weed is useless gets me distracted and extremely narcissistic so i tend to believe the most stupid ideas are awesome and regret later mushrooms and dmt gets me too euphoric but they get me the best ideas to develop later also mushrooms at least in my case work as antidepressants so i like them alcohol a glass of wine or bourbon can get me comfy enough if i am already in the mood aside cocaine there is no stimulant that magically gives me the will or grace to write
  drink my way to around 06 and chase with somewhere between 300500mg of caffeine end up writing long rambling sentences using complex and rather uncommon words i enjoy it but i hate hearing it looks great but i dont understand what you are trying to say from normals it would be pretentious if it wasnt genuine and i had to refer to a thesaurus its just verbose i wish i could speak half as elegantly as i write in this state but growing up around ebonics and the people that utilized this language has limited me greatly    if i could find a way to shed out of this limitation without the use of drugs i would be more than happy to do so
books that prove metaphysics isnt as important as scientific physics
books that prove that science and technology are memes
  mein kampf    the bible
   no that metaphysics is imaginary bullshit a friend of mine keeps saying its important so whats a book that will prove him wrong and show that science and technology are actually important and not this fairy shit
  there are not any your friend is right
  how to tie a noose for dummies
    cringe
  yet redpilled imo
  maybe metaphysics isnt necessarily unscientific  on questions like these i usually try to rely upon the practitioner vs analyzer analogy but what do i know i am a brainlet
  so whats a book that will prove him wrong and show that science and technology are actually important and not this fairy shit  anything by any logical positivist try rudolf carnaps the destruction of metaphysics through the logical analysis of language or some shit or just print the last page of the tractatus by wittgenstein and show him prop 653   youre a brainlet though and i really disagree with what you want to prove faggot
  scientific physics  you mean empiricism you cant prove it kant never did
  so kant wasnt the smartest man to ever live
  youre wrong most physicists inclined towards the foundations of their discipline deal heavily in metaphysics if you think theres actually a significant animosity between the two youre wrong
  smarter than you
  prove  importance  its easy to see you dont know shit about what you are talking
dumb weeaboo
  namefag
stop living in the early 20th century the era of metaphysics has been back for a while after the failure of the positivist project aristotle towers above your pathetic instrumental reason
  that article by carnap is so fucking stupid were people really impressed by this at the time theres nothing more disappointing than reading early analytic philosophy i guess it was just the pervasive optimism of the time thats so anachronistic today
metaphysics is science dough
  unironically descartes meditations science will get you immortality and freedom from pain metaphysics will get you fuckall
  yes he was
  the joke  hownewru
  bait
nigger you cant even have language without metaphysics
  dude i fucking love science  whats the point of asking for recs when youre evidently too retarded to read
  your scientism is abhorrent as even science deals in metaphysics in order to even practice physics if anything youre most likely conflating mysticism with metaphysics    read about alfred north whiteheads process metaphysics and the scientists that made use of it in their work
  there is metaphysics within physics
  fucking hell just read the first two chapters of aristotles metaphysics he literally says that metaphysics is the most unproductive and impractical science ever concieved

the combination of encouraging users to strive for an arbitrary goal and encouraging them to leave a simple star review which literally nobody uses correctly means that the rating system is completely and utterly useless     the site is not too bad outside of that but read the actual reviews instead of the numbers if you want to gauge the reception of a book

  ya heavily marketed anyone can read and understand it and its popular in general nowadays its not that strange that a large percentage of the largest group of readers does read it the only strange thing is that publishers have not rebranded it yet as young adult does sound a little immature
  sounding immature isnt really a big deal in recent times video games and comic books dont even have to try to look mature and adults love them
  i disagree both comics and vidya have tried to change their image moving away from being media exclusively consumed by kids

  it should be rebranded to quick reads or casual reads because a lot of ya gets consumed on peoples vacations no harm done i literally finished the deathly hallows beside a swimming pool      yeah but in fairness a colourful looking video game or comic has a similar appeal to the pixar movies or anime people just like things that are nice to look at but the benefit of a video game is that the player is an active participant and can engage with different gameplay mechanics id suggest that captain toad treasure tracker video game its very colourful inoffensive and initially might feel childish but its stuffed with intricate details and accessible puzzles that its understandable why its gained the following that it has

what the fuck was his problem
  a spoiled kid that still didnt get appreciation from his brothers resulting in a downward spiral of ratting them out to at least know that the parents still got his back while antagonizing the people he wants to get close to
  he thought he was better than all of them
  he was a marxist
ah fookinait fachists
his political writings are his worst writings
    aww look at buttblasted nazilarpers somebody offended hitlersenpai
  1984 was equally and probably more so a commentary on stalinist fascism
    honestly hes the only socialist i really like if there were more like him and if i was a materialist i might be converted
  ah fookinait tolstoy
  stalinist fascism  makes about as much sense as nationalist socialism
  i meant it as a synonym of totalitarianism
me being a bitchboi who cant shoot an elephant illustrates the failures of colonialism  also i fought for the losers in the spanish civil war
  disagree but thats because i know more than you about the world
is there a single person on earth that doesnt get butthurt by something orwell said
  yes stalin indeed was a national socialist
  this but unironically also im yorkshire so i unironically speak like that too
oi laddie you calling me a fachist fer reporting me comrades to her majesties intelliguns aijensy shut your focking mouth or ill give you a propa batting
what jobs do you philosophy majors have or plan on getting im really contemplating law school but im afraid im too lazy to be good at it
i unironically serve coffee to some corporate stooge im a fucking gofer
  did you ever think about law school
is there anyone completely repulsed by employment but found something they enjoyed regardless i just cant think of anything that i want to be doing everyday but i have to do something
none i changed to stem after realizing this
  bureaucratic administration needs policy people who know how to think good
  im a brainlet besides the academia where do philosophy majors work
  home depot
  my mistake i wanted to know where they want to work not where they actually work
  professor
  is there a place besides education/academy where they can work
whatever you do just stop considering law school right now its a terrible draining profession unless youre a sociopath
diplomat
  unironically the only reason anyone puts up with employment is to feed a wife and kids just dont get married and dont have children a single man can enjoy life on surprisingly little the biggest problem is the eventual estrangement of your married friends try to redpill some of them before its too late
  that was me a decade ago graduated from ucb now im in the gig economy i asked myself just yesterday could i ever recapture that firey ambition and i cant corporate lawyers disgust me 15 hour days befuddle me money status etc seems so remote like a far off island i visited once and remains shrouded in a fog     maybe im mentally ill parasitic cowardly delusional sad sac loser lacking the will to get his shit together or even see the point of trying or maybe im just content with getting my needs met hanging out with my girlfriend reading books thinking meditating     whad you guys think confused or clear eyed
  sure but even without kids you still have to work
  i honestly feel like i dont belong in any career and no form of employment could ever make me happy
  lemme guess your mother was ice and your father was angry all the time
  careful of social pressures what youre desiring is fair
stay at home daddy
  you can work in public relations or the media if you have no conscience or shame
im a philosophy major and fuck law school im going to do philosophy with my philosophy degree
im an easily manipulated nonentity and got into business due to my parents influence i dont think its an interesting subject at all and my prospects for work are either corporate which i would probably hate or taking over my fathers business which my father himself in a moment of honesty admitted is utterly joyless  i kind of want to drop out and study philosophy but i hate almost everything associated with it besides the philosophical works themselves and specially i hate my countrys academia   i dont seem to have any shot at living even a minimally satisfying life i wonder if i should kill myself
  just get a minimum wage job and live an ascetic life in a tiny apartment spending all your free time reading and working out
  i love my mom and never knew my father growing up
  better getting a mediocre office job when you can hopefully just slack off a read minimum wage work fucking sucks
  why do you ask this
  this is what im doing i havent done the slack off and read at desk stuff yet want to wait like a year or so till i do that
  sounds like buddenbrooks
  dont go to law school its unironically a bad decision at all levels i did really well on the lsat got a bunch of offers to elite law schools and turned them all down to be a teacher    the actual practice of law sucks its insanely time intensive the debt is insane the stress is insane lawyers suffer from depression and alcoholism at considerably higher levels than the general population thats not even taking into account the opportunity cost of three years of missed work the saturated market and dismal wages for about 80 of practicing lawyers just dont do it if you have the brains for it go into computer science if you want a more lit job become a teacher or an editor or something
janitor or something
  if you have the brains for it go into computer science  is it worth it to go back to school for a second bachelors worried that ill be too old by the time i finish that degree up
  what does it matter when philosophy is your one chance to glimpse the divine
  because as im sure you well know the divine has defaulted on the bill payments and keeps taking up fridge space with his aunts leftovers
  computer science  brains  not saturated    t pajeet
i work at a surf shop
    go to school to be educated not trained like a monkey to preform double major in stem and liberal arts if you cant do this either out of personal inability or some ridiculous rule dont go to university there is no need for more mindless drones slaving away at their programming job the fact that youre here shows you can probably do at least a minor in a liberal art as well but there were so many at university that couldnt hold any discussion on anything outside of their chosen field be more
  preform
  you got me no one ever makes spelling mistakes
  im currently a phil major at ucb reading this was very encouraging anon
  but what does that matter if the aunt was metaphysical in essence only then could the leftovers mean anything at all what is fridge space anyway i can just keep nibbling on others food as the quid pro quo of being a philosophy grad mutatis mutandis i will be fed and well thine stomach knows only the limits of thine heart      also i pick up money off the ground outside walmart
  i do this listen to audiobooks or just find a private place and whip out my kindle
  it was dear old diogenes who said after all if only one could satisfy the stomach as masturbating or something to that effect sure the aunt may very well be a spectre a haunt in the hollow as it were but the leftovers are of clear substance made evident by the disgusting excuse for a human who actually eats them
  you got more advice on either im interested in working in editing but not sure where to start also not sure if teaching is as great as it sounds
  based
im about to go into a programming degree starting in january please convince me to pursue philosophy instead used to study english through my sophomore year of college before taking a year off
  double major and you will be a king trust me youll have the practical skills of a cs major but the worldview of a philosophy major
  depends on what your ambition is rooted in mine was built on a houseofcards foundation emotional avoidance you compensate the emptiness with a glut of the dominant cultural currency once i got to know my emotions and found a girl with unwavering love secure attachment all my goals changed on their own     as long as youre already a secure honest with yourself person youll be fine anon if notits gonna get pretty dark
  thanks anon
  double major  desu unless you are really deadset on this i would choose between the two youll be spreading yourself too thin and if you wanted to get a cs job youll find that you dont know as much as you hoped to know and if you wanted to be a based phil major youll find that you really dont know all too much and all of your essays will be of lower possible quality because you were spending so much time doing cs homework there is a lot of intersection between the two fields though but i do not believe that it warrants a double major
  you could argue that what hed lose in ultimate job cash hed make back in the richness of phil
  thats a good point but from what i hear only really top cs students get jobs i could obviously be wrong though and he may just be super intelligent
  no idea where you heard this if you go to a decent school and you get mediocre grades youll find work its mostly about sideprojects anyway for a lot of applications major does not put you at a disadvantage you will not be spread too thin with a doublemajor if you choose to drop phil thats fine but major in something else such as stats wasting four years and coming out with nothing but a cs degree is a waste also no company looks down on double majors i would know i worked at a career center for 4 years  but dont take my word for it visit your unis center and do your own research
    also phil/cs is very common because of the intersection of ethics and tech especially ai and agi this is the only common humanities combo with cs however cs is usually paired with another stem usually stats knowing stats is very relevant in the industry atm or econ relevant if you want to work in corporate/finance cs
  children are a secular chance at immortality a piece of who you are lives on in them
  humans will be the one species that doesnt go extinct
  no idea where you heard this  i hear it here all the time tbqh all the stem people on sci say it
  fair and i cant refute that because i have just as much of a claim to legitimacy as them being an anon on a different board so what do you do well try visiting some job boards seeing what the requirements are how many jobs there are etc visit a government statistics website to see what the industry trends are visit your uni career center and talk to them see if you can network with professionals in cs in sum do your own fucking research   also  believing what sci says
        thanks for your input anons im enrolling in arizona states online program they supposedly have a top rated computer science program and again supposedly graduates from asu/their online program have a high hiring rate after graduation the online degree is like a year and a half of classes taken 7 weeks at a time with work every day my thought was that i could take philosophy classes at the local community college and get an associates degree but at the same time is an actual degree worth more than just reading in my spare time instead of fucking around on /lit/ would there be any benefit from an associates degree compared to just having the knowledge and doing a lot of reading and research older or experienced anons pls direct me because i have no idea what the fuck im doing
  as far as philosophy goes you can learn quite a bit doing self study you could even be better than most philosophy majors probably however nothing beats having to actually write about the topics you are interested in you are actually being forced to prove what you have learned from the text you are reading
  not sure how good community colleges are not from the us but from my research not particularly good the rigor of an academic institution for the undergraduate population reflects the institutions average student you cant place princeton standards on a local college as such youre best not wasting your money on the college    the situation would have been different if you were studying at some one institution where you could take both a major in cs and phil     i must remind you however that this is /lit/ and much better sources exist for you to make your decision than the musings of some anons that read halfway through the republic for their elective pol100 credit
  i rent a room to a friend from high school finishing his cs degree he is a senior the university he/we went to is id say second rate certainly in cs and anything stem though it has a big name in the state he was hired out of his summer internship by a major bank to code for them in another city nearby it wont be fun or fulfilling work but its certainly well paid if you major in cs youll probably have a lot of work options but it likely wont be work youll enjoy
  thats a fair point i definitely wouldnt retain or probably comprehend as much on my own if i didnt have to write papers on them
  thats a good point its definitely a different situation than in person university top kek at your last comment thats also very true ill do some more research thanks anon      thats my biggest problem i think ill be good at cs and have decent job security but im pretty concerned i wont be happy when i was younger i reeeally wanted to be rich but now that im almost 21 im realizing after pretty much a whole lifetime of treatment resistant depression id rather be happy and money isnt what im after sorry for the diary entry i guess part of happiness is security and if im decent at cs or even at a shit company making more than average us yearly salary i can work towards being happier    i really appreciate everyone whos offered their input and advice i dont have anyone irl who can give me some insight and help me think through shit
  its never too late is what most people say but then even if youre 22 old enough to have graduated it seems as though the world has left you behind   consider a parttime/open university degree so at least you can make progress in other areas and avoid the stagnation of being a student
  the myth of the saturated computer science workforce is only true of silicon valley people assume that because they cant break into the key industry of one of the richest areas in the world it is like that everywhere but there is a surplus of work for computer scientists elsewhere   there is also huge potential growth in nonestablished computer markets
  a joint degree is a nice idea but i dont see how it avoids one becoming a drone most humanities departments seem completely unable to fill the philosophical void in our culture than everyone has become aware of in the past few years either you are taught the outdated 20th century boomer syllabus or instead a crash course in social justice and the virtues of nato
join the air force
i have unironically heard that phil majors are highly desired in high finance as qualitative analysts 
i work a data entry job i think a lot of people on 4chan from my experience are datacuck s
  on that image why isnt mathematics the most mathematical topic
  how is history of science that intelligent isnt history of science mostly pure ideology retroactively created that makes no sense if you check the actual history
  ywn never attend a creative wriging college class  why live brehs
  thanks anon i really needed that
  honestly just get a degree from a presitgious institution regardless of what it is and youre set you should be more worried where youre majoring rather than what youre majoring in thats what employers care about most with the only exceptions being vocational degrees directly related to a job you wont get without one like medicine
  high quality response
  monkeys certainly make mistakes
  imagine having that talent at 22 anyone who says its not genetic is lying or stupid
  single mother upbringing you never find a case where ennui prevails but the upbringing was sound excluding genes associated with sociopathy odd borderline etc
seeing some people in this thread saying they want a job just to do something even if they hate the idea of having a job thought id share what i do for a living and how i see it    im a mailman i deliver mail by bike and when i finish my route i go home if theres a lot of mail we work later from 817 maybe if theres very little mail we work from 81330 or sometimes even less than that its a job where you take one day at a time and you are providing a small but meaningful service to the community  you spend the morning sorting the mail that youre supposed to deliver into slots then you pack that mail into the bike and head out its simple fairly thoughtless but at least its not pointless its simple but its also not too easy theres barely time for lunch the office supplies are the cheapest the company can afford some of my coworkers are retards literally i think one of my coworkers is disabled i saw her drool once and the pay isnt really that good  on the other hand old ladies always stop and talk for a couple of minutes people always hold the door for the mailman and shoot a smile my way kids look amazed when i fly by on my bike and dogs always give me a hard time  the point is that at least i know that even though my job is simple and hard work its needed its a job where i can spend the days daydreaming about whatever i want and still go home with sore legs a good mood and with a feeling like ive done something    i dont make a whole lot of money and my coworkers are mostly retards but at least the work doesnt take my backbone or my soul from me like so many high status jobs seem to do for so many men im not saying dont get educated and im not saying dont pursue your career if you want to im just saying there is joy to be found in simple work even if you might think life is just bills and endless expectations
be a man and pick up a trade  good hours good money practical skills and you wont be a limpwristed fag anymore
i got my ma in philosophy and english literature joint a few years back after a few miserable years working as a support worker with adults with autism i am now a selfemployed dog walker    its not the most lucrative business in the world but it pays more than i expected and it makes me genuinely happy
i wanted to be a filmmaker but im far too lazy alternatively id like to neet it for the rest of my life or become a monk but one of those indolent monks who reads all day     i find myself stuck in an academic coach job teaching english in a school to a bunch of underachievers when only ten or so smart and motivated kids turn up to the sessions its actually quite an enjoyable job that doesnt happen anymore though i just had a group of twenty five 14 year olds barely any of whom were listening and those that were listening could rarely hear me and when they could they didnt understand what i was saying quite a few of them were mocking me under their breath to their friends    im not cut out for this job im lazy im a bad explainer i cant improvise i have a weak voice that i cant project im not intimidating or charismatic enough to gain their respect ive only been here two months and im beyond fed up ive been working in education for three years and i dont know why i dont know what else i can do or who would take me i just want a little job to save little money  a job with not a lot of responsibility and hours preferably     thanks for skimming over my blogpost im going to neck myself now

  do you have any advice for a law student to practice his social skills have you always been a confident and social person how old are you    no need to read what is past here  i started philosophy at the top university on my country but i drop it because i saw what my future was a sad mysantrope meek teacher so i joined law school to impact the world in more meaningfull ways and to improve my social skills a retarded excuse i just wanted to change something in mynlife as it could change myself  i dont read or write but inconsider myself a voracious reader and a good writer just because iam delusional  when i changed majors i actually had the fantasy of becoming like you and i still have that hope but my lazyness and lack of social skills are a monumental obstacle to achieve that ideal  i get the part of spoking your soul with sincerity y also think thats the trait of any good piece of art and i see why i am a failure of a person i lie constantly i am ashamed of myself so i always make things up even the more trivial things i would like to be like you i dont know you but i am really glad you have a meaningfull job and a good life sorry for this horrible post
  nice larp
  what kinda books you like
  same the audiobooks and mindfulness is great dont mind the judgment as time goes on but i do wish i had a bit more job securityworrying about the next recession
  gotta be the latter too bad you cant beat the little fuckers with a switch like the goo ol days
  really real  care to offer any tangential evidence that any of this is true
    care to offer any tangential evidence that any of this is true    no i really dont but i am curious on simply a theoretical level what would you take to be evidence if i substantiated one part of my claim would the other parts become credible to you does it matter which part
  yeah im really starting to realize how fucked up i am as a result of my childhood

  your affected speech is the tell youve spent time memorizing words from books you should be reading and never polished them off in conversation to know how to sound like an actual human being     not that i care if you want to play pretend on the internet catfish away m8
  currently looking at a customer service advisor role however once i graduate i might come back to law school and become a barrister not a barista
    thats not even close to answering my question you moron i couldnt care less about actually convincing you or counteracting your mocksherlockholmespokertabletell bullshit simply youre wrong what i care about is what it would in theory take to convince you     obviously you dont believe me i dont care why you dont i only care about what it would take in your mind to get you to believe me
  take a picture of that library
  hmm and what would you have to see in that image for it to count as proof

im sick of not being able to get a job applications dont go anywhere people think im trying to scam them because im intelligent and sociable there must be a catch this guy is leaving something out he must be a corporate spy
      hey man im a mid20s white dude who is wellread charismatic articulate eloquent etc and i live in dc would you consider having a fellow /lit/ poster as a full or parttime paid intern
ended up going to trade school after paid off my loans real quick after apprenticeship and make my own hours/way more money and still have time to read or write whenever i want
  if youre just looking to make money it makes more sense to go to pharmacy school than trade school if you already have your bachelors degree trade school apprenticeship and landing a good gig takes about 3 years total
    do you actually live in dc etc or are you just mocking me
what kind of career should i pursue if tons of people tell me im good at explaining difficult concepts to others in an easily understandable way im working on it right now which is probably where i honed this skill because end users are often retards but i would shoot myself if i had to do it for the rest of my life i enjoy helping people but the corporate nature of the job and indifference of companies to your existence really kills it for me
  priesthood
  i do i take the redline metro every day and i went to high school in montgomery country im away from dc for around two weeks atm but i would definitely be interested in interning if you guys did that after i get back around the 15th16th we could meet and get coffee etc if you wanted to learn more about me in the meantime im free to chat and email etc despite not being in dc    you can reach me at cervantes18314gmailcom
  ive unironically thought about it but i have so many of my own sins that i couldnt even imagine being someones confessor i do such a bad job caring for even the one soul god has entrusted me with  how could i possibly provide adequate care for others as well to be a bad layman sends one man to hell but a bad priest could endanger countless others
  seeing that little green frog wiggle made me happy
  as long as you arent using your position to commit sin i dont see it being bad in fact it might even be better because you know the cost first hand
  how do i become a priest
  if youre orthodox like me you talk to your priest then get approval from your bishop to go to seminary where you eventually go get ordained as a deacon then eventually a parish priest from there the bishop assigns you to a parish if you want to be married you gotta do it before youre ordained
  if youre catholic talk to a priest about a vocation and hell direct you to the proper diocese  alternatively you could become a nondiocesan priest by becoming a first a monk and expressing the vocation and alternatively still you could become a member of opus dei and be invited to the priesthood there which if im not mistaken still practice their usual careers but with the collar on    if i believed in god i would do it i cant say i do though considering this it would just feel disingenuous and fake i think most prelates enter for social acclaim or familial pressure which i feel is wrong too honestly the only reason to join in my opinion is if you have ambitions for the papacy slim chance but id say its more realistic of a goal than say becoming president
maybe its dickish to point this out but the entire christian belief system is based on eyewitness testimony and books written 50 years after the fact why would anyone side with eyewitness testimony in which there are numerous instances of falseness and fraudulence over the laws of physics in which there are no instances of even a single violation
then again even if theres no god lord knows the dollars no profit so pop that collar anon
  the whole programming is mindless drone work meme is kinda baseless sure there is a lot of debugging and and updating but a lot of the work is really engaging and requires considerable creativity you can get lucky and work with a small team of really smart well read people but whatever makes dismissing technology as a career bearable
  i mean dont expect any sort of work to make you happy be thankful if you have a job that you can tolerate there is a reason youre being paid to do it
  the world needs far fewer people like you
undergrad honors in phil and poli sci  masters in poli sci    currently working in content marketing and affiliate marketing making about 3035k about 14 months out of grad school next year i plan on branching into solo work ranking a website i build linking to affiliate car insurance sites and selling it after a year for 300400k the guy i write content for just sold one of his for a million
  i should mention thats 30k from home having to deal with literally no one and maybe 30 hours of labor a week
  does the work stimulate you touch that creative or sensitive side
    priest
  sensitive no creative somewhat i write about things every day usually thousands of words of course its too entice people to purchase a service or product but i mean i dont mind doing this when im 23 24 25 in my later 20s ill probably settle into a career apart from marketing but i grew up poor and fuck staying poor i crave security more than anything im still productive creatively to an extent so this life will suffice     marketing is far more creatively satisfying than academia ever was btw

how is my choice of translations some of them ive read some i havent  quixote  grossman  anna karenina  bartlett  wp  maude  notes from underground  pv  crime and punishment  ready  the idiot  mcduff  demons  maguire  tbk  avsey  metamorphosis  neugroschel  trial  breon mitchell  borges collected fictions  hurley  odyssey  fitzgerald  the stranger  ward  oblomov  pearl  fathers and sons  carson  faust  luke  divine comedy  ciardi  we  randall  madame bovary  thorpe  berlin alexanderplatz  hofmann  dead souls  guerney  platos dialogues  grube  symposium  gill  book of disquiet  jull costa  chekhovs stories  wilks  steppenwolf  horrock  swanns way  davis
  you forgot one  op  faggot
  a few weird choices overall but definitely dont go for the pv notes from underground people complain about garnett but shes the only one who properly captures the narrators voice in english here obviously she has her issues with accuracy so get the version revised by ralph matlaw and its phenomenal
perfectly fine    i really liked pearls goncharov translations i hope he does the precipice one day too
if you have any intention at all of reading the whole of in search of lost time you should go with moncrieff
  can you post a pic of the first page and the isbn of the edition you have
and now go read them all you faggot
what is /lits opinion on bret easton ellis
only he and nabokov have given me an erection
  lazy rich slob with a messy night stand effiminate feet
if david foster wallace is the walmart of pseudointellectual writers bee is the target
faggot hack who would be less notable than franzen so less than zero if a talented director hadnt used his completely mediocre monogimmick look at me im doing social commentary book as inspiration for a film having almost nothing to do with the source material a fact ellis himself pretentiously highlighted in the interview with charlie rose     a total fucking nothing just an accidental afterthought byproduct of america assuming a priori that it needs a literary scene in the 90s rather than having one arise organically from genuinely talented people that initial platform made him famous for being a writer so when journo faggots who write about writers want to write about something or buy something or review something they go i guess i should read like franzen or bret easton ellis or something and the meme perpetuates itself for one more day     no one will read bret easton ellis in fifteen years let alone fifty let alone a hundred
  t franzen
  i lold out loud at a few parts in american psycho and got boners from a few other scenes   it was too long though  less than zero was good edgelord depravity   lunar park had some funny scenes as well with bret getting married to a woman and moving to the suburbs
  take your meds jon
platonic form of gayface he should have that foot examined by a doctor immediately
  70 of lunar park is laugh out lmao the rest is so bad it evens the book out to blah
  why are boomer s allowe d to be barefoot
  good writer with a terrible podcast and a comically bad taste in movies less than zero and the informers are better than american psycho
  you will go to jail for getting a boner reading nabakov
  i like him 2bh
  which movies he likes
  i liked the movie american psycho
  but i was reading pale fire when it happened
  not being rock hard for the entire time you read ada
american psycho is great i liked less than zero and thought the informers was okay i think i will read glamorama and lunar park one day the rest of his books dont interest me
  hes a stupid untalented cunt
  whats with the horrible photo
american psycho is by far the only good work of his one almost thinks it some kind of fluke
  hes a contrarian if its acclaimed he hates it if its garbage he loves it batman vs super man was his 1 film of 2016 if i recall
why does /lit/ hate grrm
  envy
because he seems to have time for every shit under the sun except finishing his asoiaf series i have been a fan since 2005 but fuck him seriously it has been more than seven years since dance with dragons was published
it will never be finished
i hope he does before he finishes the series they are shit anyway just a bunch of copypaste historical cultures and events with a fantasy coating im not surprised if he just mixed the accursed kings with lord of the rings
i was a fan of his from back in 2002 and as soon as he got the hbo show he stopped giving a fuck about asoiaf and was all about the wild cards and the jean cocteau cinema and going on talkshows completely stopped caring about writing     hes a money grubbing scam artist fuck him
  dude is fucking with his readers you see every year he releases stupid shit and it feels like he wont finish his mainline series
  hes popular and successful and achieved selfactualization as an author
i love grrm  dude   sex and dragons  duuuuude  sex n fuckin dragons  read all the books of asofai and watched the hbo series wow very good this and rick mortry are the bestest things in the whole wide wolrd  
hes a mediocre fiction writer who gets more praise than he deserves
t  a  x    p  o  l  i  c  y
so basically people hate him because hes miura
  why does literature board hates guy who stopped writing his story since he earns money out of doing nothing but accepting bullshit tv makers do damn dude thats like mystery of the century
he said mean things about president trump i must create a safe space for president trump so he can make america great again
  reeeeeee stop enjoying stuff
  the brainlet response who thinks everything is a matter of individual taste rather than there being something wrong with them
  hes not very good and normies wont shut up about him  but hes also not /lit/erature this isnt a board for genre fiction outside the occasional thread like this
  it speaks volumes when people parrot this shit even if you agree with in in principle for it to be a pavlovian response means you constantly get shit on for your taste same for people who cry about elitists and contrarians
  hes stuck up his own ass not even a trace of humility
  reeeeeee stop criticizing stuff
  ive never read any of his books and have no reason to hate him i dislike his fans who incessantly push his books and the television spin off in an attempt to make themselves seem big brained
sunset found her
he doesnt understand how society in the middle ages worked
  nothing personal as a golden rule i dislike everything that is both pretentious and degenerate
fat people disgust me because it requires a certain personality to get like that and that personality manifests itself throughout his books hes a slow writer because hes lazy and his writings are filled with descriptions of food and meals when it isnt otherwise preoccupied with the authors sexual dysfunctions
  he thinks asoiaf is pretentious    have you ever tried real literature
  not him and pretentious isnt the word id use for asoiaf but something is pretentious when it acts like it has more meaning and depth than it actually does  presumably if something is real literature it actually has the depth so its not contradictory to find grrm pretentious and to enjoy real literature
    george rr martin is the only one who understands who middles ages work if you read actually history it really bloody     tolkien didnt understand how middle ages work     tolkien had a childish understanding of history that was blinded by catholic faith george rr martin actually understand european history and is not blinded by religion
  george rr martin is the only one who understands who middles ages work  george rr martin actually understand european history  if youre not meming please pick up an actual history book for adults theres a lot more to the middle ages than there was a lot of rape and murder
  shut up retard
  asoiaf isnt pretending to be anything other than an entertaining fantasy series what exactly is pretentious about it
    andal invasion  saxon invasion  aegon the conqueror  william the conqueror  current events  war of roses     contrast that with lord of the rings which is based on a fairy tale medieval history
  history is just events that happened  thats like a 12 year olds understanding of history read a proper book
    shit writer
  hack who cant even finish his own series
  im not that anon but lotr is intentionally based on old english folk myths its not supposed to mirror the real middle ages
  and now explain all of the incest and irreligiousness
  i enjoy his books for what they are theyre extremely entertaining and its probably my favorite fantasy series ive ever read theyre well constructed and i like how differently the povs are written  i dislike grrm because hes a lazy fuck who got even lazier once he got his hbo tv series he wont stop wasting time on stupid shit and i honestly believe hes going to die before finishing asoiaf i hate the tv show because of changed characters and the fanbase it brought in
  when people talk about historical accuracy in a novel they mean the way people lived and interacted with each other and how closely this coincided with historical reality not whether any story elements are inspired by real life events a novel inspired by the battle of bulge that uses laser pistols would not be considered historically accurate     one way that asoiaf is not historically accurate is the way sex and war are portrayed as far as sex goes theres a wildly disproportionate amount of rape and other sexual degenerates compared to normal sex between married couples when it comes to war theres some very obnoxious anachronisms martin applies a modern conception of total war where civilians are legitimate targets to a medieval world where targeting peasants make no sense generally speaking medieval wars were private affairs between nobles and monarchs and peasants were left alone not only because they werent taking part of the fighting but because they were also tied to the property that was being fought over if youre trying to take over a castle to hold and keep as your own it wouldnt make much sense to burn it to the ground because then you would have nothing to win the same logic applies to peasants    i could go on but another severe example that really annoys me is this myth that nobles had the right to rape women on their marriage night or whatever martin portrays this throughout the books and it has no historical basis whatsoever although he genuinely thinks it does and has said as much
  youre just parroting basic enlightenment doctrine now which narrows anything different or other down to something grimdark
  i doubt tolkien was trying to realistically portray the middle ages he wanted to write an epic rooted on european folklore and literature and in that regard it succeeded  or do you claim that homer didnt know about how the ancient world really was because of how he portrayed it in the odyssey and the iliad
  shut up nerd
  this its ridiculous to claim that grrm has a good understanding of medieval england based on his books   its not about events its about their culture and values asoiaf feels like what your average modern american whos listened to a medieval history podcast thinks life was like back then
    droit du seigneur has a ton of historical evidence that it happened it even written into law that you cannot do this     most of the weapons written in the book are historically accurate     peasants died a lot during war of the roses not sure what historically inaccurate with that    rape in medieval times was really high just was not talked about since you know women not having that much power
  contrarianism
  droit du seigneur has a ton of historical evidence that it happened it even written into law that you cannot do this  where
  because he is a rapist
  martins characters have mono dimensional and random behavioral patterns their actions are not prepared in the script they delve into erratic petty politics and schemes to provoke and impress the reader in a world that dragons existed and exist and in a world that shadows kill people from afar and magical frost themed outsiders threaten the lands how can that make sense why would you care about taxes and who your psychopath son will marry in his reign when there are priests who raise the dead and assassins who take whatever form they want in order to kill whomever they want etc this is an art that poses as pseudo realistic but in truth is an undecided mix of high fantasy medieval pseudo realism porn epic parody and martins personal complex about how cruel the world is the problem with his art is that it does not make sense and it does not have cohesion and a robust core like tolkiens art did he fails because he has not decided on what the core of his work is hell he doesnt even have a main story oh and by the way he needs to lose the rrs from his middle name its embarrassing
  2 things  a youre wrong  b shut the fuck up  imagine being this retarded  tolkien wasnt writing middle ages dipshit he wrote an allegory for his experiences in ww1 while creating a world for the language he invented to exist in because he was a linguist and flavored his world with his love of european folklore
im not much of an ol grrmy fan but all of 4chan is contrarians shitting on whats popular when the show ends and its ending is one that pisses off tons of people everyone will be here laughing and then move onto what everyone else loves at that moment
  wrong he hated allegory
  the first 3 books were fine the only thing that interested me in the fourth one was the introduction of aeron damphair
  pulls the most generic overused comparison off reddit that the man gave you himself   but george is the unoriginal one
  george rr martin is the only one who understands who middles ages work  lol nah man westeros is practically an atheist society religion has barely any function while in the real middle ages christianity controlled almost every facet of peoples lives     grrm is a typical boomer hippy with a negative view of religion and cant wrap his head around a society actually being religious so he makes the focus on violence and sex and food because thats all he cares about lmao
i quite honestly do not see or understand the appeal of fantasy i am suspicious of adults who enjoy fantasy
  whats the appeal of any fiction

pink  fat  mast
  the  more  she  shat
  i like your thinking
  whats your point because he filed the names off of real historical factions that he is good theres nothing inherently wrong with that to a point but it sounds like he passed that point long ago
  he needs to lose the rrs  a thousand times yes
  so he said didnt he also deny the norse inspirations for middle earth
be george rr martin  get your book series adapted for tv  gain legions of insufferable manchildren who worship you overnight   economically well off enough to do whatever you want artistically   decide to focus on what you want to write with the few years you have left  the insufferable manchildren you never asked for start throwing a hissyfit   condemned by said manchildren for not catering to them even though youve written dozens of works these idiots could go back and read instead of begging for a new book like youre their court jester who has to keep them entertained with stories of dragons and incest     i dont like got but i feel bad for the author he doesnt owe his ungrateful fans anything the fact that people have enough time to dedicate themselves to fandoms is just fucking sad enjoy the books or tv shows then fucking get on with your life
does this board have a point besides being a place for people to call each other manchildren
  implying got isnt the most manbabyish fandom
  yes but you made the mistake of coming to a thread for grrm in a board for actual literature and expecting actual discussion
  start something and dont finish it  why are you angry
  this board is for memes about not having a gf and for complaining about libcucks/commies
  i dont know them well enough to argue that the only fans i know keep it to themselves    id sooner call the fallout or star wars original trilogy fandoms that which isnt to say that either of them havent been screwed by their glorious leaders but they sure do bring everybody else down for liking what they dont

whats some core kino essential premium neat chinese lit

  journey to the west is the only chinese book you should read the rest is just fucking propaganda this includes the art of war
not core but should be the chuci weird ornate semishamanic poetry from ancient southern china

    dao de ting / tao te ching but its pure fucking mud so get something with a good in depth analysis because thats all youll get from it core philosophy text    art of war is a meme but read it anyway doesnt take long    journey to the west is fun hilarious and easy     romance of the three kingdoms is the war and peace of china excellent and fascinating read but youll need to read an analysis after/with each chapter because otherwise youll miss some stuff / a few things wont make sense also understand that it takes massive liberties with the truth but it doesnt matter because it showcases the virtues / vices / way of thinking of china
  also understand that it takes massive liberties with the truth  its not like war and peace is 100 fact either
  dao de ting / tao te ching but its pure fucking mud so get something with a good in depth analysis because thats all youll get from it core philosophy text  id dispute the idea that the daodejing has been a core philosophy book for chinese speakers in any historical sense reading the four books would give a much better idea of philosophy as actually practiced
    pseud pls go2  
    i wasnt trying to imply that the book was originally written to make the sucessors of wei look good but because liu bei / shu were marginally related to the emperor later dynasties had the book rewritten to make shu look like good guys despite this the three brothers of shu and zhuge liang in their fictional sense are still represented by chinese society as the stereotypes of chinese virtues even though the genuine historical counterparts were far from it
    you sound more knowledgeable than myself so ill bow to your opinion ive only dabbled in chinese lit out of curiosity and op wasnt getting much of a response
are there ideal translations of the classic four
  well people always recommend the newest ones   there are also editions available by the foreign language press which are good though people say they are not easy to read and a bit more rigid in syntax
people too stupid to get a book calling it a meme  art of war is unironically one of the only chinese books worth reading since 89 of their culture burned to ashes centuries ago
im a freshmen in college and honestly id like to expand my mind ive honestly not read many books ive come to the realization not that im a simpleminded uneducated young man with no capacity for higher level thinking or independent thought where should i start
  honestly   thinkingthought    wew lad youre not kidding start with the greeks obviously plato specifically read his shorter dialogues three times each read them alongside companion works then pick some interpretive claim the companion piece makes that you find dubitable and write a careful two page argument against this claim do this for each of the three dialogues you have chosen    doing this with plato is step one just keep doing this with other philosophers and great literary authors your writing thinking and argumentation abilities will improve dramatically     follow the formula of immersing yourself in a primary work immersing yourself in a scholarly interpretation of it and carefully writing a response to this scholarship and youll be on your way to thinking and writing like a beast
  sorry for the mistakes finals has been taking and im not exactly at peak performance rn thank you for the advice

  im a freshmen  ok
  computer engineering along with some business courses its not too diffucult theres just much more coursework to do than im used to i came out of a very small high school in the midwest was not prepared for this year its mainly the reason why i came here the adjustment has been a wakeup call
  im also typing on a new phone that has a much smaller space to type in so bear with the misspellings please

western esotericism a guide for the perplexed by wouter hanegraaffide  ride the tiger by julius evola  man and his symbols by carl g jung  the dialogue by catherine of siena  the chemical wedding by lindsay clarke  complete hypnotism mesmerism mindreading and spiritualism by a alpheus  alices adventures in wonderland by lewis carroll
  youd likely be best suited focusing on your coursework then desu the advice youll receive here would set you on a path that would take your focus away from things like computer eng and business i mean my best advice for learning how to think would be to switch majors into philosophy but this would be terrible career advice
  magic and mysticism are the most embarrassing resentmentfuelled copes
i used to think that starting with the greeks was a meme but symposium specifically made me fall in love i didnt realize how compelling or how fucking funny they could be ive devoured pretty much everything contemporary but never bothered going back because i assumed plato and aristophanes would be as boring as the bible
  try actually studying your course work instead of reading novels or philosophy that likely wont be much use to you  if you want to expand your mind you should do it through experience of the real world and maybe psychedelics
  plato and aristophanes are eternal fucking lanterns in the dark of human life
    cant even finish his sentences  damn is this the power of american higher education
take the /lit/pill
  ive been studying for 6 hours may i have a pass just this once
  sounds like somebody is projecting
  yeah its definitely the successful and socially welladjusted people who read old nonsense tomes about alchemy and cast spells on their bullies
  lol is that why youre so bitter somebody cast a curse on you
  im bitter because people provoke me ritualistically and methodically 16 hours in the day
  sorry man im a dick on these forums i legit feel that way about magic but everyone has different interests and if thats yours all the more power to you i still dont think mysticism magic and esoterica are good recommendations for a dude looking to learn how to think better
  itll make more sense if you read that first guide i listed and jung    not a single magic spell in both
  easy now
  fuck the usa and fuck drumpff
  id like to expand my mind  dude
even if the prince is a work of satire isnt it still an invaluable masterpiece of genuine political science
why is it considered a satire
  yes because he moved the study of politics from the question of how things should be to how things really are
also dont forget his commentaries on first ten books of livy  invaluable in understanding the maestro
  haha
    some people believe the prince was satire its a hot take honestly more likely machiavelli was just poking some fun at his patrons considering his advice was in fact practical and rulers who followed his guidelines tended to be fairly successful historically
  because people havent read any actual satire from the renaissance period to know what the prince would have read like had it actually been satire
  why do you fucking retards think it was satire god fucking damn it
    rousseau got that ball rolling i think in the social contract he evaluated the prince as having a hidden message based on his choice of borgia as a subject for his study whom rousseau personally despised
  its just those with an immature outlook thinking out of work machiavelli closely studying livy and other books would waste his time writing a satire
  there is a footnote in the social contract where rousseau says that machiavelli pretended to write a book for kings when he actually wrote a basic manual for republicans  and he is quite right it is mind boggling to see so many people thinking that machiavelli was some sort of brutal monarchy advocate like for fucks sake have you even read what he wrote its like   oh so you want to be a good prince aye  ok heres what you have to do  destroy all rich fuckers  be an ally to the people  create institutions that allow popular participation  be good for the masses  build some fucking roads you twat  also if you want a succesuff empire you should establish a republic following the roman model  thats literally his thing just fucking read him he was a genius and discourses  prince
  people thinking that machiavelli was some sort of brutal monarchy advocate  do you think in this context prince means son of a king
  no but monarchy means that one has power
  yes yes it is not precisly power it is one who is first but whatever
  so what is your point do you believe there are people who believe machiavelli was a monarchist who has ever said such a thing
  whats it like to be retarded reddit
  niccolo easy on the hardnosed realism
  well that is how rousseau said he was understood social contract iii 6 and fnxxi and that is one of the impressions that i get people have of him when i talk about it        you tell me
  god the prince and the social contract are such good books best read after a survey of historical texts for greece and rome
   the prince is really good and discourses is fucking great but i dont like the social contract to be quite honest
  that is one of the impressions that i get people have of him when i talk about it  for reals like they actually think hes in favour of kings and queens and shit
  not vehemently but yes last time i talked about him with someone that actually read him this thing came out and she defended her posture with all of the borgiaposting machiavelli does in the prince
  also with the last chapter of the prince where he advocates for medici to take control over italy
  she
  humanities library  not full of women
its an extremely mediocre piece of political skullduggery
  dumb platonist scum
there is absolutely nothing in the bible that implies god is omnipotent he has been fooled by mankind and controlled by his own emotions it makes sense that he is a powerful yet flawed deity just like in every other religion that came before christianity and judaism

since i made an effort to read more this year ive read one flew over the cuckoos nest notes from underground the stranger metamorphoses and other stories the great gatsby and dubliners i enjoyed notes from underground and dubliners the most has anyone got any recommendations for what i should read next
  what did you like about them will recommend accordingly
    you could try doing the raper in the rye
  if you liked notes try hunger by hamsun get a collection of stories from anton chekhov if you liked dubliners glad you recognized the supremacy of europoor literature over american

the man finished the book he closed the pages tightly together then put one foot on the floor then the other then used his hands to push himself up out of the chair and then put one foot in front of the other until he had walked all the way to the book shelf and then put the book on the book shelf the deer walked in the man whirled around and fired once with his pistol and the brains of the deer went flying out the back of its head and painted the wall a color dark red like blood the man sat down again like a man sitting down    i didnt really like the book said the dead deer    i reckon i was pretty conflicted replied the man grimly    his writing style is pretty problematic    i reckon his style is perty silly he just strings a bunch of them declarative statements together like the man did this then the man did that etc but they dont paint no picture theyre done totally unevocative of anything i reckon it dont take no skill to just state in excessive detail what someone is doing it takes artistic skill to say it in a way that done bring it to life for the reader and he dont done really do that i reckon its some subhemingway shit hes doing    its not all bad though    i reckon some some of the images twere pretty powerful    and the judge is a memorable character    i reckon hes the only one though all the rest of them there characers aint real memorable like he done put no effort into em cause he spent all his time on the judge and that there whole novel was allwhatdjacallit structureless and stuff and real repetitiv too    i read that he doesnt see why people like proust and james because he thinks all novels should be about life and death things    i reckon thats cause hes too obsessed with subject matter and not enough with style and art    the dead deer nodded and walked out the man slowly got up again by putting one foot then the other on the floor and then used his hands to push himself up out of the chair he fixed himself a drink and resolved not to take anymore book recommendations from harold bloom

probably the world as will and representation  hes got quite a few scattered references to buddhism and hinduism in paregra and paralipomena
essay homo
    i think volume 2 of wwr to the best of my memory     he was writing and revising that relatively late in life the third edition was published just before his death if i recall and by that time he had assimilated more buddhist ideas though he might not always explicitly reference buddhism as the source of his later ideas to the later flavor of his ideas i think youre more likely to find implicit and explicit influences of buddhism the later you look     a helpful article on this is the influences of eastern thought on schopenhauers doctrine of the thinginitself by moira nicholls which is chapter 6 of the cambridge companion to schopenhauer    happy misery to you anon

please recommend antidemiurge lit
it might be a good idea if you sought to better your understanding of philosophy in general rather than asking for literature that is based off a meme you like
  he wants out of the matrix why do you condescend to him he cares not for philosophy that is but a product of the demiurges grasp on our world such as the philosophies of schopenhaur nietzche and virtually all of postmodernism and anything being published today be it fiction nonfiction or philosophy    good for you anon you wish to see outside this dimension of suffering i recommend all of jesuss words all of platos words all of the bhagavad gita as much as you can read of buddhas words and anything else that interests you related to these remember you are not this body  you are consciousness eternal and always in union with the divine all of the philosophies ive given to you will tell you clearly not to attach to this physical body of yours and make your soul a slave to its many vulgar demands eating drinking the expulsion of these pain and pleasure are the realm of body know your soul to be beyond these and as the ruler of the body not the other way    good luck op you can do it
  the lightning and the sun    adolf hitler the ultimate avatar    theozoology    the myth of the 20th century
  because the low effort of his post belies his lack of knowledge on the subject you say he wants out of the matrix but it seems to me all he has done is rehash a memetic trope devoid of value or substance    you say i condescend to him but it is not i who is pushing him towards ideas he may very well not be ready for if a person simply jumps into the works you recommend is not able to comprehend and ultimately gives up on grasping the truth behind them altogether is that not a great tragedy i only demand of him what he must demand of himself if he is to have any chance of success
  i understand and i was mistaken you sought for the op to be more specific in his searchings and felt he knew nothibg of what he asked for on this you might be right and yet as the possible novice he may be i know of no other way to satisfy his query but to give him the information i did if you know of more accessible texts please give them to him i think that if he commits the resources i told to him will be a great step into the mindset hes trying to embody and still encourage he read it even if he does not fully grasp it sorry if you thought i was being mean to you

  read howl if you like it read more ginsberg keruac ect if you dont give up on beats
her by lawrence ferlinghetti
  not op but i read howl and got bored should i give it another go or is it just the kind of thing you either get or dont
big sur by kerouac    read junky before you read naked lunch    howl by ginsberg will suffice
  get or dont in my experience
  i would suggest on the road before big sur reason being is that big sur has more to do with delirium tremendous brought on by alcoholism than it has to to with the beat lifestyle i think kerouac was already in his 40s when big sur took place he was already burnt out and suffering through past decisions and new fame on the road is more entry level

  seriously why has canada seemingly failed to produce anything of great literary value  the population is small but not enough to explain how tragic the essential reading on the wiki is compared to other countries i dont think  im not a big fan of american lit and i can still name at least 20 american books better than all of pic related off the top of my head
  small population  no history    american lit was born out of the huge populations desire for an identity even if that desire is present in canada it doesnt have enough talented people or been independent for enough time for good lit
  the holohoax
  because you have no history and culture
  canada is where asians go to start over   theres no culture it is a dumping ground for asians and their business
  and not even cool asians cool asians stay in their own countries like japan to make cool culture but rather weak excuses of human beings are the ones that get to japan
  im seriously interested in your project anon id love to give it a read or edit     re canada and   longfellows evangeline is criminally underrated         the general issue is a lack of care what ever great works we have are neglected while our lack of support fails to encourage great artistic endeavour i mean didnt richler leave canada because he thought no one gave a shit     also i highly recommend robert w service and archibald lampman

  anglo colonies im not referring to the us have all develops an antiintellectual culture that makes people unwilling to dedicate themselves to the arts in a nonironic way     that is due to the destruction of the anglo class hierarchy for example even upper class australians will resemble the british working class more than anything else
  hey cool i guess we can get into a little literay competition of whos crowned the great canadian novelist
  dunno if youre right but thats interesting hadnt considered australian literature and what ive seen of their culture fits what you say as well  for what its worth im a brit myself and ive noticed a similar kind of antiintellectualism among by very middle class peers and i dont think my country has produced much of literary value since the war

based brothers grimm here in germany
  brothers grimm  these are fairy tales our national epic is the song of the nibelungs du nasenbär
  great post
  that was written by a canadian and is unironically bretty gud
  i thought you guys had the iliad
  canadian is a negative identity it doesnt say what you are it says what you are not you are not american canada is extremely spread out and 95 of it is uninhabitable furthermore it had no founding ideals or national movements like the united states because of this any cultures that exist within canada are very small and regionalist finally canada is poor relative to the united states and it is a smaller market so there is little incentive to produce culture specifically for canada its not like say in germany where you have 80 million germans and its your native language so you might as well in canada you probably speak english and you have an english speaking market literally 10x bigger than your home country ten minutes south of where you grew up  finally canadas population is becoming increasingly urban and its cities are indistinguishable from the united states anyways a kid growing up in vancouver has infinitely more in common with a kid in sf than even a kid in chiliwack or barrie canadas window to grow into its own culture has closed becoming more and more like america is inevitable and frankly is almost complete
  leaves of grass
  not being american is a negative identity     you see where youre going wrong here right the problem with our country is that population growth without immigration has stagnated if we werent accepting so many immigrants our population would literally start decreasing thats why this country is considered a haven for immigrants and multiculturalism how many brown people do your major cities have thats what sets canadian culture apart from america this probably also has to do with liberals supporting the minority more than majority but its not canadian culture thats dying its white culture and im sure it was the same problem in america until trump got elected
  how the fuck will more white babies invalidate anything i said we didnt produce shit in the last 100 years when we were 90 white and growing
  martín fierro for argentina dont know about the others
  the song of the nibelungs  wagner  fuck off nazi
  literally just the 2nd amendment
  taking this bait i just clarify as a welcoming gesture to all nongermanofags that the saga is medievil while wagner wrote his work in the 19th century prior to all nazism
tfw your country has two equally goat national epics

i am looking for books that can guide me toward experiencing the infinitely unfolding hyperfactal pluralmonad positivevoid that is the foundation of reality
just do shrooms if thats what you really want
  i despise fungus
  dmt 60x salvia extracts 600uq lsd doses 4th plat dxm 7 gs of shrooms pick your poison    dont bitch me out if you do this and it fries you beyond recovery
  what the fuck does hyperfactal mean
    then do lsd
  looking for books read the question before answering please
can we get a thread for some books suggestions for young readers my nephew is 7 and we like to read together but everywhere i look for new chapter book suggestions for him lists harry potter and some other popular series over and over can you recommend any oneoff chapter books for that age range not part of a series
d i n o t o p i a    might actually be a bit advanced for him maybe kiplings just so stories or pooh
  unironically captain underpants
  treasure island
  diaries of a wimpy kid
children should be cuddles not educated
  magic treehouse books they are part of a series but you can start anywhere same goes for hardy boys
kate dicamillo the second grade teacher does an author study on several of her books because of winn dixie and the miraculous journey of edward tulane are my personal favorites but the tale of despereaux is also good
  start him with the greeks
my nephew 6 asked me to read him a story the other day but his books were shit so i ended up recounting the plot of warcraft 3 to him which he seemed to enjoy
  dont waste your time kids dont give a shit about books and if you make them read theyll just hate you for cutting into their fortnite time
rules for a knight  cs lewis  tolkein  arthurian legend  local mythology  raise a young reactionary op
  i loved captain underpants id rec this too    magic treehouse was also good
  great suggestion i remember reading those when i was young however i cant find an ebook    he liked the movie and i got him a couple of the books he read the first but has lost interest in it for now at least    weve read that one picked it up because he loved muppet treasure island so much    ill admit i sort of gloss over those when im looking maybe i should pick one up to see if they pique his interest    have one of those queued up for when were finished reading our current book odd and the frost giants    he loved the tale of despereaux and i have edward tulane on queue for the next bedtime story book
  i unironically agree to an extent the first few were genuinely good and the realisation that greg heffley is a cunt is one of the biggest epiphanies a zoomer can have but he definitely milked the series and you definitely definitely dont want your kid only reading diary of a wimpy kid also stay far away from all other diary of a _______ books like minecraft zombie and farting pikachu thats real look it up
  i really enjoyed reading barbar as a kid  adventures of tintin  muppets christmas carol mobir was really great but reading the actual story was a bit too advance for me as a kid
  and then arthas murdered everyone in stratholme  even the women and children  especially the women and children for their wickedness they were sickly and needed to be purged like the contemporary left
    if hes looking for a similar feel to dicamillo try the wild robot by peter brown it was a read aloud in my third grade classroom last fall and the kiddos loved it
give him the gift off absolute kino i remember staying up all night in my blanket teepee reading these books by flashlight i would have been about his age    i would also recommend redwall but its hard for me to remember those books with the same fondness knowing what the furries did to them
i dont know arent there tons of other books out there
little prince  also skip all let him start with crime n punishment
  this    robinson crusoe  treasure island  a childs history of england  dickens  definitely the odyssey and the iliad asap

  oh good i like him even more now
is alan watts worth reading if so what should i start with by him ive listened to bits and pieces of some of his lectures and he intrigues me  inb4 start with the greeks  i did
dude fuck public schools lmao
  okay then defend public schools
  fuck off neoboomer we arent in 1960s california anymore
mr watts  id say hes a better lecturer than a writer try the taboo of knowing yourself zen  is more an experience delivered best in lecture rather than through text
  as with capitalism generally money allows talent to flourish
  i really enjoyed psychotherapy east and west got me through a tough time when i was younger and helped me see things a little differently would recommend
  im 21 retard    thanks anon    ill check this one out too thanks anon
  im 21 retard  boomerism is a state of mind not a generational marker also reading watts wont help you get asian women
  the actual eastern texts are way better just listen or read watts as a way to familiarize yourself with the concepts in the texts so when you actually read them you are not lost
read his autobiography dude was absolutely based episcopalian buddhish taoish alcoholic who loved the bitches i know a guy whose mom dated alan watts they used to wrestle
  check out the book on the taboo against knowing who you are its a light read and a decent dip into his main ideas/viewpoint
  dude depopulate the third world lol
  check out his last book tao    also read some zhuangzi    he started with zen but ended up at taoism
looking for some /lit/ tv shows to watch when i need a break from reading i started this today its skullface bookseller hondasan about a skeleton that works in a bookstore
  degenerate
he doesnt know about /lit/ the anime
  this anime is for degenerate perverts if we lived in saner times anime fans would be dragged into the streets and flogged alongside furries and trannies
    wrong
got a classic for you
  the day of the rope cometh
  no u
  its about a comic book store half the episodes are about foreigners buying yaoi  watch  instead i wish i had the whats the appropriate distance to keep from haruki murakami screencap saved
    ive heard this show was good ill start it today thanks anons    i didnt know war and peace had a tv adaptation
  truly /lit/ incarnate
  guns germs and steel
  i bet you havent even read that
  whats the name
anime is stupid and i hate it every time i think ive finally found the one good anime it ruins itself with dumb weeb shit    a genius narcissist finds a magic book that can turn him into a mortal version of the god of death he decides to rule the world as a god by destroying all the people he sees as immoral but hes being chased by another genius narcissist working for the good guys we watch the elaborate and cutthroat mind games the two play with each other better have a submissive jpop idol lick his boots and tell him how sexy he is every other scene better have him throw the book away the only thing he cares about to save his father whos only ever been a pawn to him because kira is a kawaii anime protagonist and not an megalomaniacal madman    the last humans on earth are holed up in a walled city defending themselves against an enemy that they have no hope of defeating only the rangers can fight them but every victory is pyrrhic just one more shuffling step towards extinction the walls are their only defense and we quickly learn that its not going to be enough humanity is facetoface with oblivion lol actually its about a team of teenage mech pilots that fight mutants and everything interesting about the setup is a lie
  miss bernard said
  fune wo amu    its about a guy working at a publishing company writing dictionaries
  anime is the same shit over and over for quite literally decades     there are some that more unique than others try acca i thought it was unique for anime not for the artstyle or characters or story but for the simple fact that everything gets tied together in a coherent narrative theres no bullshit tropes inserted just because its anime and no filler whatsoever despite being a complete series anime is often basically just standalone eps that vaguely build on the previous
  death note is very good despite the cringe shit    cant you say that about every form of storytelling media everythings the same story arc type shit with a different twist
  champloo is p good
  this was legit funny spoonfeed me whats this called i did a reverse image search on the previous screenshot and all i got was december 23rd
  plot  guns germs and steel
  /lit/  tv shows    pick one
  wow what a retard   
  miss bernard said  thanks my dude desu i saw this reply and thought it meant that miss bernard had said what the anime was called it didnt know what that meant so i forgot about it
  the young pope
  when i first watched that it was with my friend who doesnt browse /lit/ and he just couldnt understand why i thought it was so funny but it was because i was laughing at you fucks

  you ok oniichan
the leftovers
  top kek this is the most /lit/ show to exist im halfway through the series and every episode makes me think of this board
  it even has an /sffg/ character
bump
  i already told you earlier the young pope
  is this music edited in  
i dont get it compared to other philosophical/religious works ive read this seems so vague that you could make up any interpretation you want and it would fit same goes with the i ching too is there some extra material one needs to read in order to truly understand classical chinese lit
  read the zhuangzhi and the liehtzu to gain a better understanding of taoism then go back and read the tao teh ching
  is there some extra material    you need to sit out in the forest with the cute critters in peace and quiet in order to get it
  this the zhuangzi is honestly a lot better and more important to taoism than the tao te ching
boy this chong chi ching book sure is dumb
  wrong every noob thinks this same thing though      read it as it is do not to try to search for deeper meaning do not read intepretations or stupid religious folk shit just read the goddamn book and stop looking for deeper meaning its not vague at all its exactly what it says read the first line until you understand
  its bad i much prefer the i ching zhuangzi is also a lot better but for roughly the same type of style the i ching absolutely shits all over the tao te ching for the record my favorite writer in the warring states period is xunzi and han feizi did nothing wrong    i read addisslombardos translation iirc star is a faggot
  dude this book is just excellent youre thinking about it the wrong way to categorize it as vague the book describes ultimate general principals of life in the world being open to creative interpretation is the main strength of this piece you cant think about it as equivalent to some piece of european philosophy aspiring for exactitude category definition precision etc it will probably be most useful to you as a primer for insight into the patterns of your own life or human life in general
  i think youre going about trying to understand these works the wrong way the ttc and i ching are not meant to be a big treatise of the world or something like that theyre expressions of ancient chinese thought and worldview in general you should try to look through these texts instead of into them think about what you can infer about the greater cultural outlook of ancient chinese civilization rather than try to distill a specific logical argument about the world that the author is trying to communicate that is doubly true for the iching
  completely cut off
    it is very open to interpretation but im not really interested in coming up with my own i want to know what they thought about it so i can understand their worldview ive been reading some buddhist scriptures recently and in comparison to that it seems more of an entry level work full of banal platitudes and metaphysical concepts that arent explained im looking for something with a bit more meat on it
what font is best for novels what font do you write in why are curly quotation marks superior
  any simple noncartoonish legibleat10por11p sans serif font is good enough
garamond
  sans serif font
  sans serif
  i rather enjoy liberation serif 105 font i like the feet on characters rn and m look dissimilar enough to not cause confusion with quick reading and the dot in fi doesnt merge with the f like in many other collegerequired fonts
  what fonts even have curlyquotes i had a look at the most common print fonts garamond times roman minion etc today and in all of them the quotation marks looked quite straight
  font
  what word do you prefer typeface
a writer must be compassionate  spends his life fucking thousands of bitches and cucking tons of other guys even seducing his own married professor in med school  62 gigachad with high iq and brooding good looks    hmm really makes you think
    any particular biography of him you recomend
  he was a doctor tho
  care to prove he ever wrote anything
  who is this guy why should i care is he even a writer how is this /lit/related
  seducing his own married professor in med school  hmmmm really make me think
  is it really necessary to tell everyone you are an uneducated swine
  is it really necessary to know every picture of every idiot someone on an anonymous chilean circumcisiontechnique forum likes to talk about
  absolutely not but is it really necessary to tell everyone you are an uneducated swine
    cringe bet you are german this is their typical funny way of being pompous rude im gonna fuckin stretch ya on the wrack and lick your thighs til you cant take it no more
    being this new
  actually im the guy he accuses of being uneducated and im german    i would have been able to work with the name chekhov but i have never seen a picture of the guy before and i literally hold a ba in literature
   right click   search google for image   first result    fuck you knuckledragging halfwits really grind my gears    anyway opie theres a long tradition of writers aspiring to lofty moral ideals both for themselves and the species and inevitably falling short of them     you seem to be imply that his hypocrisy here is a byproduct of some sort of craven manipulation and i find that hard to believe theres a yearning in his work that i think would be hard to fake  human atomization clearly tortured him and i imagine his failures as a man did as well
  this is a picture of anton chekhov anon he was a great russian playwright and short story writer from the late 19th century and one of my favorite authors you should read him as soon as you get the chance you wont regret it have a nice day
  literally what i did to find out its chekhov but it is your job to make a somewhat useful thread not mine to know about every thing some idiot might make a thread about
  a writer must be compassionate  seducing his own married professor in med school  not chekhov  what was your thesis in literature hans something about american classics
  i didnt make the thread retardto recap   act like a retard   get called out by multiple people for being retarded   continue to sperg because i was labeled accurately in accordance with my behavior   shit up a perfectly decent thread due to slights both perceived and intended    i ironically hate your guts
  something about this guy      who cares
  i dont hate germans i love u be my bf
  chilean circumcisiontechnique  we are all catholics so mostly uncut cock here get your facts straight pal
  his definition of compassion involved clinical observation of both vices and virtues and treated vices and virtues alike for me that was what made his works so fascinating to read   for example tolstoy knew that the peasants can be unpleasant but at the same time acknowledge their good and honest nature so when he wrote about their vices there was restraints  maybe it was not actual restraint but the lack of compassion that made those flaws more tolerable to tolstoy   but chekhov he shitted on them ruthlessly when describing their vices however he also fleshed out their virtues in the same manner like in the short story my life  my favorite of his character building was the woman in the short story a trivial incident he made sure that his readers aware of how ugly she was almost constantly it was as if he forgot to attack her appearance for an instance the readers may fall in love with her and may elevate her to a level she was made unworthy of due to her appearance it was absolutely devastating and wonderful
  tolstoy was a cuck to the peasants unable to write about them with verity because of his obnoxious class anxiety
  how did he have class anxiety
    bump because chekhov is one of the greatest writers of all time together with tolstoy and shakespeare
  magarshack is fantastic
  youre forgetting he treated the poor for free built schools mentored younger writers and advocated prison reform after witnessing firsthand how brutal conditions were in sakhalin guy was a saint and immeasurably more tolerable than almost every other writer in history as though anyone want to sit down with tolstoy dostoevsky or nabokov
giorgio agambens selfportrait in the studio is thoughtful sincere and inspiring go read it if you can    pic related its observational subject
  that is a seriously nice shelf i want one just like it
anything more useless than the ruminations of a bourgeois postmarxist
  its a biographical piece
been interested in agamben since someone said hes like carl schmitt what should i read of him other than selfportrait he has a lot of books
   other than selfportrait  the joke is that you can only read it in italian spanish and russian at the moment    start with collections of essays proceed to major professionally heavier to read works
agamben is cringe  muh warburg  muh holy refugees  muh biopolitics  muh benjamin  muh philology    your bookshelves are cringe
  thats agambens actual room if you cant guess it from his family photos    im also quite sceptical about your ability to catch the essence of his works based on the list youve provided
  agamben is cringe  stop youre devaluing my shelves dont you know i need the social currency of my shelf pic    anyway as someone who swore an oath to serve i enjoyed an archaeology of the oath
  omg thats even worse    the most prominent european continental philosopher puts up fucking altars devoted to favourite peeps  plath  oh no no no no    no wonder anglo postcontinentals are gaining traction youre too busy sucking dead cocks
    unironically having shitty spinoza and walter benjamin pictures on your shelf     i like agambens work but my god this is the purest of ideologies
  will you go bonkers if i tell you that the book is technically mostly descriptions of his favourite peeps
  yeah ill go and call it pseudcore    doesnt matter if he studied under heidegger a while
  your posts for one
what is africanamerican literature
check out ishmael reed
  off the top of my head  fredrick douglass  ralph ellison  james baldwin  chester himes  toni morrison  just some writers ive read and enjoyed
  is it about his transation to becoming a woman
  there has never been a good africanamerican writer theyre all obsessed with muh oppression  prove me wrong
  blues lyrics
  be black  take the advice to write what you know  still happening in 2018
  your premise presupposes that addressing oppression is the sign of a poor writer which is an unsubstantiated claim
  no my critique is that no nigger has ever ventured beyond that point which leads to a creative standstill
  what about octavia butler zora neal hurston and the afore mentioned ishmael reed you dumb cunt
  because all of the great africanamerican writers were actually oppressed
  ventured beyond that point  what do you mean by this  which leads to a creative standstill  how so
  name five africanamerican writers which you have read
  oppression is a big part of their history so it is no reason to criticize them when they address it     anyway some good writers  ntozake shange  ishmael reed  cornell west  langston hughes  frantz fanon
  adding to this list if youre not familiar with jean toomer i highly recommend giving him a try hughes was convinced that he was going to be the next american vanguard of literary modernism
  cool i will lately i have been enjoying the black modernists/postmodernists a lot mostly because i didnt come from the middle classes and most of the other serious fiction writers do its hard to identify with their lives
is it possible to read a book by a black woman and not have if not a major story point then at least one large paragraph devoted to her hair
  is it possible to read a book by a white man and not have to read about his angst
  physical and emotional descriptions are different things one borders the fetishistic the other one is common theme in literature and im not even female nor black nor white
  name five types of organic waste you have ingested
  oppression is a big part of their history  its literally their identity the black american identity is inextricably based around the act of complaining ideally about white people    to be a sullen brown bitch is to be a black american if you are not whiny and pitching a temper tantrum or at least sympathetic to those who are you cannot be a black american these people have for the entirety of their existence defined themselves by their proximity to and distance from white people this is the sole and central facet of their being or their soul they are a people who exclusively exist in opposition to whiteness    if the nappyheaded negroid is not complaining he does not exist but the negroid complains therefore he is
  its good because its common  how many times do i have to read a 19th century white man describe the furniture in a room    black man bad
  black people talk about tables and chairs
  my point is that there are a lot of different tropes and they are a little annoying but maybe they are necessary to disarm the reader somehow or maybe they are just filler
        imagine being this guy
  if youre interested in more postmodern/contemporary black writers also check out claudia rankines citizen and fran rosss oreo these books couldnt be further apart in terms of tone but are both fantastic reads nonetheless
  a complete failure
  thanks for the recommendations i am definitely trying to get more into contemporary writers why bewail the death of literature if all we do is pick its bones
we are the most powerful race but were eternally victims  repeat ad nauseum for literal hundreds of years
  this
american literature  let alone nigger american literature    lmao
is there any good fiction about pornography
  i see your point but we just had the one who shot her face off  this one is to cleanse the palate
  pornography is one of the worst things for your mind worse than opiates harder to quit than opiates too enjoy being slow and hypersexualized the rest of your life and a slave to your lower instincts instead
  raaaaid    poof
  enjoy being slow and hypersexualized the rest of your life and a slave to your lower instincts instead  youre kind of undermining your own argument by browsing imageboards which we only do to receive quick doses of dopamine just like with masturbating  also everyone is a slave to their passions as hume said we cant escape being human
  how come her anus its as beautiful as her cutie face
  yeah stormfags raid apparently
  im so tired of celibate posters and their popsci bullshit please show me a scientific study that proves porn makes you slow or less productive people like you are worse than fireandbrimstone preachers becuase at least they try to argue for the existence of god instead of just parroting the same 7 talking points every day non fucking stop
  can you share it with the rest of the class for research purposes
  what ive read of peter sotos is pretty good disgusting and depressing but good
  the greeks knew
  share it motherfucker  i demand a link now
  tlps book if he ever publishes it
  obligatory
  we put our hearts in this movie
  just had the one who shot her face off  huh
  who is she
are her lips naturally fucked up or is this the result of botched surgery
  culture of critique
  lip augmentation with artefill or prolonged vacuum pump scar tissue buildup not sure which not a sign of beauty crude sexual appeal thats it
  lana rhoades she is hideous now though
  at least you admit its fiction
  porn sites are just the supply answering for the demand its not like they have to do any mass advertising or employ any kind of devious tricks to get to us people need sex and its their own fault if they resort to pornography
  it bothers me to think of all the porn actresses names i remember such a waste of mental space
  how the hell does pornography make money there cant be that many people actually paying for shit
  humans dont need sex it is not a necessity you can go without it indefinitely without issue
  people need sex and its their own fault if they resort to pornography  but most men start watching porn when theyre like 12 or 13 way before most people start having sex by the time people are having sex pornography has already become entrenched as a method for sexual satisfaction its not like porn is there for lonely people the idea is that porn is making people lonely

  when jews took over gaza one of the first things they did was start airing porn 24/7 on palestinian tv stations  based and e michael jonespilled but in all seriousness porn is the only thing jews will give away for free because it helps every other industry they own
  it does not make a lot of money but mindgeek the parent company above bought up profitable sites during the late/early 2000s so they have all there bases covered in most genres/fetishs to top that off they bought up most of the tube sites too which they actively police for their own content while ignoring content from other companies being uploaded on their own tubes unless a dmca is filed to top it all off they only run ads on tube sites for paysites that the parent company mindgeek owns which directs anyone surfing tubes who may be inclined toward paying to one of their websites and away from competition     this is literally the only way to make profit of nonfetish mainstream porn anymore and they dont even make all that much considering the only other way is to make very niche fetish content that big studios pass over this is how girls shooting in their bed room can turn a profit by pretending to be a giant peanut butter sandwich with a strap on who is going to peg you etc
  not actually true very few jewish rackets make money and are only purported to because they are propped up by jewishcontrolled wall street and overvalued despite not producing shit the media the publishing industry the music industry these stopped making money long ago and jews despite what you hear are not actually good with money because like everything its just a tool to increase their power thats why the us is 21 trillion in debt they have no fucking clue how to run anything they are nomadic con artists
  so its actually like  says its more of a cultural control thing
  i can get behind this
  i did double anal  mandingo in one day  why does this make me laugh so much
  there is more
and another
  funny thing is that this hoe easily could have been an instathot if she didnt butcher herself
  imagine being this deluded
  imagine being this addicted
  this but unironically
  is there any good fiction about pornography  try penthouse letters
  idk rachel from down the street is pretty cute and friendly maybe you just need to get laid lol
  sauce
  south american cartels run the drug business but you wouldnt blame them if your friend overdosed would you
  we work so hard  do they even have a concept of what working hard means
  yes
  why dont they do that shit that the guy deom gloryholeswallow does apparently every video becomes traceable and he just sues whoever shares it
  danny wyldes books are actually decent apparently    google image search has a feature built into the site use it
  they dont push it on kids porn is more addictive than drugs too
  literal 10/10 what did she do to herself
  animals dont need sex at all  yes they do  oh so youre an addict then xd  brainlet
  which drug business the jewish sackler family / purdue pharma created the opiate epidemic and own the treatment patent for it most of the heroin those white people move to after being unable to afford the pills also comes from afghanistan and is flown in by the cia/mossad so there is sure to be a heavy jewish hand involved there too
  they dont push it on kids  yes they do    porn is more addictive than drugs too  a heroin addict doesnt care about porn
  npc logic and appeal to nature  looking to nature animals only procreate in certain seasons generally unless theyre in a man made artificial environment its humans who pervert the generative function and try to repeat it as frequently as possible to turn their junk into a source of endless entertainment
  if twelve year olds start browsing porn its their retard parents fault for allowing them on the internet unsupervisioned kids should not be allowed to own a smartphone or tablet but hey societal pressure
  huur the only purpose of sex is to reproduce sex for any other reason is npc logic  do you not see the irony sex for purpose of reproduction and reproduction alone is peak npc  sheldon ass nigger
  unsupervisioned  yeah im really going to take you seriously now
  have you ever taken double anal  mandingo in one day i honestly think you dont know what working hard means
  such a stupid libertarian perspective that keeps hyperindividualist loners detached from having any connection to their own society and culture and in turn gives a green light to outsider tribes like jews to run roughshod over it kill yourself buddy
  lower instincts  please explain what the higher instinct are and why the desire for reproduction is not one of the fundamental desires of all living creatures and should be repressed
  thats my point that they dont push the drugs on anybody they just supply them for the people who gulp them down and beg for more its the same with porn nobody pushes it on anybody it simply shortcircuits something in the human brain the issue is that this thing is made possible by the technological age
  calls out an appeal to nature  immediately proceeds to make a point based on an appeal to nature  imagine being this much of a fucking pseud holy shit    humans arent seasonal breeders we feel the urge to reproduce all year round and that pursuit is rewarded with tingly genitals and an orgasm whether weve corrupted that process or not is irrelevant to whether we actually need sex or not go play with your katanas
why read fiction about pornography when you can read fiction as pornography/pornographic fiction
bump
  they dont push it on kids  this is a meme pushed by godfathers real drug dealers dont give a shit
  slave to their passions  storking your halfnumb dick with deathgrip while watching better endowed man take turns on a woman you find attractive  yeah thats what he meant and its totally the same type of dopamine rush you get from shitposting on imageboards
  stunning and brave such an inspiration to young girls everywhere
  i should have chosen to read a better thread
gang bang by chuck palahniuk a fun little novel if you ask me
  i thought at least some of them were made by russians working for western front company
  i wouldnt be addicted to pornography if women would just stop being so picky and stop having unrealistic standards   inb4 oonly men should lower their standards iincel
  imagine being that conservative idiot who doesnt even understand you can honestly talk to children in advance and resorts to failed prohibitions
    everything a human likes to do is likeable because of dopamine the thing about masturbation and drugs is that the doses of dopamine are higher making other great things pale in comparison  drugs and masturbation are highly destructive passions they dont make you grow as a person      everytime you cum your body needs to synthesize some more sperm make millions of cells from your blood cells it requires energy  besides that the pleasure you feel is caused by released dopamine masturbation is one of those actions that makes you release the most dopamine not talking about sex here because its more balanced but its also relevant to sex especially when you let yourself cum hsving sex without cumming at least has a point of enjoying your partner having pleasure of sex with you when they enjoy having sex with you they love you emotionally not the most sophisticated kind of love but still its nice to love and be loved this way also its about exchanging each others energies masturbation without cumming is meaningless literally it makes you lack energy once theses no urge to jerk off or to fuck youll feel your inner strength very explicitly  having sex is nice and masturbation while its bad for a human body is a personal choice but both of those get really degenerate when its the main source of pleasure in life same with drugs obviously theres nothing worse than serious lack of balance in life     i wouldnt x if someone y  maybe you should just stop being a child and take responsibility for your own actions this way you might become a more appealing person  also having high standards is absolutely fine you dont like to spend time with shit books do you
  maybe you should just stop being a child and take responsibility for your own actions this way you might become a more appealing person  i already do retard maybe you should be a bit less presumptuous
  also having high standards is absolutely fine  not when youre male according to you progressive and tolerant liberal demagogues
  t porn addict
  cringe  this reads like something a fat woman would right in reverse    your answer is a mutually exclusive choice of  either sex or pornmasturbation  abstinence is not only possible but ideal
didnt chuck palahniuk write a bunch     otherwise just read some classic erotica
  wrong your memelogic reads like a deluded neurotypical chad whos never experienced loneliness
  using hedonism as a void for loneliness is the worst possible thing you can do
  just read some classic erotica  literature about sex is not literature about pornography
she really was beautiful before she fucked it all up that yahoo answers question of hers when she was 14 that people found asking about how to become famous actress is really depressing
  using hedonism as a void for loneliness is the worst possible thing you can do  again spoken like a deluded neurotypical whos never experienced desperation or loneliness
  he thinks only the weakwilled failures of the world have experienced negative emotions    dude you are not especially gifted by the scorn of the universe you just suck at handling it cause you are a dumb bitch
  i have it it was never a solution for anything
  kicking the weak while theyre down  yikes you should work on that shitty personality there buddy       i have  doubt it
  im gonna write some for you op  ill keep you posted
  please post her yahoo answers question
  oh thats what that fucking picture was sheesh delete this entire thread
      sad face
  fag
  how can a 14 years old person who speaks english natively write so poorly i could have done a much better job when i was 14 and all the english i knew was from playing video games
  i believe it is early 2010s teen girl pidgin but who knows
  i recommend that you focus on your academics and grades because in the long run the intelligent actors and actresses rule the spotlight and the stage for example emma watson   that guy went with a really shitty example emma watson was an average child actor who got really fucking lucky and her entire career has been built on the luck that got her a role in harry potter
  that winning answer is way more cringey than the question
  yeah but emma watson requires at least 5mil before she takes two dicks in her ass at the same time which is a big step up
  good luck and i sure do hope you take my advice   wew laddy i wonder if he knows how she turned out
isnt the followup to trainspotting about porn
  wow for 14 youre really pretty i love your eyes   wake me up inside
  this is how girls shooting in their bed room can turn a profit by pretending to be a giant peanut butter sandwich with a strap on who is going to peg you

  implying there arent monkeys jacking it every day and dogs and cats humping shit despite the season
of all members of the mammalian family civilized man alone is a victim of an exaggerated and morbid sexual urge a condition which he has inflicted to a certain extent on the animals which he has domesticated and which have adopted his diet especially the dog wild animals in a state of nature practice copulation only at certain mating seasons for the purpose of reproduction civilized man practices this act at all times and in most cases without intention to conceive on the other hand socalled savages and primitive races leading more natural lives and who follow their natural instincts to a greater extent are far chaste in their sexual behavior as noted by havelock ellis such considerations must lead one to the conclusion that the sex life of civilized men is unnatural and that the excessive manifestation of the sex urge among them is due to certain aphrodisiacal stimuli rather than to natural instinct among such stimuli are a highprotein meat diet accompanied by physical inactivity the use of tobacco alcohol and coffee sexually stimulating literature dramas motion pictures conversation etc for these reasons civilized man has departed from the natural law obeyed by animal and primitive races which requires the separation of the sexes during pregnancy and lactation for the benefit of both mother and child violation of this law may account for the large number of physically and mentally defective offspring produced by civilized races as compared with animals and primitive peoples
  its about fucking time someone shows that masturbation is indeed bad for the brain with a bit of scientific logic  the dopamine that you get from masturbation can even be higher than some true sexual intercourses the brain gets used to high dopamine influx and everything else in life gets bleak and doesnt sound appealing anymore   humanities and art fags will never get this since they dont know shit about how the brain works and use shit philosophies to prove it doesnt matter      wrong your memelogic reads like a deluded neurotypical chad whos never experienced loneliness  stop sperging i spend about 80 of the time alone and it doesnt affect me that much i also know plenty of mates that are my age and havent lost their vcard and also spend even more time alone yet they are perfectly fine you are in this state of mind because your brain doesnt stop thinking about women and caring about what are other people are doing and what they will judge of you stop going to /r9k/ or at least take their shit with a pitch of salt and stop fapping after a few weeks you will eventually stop caring about women so much and feel a bit more motivated to do and learn stuff  always remenber to stay true to your self there is no right way of living life and if you like to spend more time alone than other people then dont feel bad because of it
  damn sure many people died because they didnt empty their balls how tragic
  its not the same desu  humans and most other animals like dogs and cats breed every season because we always have the resources there are species that reproduce more when struggling while other reproduce less each one has diferent strategies  but jumping back into the first argumant anon said sex isnt a need because you dont die from not getting it you dont need it in order to live    inb4 hurr but its necessary to pass down genes and ensure the survival of species  also wrong too much sex and offspring can also lead to mass extinction overpopulation is a serious problem that also can lead to exctintion and has happened in many species
the west is done

  porn is illegal in iceland
  actually women arent picky enough men arent picky enough either  as a consequence there are way too many shitty people around

    you should have started with the greeks specifically you should have thought about the distinction between ερως and επιθυμία that runs throughout most of plato         there are differences in degree but youre right about the quality being similar funny story i watched porn for the first time in some 100110 days today and incidentally it is also the first time i somehow find myself on 4chan since august it operates by the same mechanism turns you into a dopamineprole     as for hume  only the englishman does that the fatalism is pathetic in the undiluted sense of πάσχω         i wouldnt be addicted to pornography if women would just stop being so picky and stop having unrealistic standards     honestly are you for real ive been gone from here so long that a lot of you seem like caricatures you make a choice every time you watch pornography and no one is forcing your hand to type in the name of the website         thank you celibateposter you convinced me to attempt semen retention and i went some 80 days on it it really did change my life for the better im gonna leave 4chan again after this post hopefully permanently     good luck to you all this place is a toxic shithole not worth the one hollow laugh it grants you every few weeks
remember celibate rhymes with celebrate
  look at this cope  i would be cope if i wasnt feeling better and happy than years ago  the choice is yours you have nothing to lose from trying to quit fapping and find better prespectives of life everyone plays with the cards they have im trying to be be sort of useful and help anons try something diferent      i watched porn for the first time in some 100110 days today and incidentally it is also the first time i somehow find myself on 4chan since august  wtf are you 18 or lower or homeschooled  its almost impossible to finish high school without any retard introducing you to porn
i dont think nofap/celibacy is healthy in the long run ive read reports of people having prostate issues having to pee more often  that doesnt mean you should watch porn though
  thats a valid point but where in the internet we are normally talking about excess masturbation with some people nutting 23 times a day every day
  thats a myth celibates actually have lower rates of prostate cancer     dont fall for the sexpositive propaganda

  new lana rhoades is to abstract sexuality as grecoroman statues are to abstract human representation  shes unrealistic but she still gets the job done

  great post
  i try to stay away from it but every couple weeks or so i break down and look at some videos
  resort to nonhardcore nonmoving instead and dont go browsing the videos replay in the subconscious thats why you remember them more vividly and are drawn back to repeat the same mistake ad blocking all thumbnails on this site is prerequisite to successful abstinence
  why is life like this bros
  citation needed
  start by blocking all thumbnails on this site with filters    4chanorg/  4channelorg/    avoid any site with arousing material or if you need to you need to block the specific thumbnails or the entire site it is worth the effort you start using the internet more purposefully and less hedonistically
  enjoy being slow and hypersexualized the rest of your life and a slave to your lower instincts instead  okay

  david hume is by far the most redpilled writer
  sex and character by otto weininger
    what is it that you want to know    believe it or not im one of the principal architects of modern trumpism and am recognized as such depending on what it is that you are searching for i can potentially direct you toward some serious material
  trumpism  redpilled
the human animal was a pretty good read even if you discount its premises
  i disagree with what you say but i will defend to the death your right to say it
  how can you disagree
  nobody has read your book
  any good books on marketing
  read that book it will change your life
  the turner diaries    /thread
    im too busy to type out a list so heres a photo of more general/direct marketing books but these are all primers and starters really and i can offer a whole host of stuff on propaganda persuasion aesthetics/politics etc down to stuff like wittgenstein and kierkegaard if you want to get uber philosophical/technical what level you operating at    tell me what it is you want to market nationalism lipstick fruit
gospel of john based and logospilled
  thats a nice library ive only read zero to one from there where would you start now ive seen thinking fast and slow recommended everywhere
  tell me how you would market the idea that people like you shouldnt be executed postrevolution
  im pretty interested in the philosophy of advertising absolutely love wittgenstein  mostly im interested in marketing tech startups the new rules of marketing and pr is on my list and also political campaigning i cant figure out what the liberals are even trying to do either they have no coherent plan or they are playing 4d chess and i cant figure out which  ive read about ten books on that shelf mostly the more basic ones carnegie holiday cialdini bernays thiel thinking fast and slow and the intelligent investor  so far my favorite selling books are rules for radicals and jordan belforts most recent book  as for what ive picked up from them i can recognize the difference between logic and emotion and i can generally avoid complex discussions derailing into arguments i dont work in sales so thats the best estimate i can give at what i already know
  what is the single book you would recommend to most accurately familiarize someone with trumpism
  im going to be lazy and agree with  but also on truth and lies in a nonmoral sense and certain passages from the antichrist were an incredible initiation into a consciousness i had only briefly glimpsed as a child and abandoned when i became better socialized
  im the mayor of a small and suburban but religiously conservative community and i want to popularize cuckolding as a lifestyle in our community what book would you recommend for that
    dont worry revolution or not im set to benefit
this is a bad thread and you should feel bad for encouraging it

can there ever be a book that shits on nerd culture and has mainstream appeal
  can there be a book thats antimainstream but also mainstream
i think pop science is alright better than new age shit or christianity
  is nerd culture really mainstream though
  since 07 yes
  yes
  rapist
  too early desu id place the turning point around 2012
  geek culture  real nerds are still a rare breed of autist who is capable of advanced mental computation because they really enjoy learning math and science they are few and far between geeks however are mostly preoccupied with collecting funkopops and playing only the most trite of video games
  pop science is new age christianity aka heresy

  read iliad odyssey and the bible before you read anything else
the plays of shakespeare and the authorised version/king james bible are the foundation of the english language canon if the bible seems a bit daunting try the psalms to get a feel for the power of the poetry and languagebeautiful stuff

  claw of the conciliator  why would you want to read something else right now 
now i have to read this shit again
  can someone explain what is so great about this book i was tricked into reading the whole series and while gene wolfe is clearly a very intelligent author whose worlds are extremely fleshed out it seems like all that was really present were a lot of mythological references which are interesting to look out for but not used to saying anything meaningful or substantial
  particularly stuff you can find in a regular old bookstore  i assume you like fantasy so the obvious anything written by jrr tolkien cs lewis philip pullman christopher paolini and neil gaiman

i work so much these days that i just listen to audio books and discovered crime and punishment its pretty damn good it feels like a russian holden culfeild almost except he murders that old bitch that keeps asking for his rent what are some other books i can get into
  maga mindet by mike cernovich
  why  how does this have to do with trump  i literally just stumbled on this book when i got a free audiobook app
he doesnt kill his landlady he kills the pawnbroker and her sister
holden was a bit less of an asshole
  what did you expect  he is listening to an audiobook
superior version incoming
  wrong oxford version is superior

  faggots like you disgust me

does /lit/ write up reviews or thoughts about a book theyve just finished i feel like i finish one and move on to the next one too fast
is one flew over the cuckoos nest considered literature
opposed to what
  i use the word literature to denote a work of merit thats what i usually means would you say this book would be worth the read i dont see it talked about that much here or on charts thanks
  it usually means
  a work of merit    heres a gold star champ dont jerk yourself off too much
  in that case yes im reading it now what youre in for is an examination of mental health psychedelia and a cast of very memorable and simultaneously realistic characters
  it might sound pretentious or elitist but i really just like knowing what type of book im going to be reading id rather not waste my time on a book that isnt well reputed       good stuff im looking into the book because recent reads have been things like hunger to the lighthouse and the yellow wallpaper quite into introspective novels and ones that deal with the mind    also i havent seen the film that means i can watch it afterwards and see how it compares win win
  id rather not waste my time on a book that isnt well reputed  i kind of hope you get cancer
read sometimes a great notion instead then every time someone mentions one flew over the cuckoos nest tell them that sagn is far superior
  going off topic herei really would appreciate more mini reviews on cuckoos nestbut i dont see why thats a bad thing why would i put effort into a book and waste a few days on something that the majority of people think is bad consensus usually indicates that the work has flaws doesnt it what do people read reviews for do you also want people who read reviews to get cancer     anyway ill definitely pick up cuckoos nest
  poor consensus for example    damn why am i missing words all the time
what was the imperial russian version of a basedboy
  they definitely had cucks see war and peace and anna karenina
any books that will convince me to stop masturbating   we should make a chart for this
why would you ever stop masturbating orgasm is the most life affirming experience one can have youll have plenty time to nofap in your grave
  why would you ever stop masturbating  it precipitates negative effects eg tiredness loss of productivity distractability and reinforces a primal region of your brain muddying it with sexual thoughts and before long habituation ensues so youre doing this three times a day and it is harder to resist than it was even in the midst of puberty you become hypersexual and unproductive and before long accept it as just part of life  orgasm is the most life affirming experience one can have  if you think an ephemeral burst of pleasure is lifeaffirming thats very sad its also untrue as about half of all men experience postcoital dysphoria decline in activity is observed in animals too la petite mort the pleasure goes away as soon as the act ends it isnt satisfying you havent done or built anything   youll have plenty time to nofap in your grave  i dont believe in god i dont want to waste the one and only life i have on being a slave to my next orgasmic hit sexual excess whether through their own hands or through the body of another is the single most reason why most men are so mediocre in life
  dbt workbook anyway when you feel like masturbating recognize and acknowledge the thought while also reminding yourself out loud if need be that you dont want to masturbate even though you are having the impulse to and the impulse will pass you probably have a larger problem with impulse control and emotional regulation which chronic jacking can make worse certainly no better
  looking for a fellow germanbro whos willing to translate  bin gerade etwas gemütlich lol
  orgasm is the most life affirming experience one can have    literally the opposite is true orgasm is selfinduced oblivion
  just go to reddit
  none but i find parts of stoicism and particularly schopenenhauers view on the will to live and asceticism quite motivating in my pursuit of no masturbation marcus meditations is probably the quickest way to go but if you want more indepth content on virtue you should check out epictetus there is a decent amount of his content that isnt really directly related to abstaining from masturbation though just to let you know
  terrible advice people on reddit just want to replace the hand with a vagina even the language they use to refer to everything serves only to lead one to failure and to at best gain a temporary and pyrrhic victory they practice it physically but not mentally and as a consequence find themselves aroused all the time which is why the entire thing is mocked the term nofap itself is a negative connotation and that venue refers to the generative organs and things like sex using the most graphic language which serves only to reignite the neuronal pathways you are trying to weaken and overcome   you want successful abstinence ad block thumbnails here and do not visit any site that leads to failure or if you do be sure to block the element or thumbnail responsible for your failure i will ad block individual thumbnails on youtube just to prevent the if you want inspiration and just want something to motivate you find old writings on the material although medically crude in the proposed mechanisms i have found the book science discovers the physiological value of continence to be much better than going to nofap get yourself a copy nofap is a worthless cesspole that will make you view the act of abstinence as a source of frustration and difficulty if practiced in its entirely youll find it to be a source of freedom and neverending motivation    use filters    4chanorg/  4channelorg/
  what masturbating feels like if you have ocd
  just wait until you get so disgusted with yourself you stop naturally
  substitute a vice with another less harmful  everytime you feel the need you chew some gum go for a walk or anything else it wont work everytime but keep on for a few months until your habits change
  op here  just so you know my problem is that im surrounded by arousing women   both during class and even when i go practice swimming at the local gym
  though they might not be a large group there are surely people who see attractive women every day yet can abstain from masturbation in actuality your problem is either your outlook your will power or both build up your will power change your outlook or both and your problem is gone  or at the very least something you can continually defeat
  the problem isnt other people but a susceptibility to impulse which may come from certain architecture in your brain and you have to recognize it learn and practice skills or techniques in order to function more happily think of your mind and body as an instrumentare you just banging on the keys
  are you just banging on the keys  what does that mean 
  do things well make music not noise
  the perfect matrimony by samael aun weor
  that last sentence is insane
  read augustine     in this section his personal troubles including ambition continue at which point he compares a beggar whose drunkenness is temporal happiness with his hitherto failure at discovering happiness  augustine who separates from his previous wife finds a new mistress and deems himself to be a slave of lust  while reflecting in a garden augustine hears a childs voice chanting take up and read augustine picks up a bible and reads the passage it opens to romans 131314 not in revelry and drunkenness not in debauchery and wantonness not in strife and jealousy but put on the lord jesus christ and as for the flesh take no thought for its lusts this action confirms his conversion to catholicism
  i really enjoyed reading schopenhauer but i found that most of what he says regarding asceticism you can find in the bible
  you say that as if its a negative thing why
did caroline screw her brother maury in the sound and the fury i cant remember one hint of actual incest between them in the text but it makes way too much sense looking back benjy was originally named maury and is retarded/idiotic jason is obsessed with mony and has a stutter conceivably inbred and quentin while normal is obsessed with time and family honor and having some sort of incestuous relationship with his sister caddy their father is a drunk and caroline constantly complains that benjys retardation/quentins suicide is god punishing her help me /lit/ im freaking out
do i need to read all these footnotes man i need the audio book right now
  you are weak
  you can do it anon i believe in you 
  footnote 24  is that the filmography because you definitely need to read that
  it is and op definitely needs to read it its a closet biography of a major character a sort of moby dick whale catalogue update and also just a pile of jokes
hugh g rection
ij footnote 216
  is dfw actually that good like good enough to go down as part of western canon and be obligatory reading in 50 years   ive seen a lot of people disparage him but its not clear whether its his work or just his life/person they actually have an issue with
  i skipped footnote 24  do i need to reread the whole thing  nah  its just there to make it more immersive
  reading aloud takes longer than reading in the head
audible pdf of ij notes and errata 
  everyone here has an issue with him because not enough years have passed for him to be considered a classic by the literary circles
  do you think he will  ive read very little contemporary lit and aside from pynchon i wonder who will be remembered from our time  though probably no one can really know which is why i dont read much contemporary not that i doubt theres good work but its harder to find the true gems
  his prose is dreadfully bad and shit he writes is the epitome of pretentious collegekid attempt at deep without having anything of value to add
  this there are some fun parts in the book but his prose is awful and every single character is the same cookie cutter pretentious autist with the same backstory with mild differences
  dont give up 1 anon 2 upon discovering dfw 3 while i was at university 4 i wanted to impress people and started reading infinite jest around the campus5 many women would walk past and slow to see the title of this magnificent work obviously understanding its great importance6 and my lofty intelligence7 i would take it into lectures before they began and continue reading as others entered and took their seats8 only putting it down when the lecturer began9 then real study for upcoming exams got in the way and i started skipping footnotes10 soon i was becoming confused afraid id get called out 11 by passersby12 prior to completion i had to return it to the library13 never did i complete it and left university after that semester14 ive had regrets 15 about my failure to finish infinite jest ever since     1 continue reading infinite jest  2 anonymous user of 4channel imageboard /lit/  literature  3 infinite jest author david foster wallace  4 considered among the top 100 universities in the world infinite jest was on the third floor of the library i remember seeing the book and thinking it was so large it probably hadnt been touched in years  i took note of the title which naturally i found humorous upon searching it online i discovered that infinite jest is considered a modern american classic naturally i borrowed it out and began reading it that evening  813/54 20  1079 pages  in fact the return stamp indicated it had been borrowed earlier that year   published 1st february 1996  it was a chilly evening in early autumn   north americans refer to autumn as fall  south americans typically use the spanish word otoño which translates to autumn   5 it is a large campus and features many public spaces outdoor and indoor where one could be seen reading   6 by 2016 infinite jest had sold over 1 million copies and has been included in time magazines list of 100 best englishlanguage novels published between 1923 and 2005  7 iq of 115  8 students are often notoriously late   9 i was doing 4 papers that semester and had 4 corresponding lecturers   10 skipping footnotes essentially invalidates the work read all the footnotes   11 to be called out is modern parlance for a verbal confrontation as an intellectual and social coward this caused me concern and anxiety   12 as one of the worlds preeminent universities many of the students had read infinite jest it would be reasonable to consider it a milestone of campus life   13 beyond the original 2 week return id already extended twice and thus had no option but to return it only eligible to borrow it again after another 2 week return period   only current students and faculty staff were eligible to borrow books as it is a university library   14 incomplete bsc biology  15 a feeling of sadness repentance or disappointment over an occurrence or something that one has done or failed to do
  the only fiction book with footnotes you need to read is house of leaves prove me wrong
          footnotes
  i love these kinds of things can someone post screencaps of more posts like this
  i like him reminds me a lot of john williams if he were funny
dude stop fucking reading if you dont like it the filmography was a literal laundry list of jokes and should have been a goddamn riot to read through if it didnt motivate you to read more stop reading    not everyone has to like books
  not op but i simply dislike how every ij character has to be this hyperweird dysfunctional crazyperson plagued by a horde of personal demons it feels tryhard and bloated it reminds me of twin peakss log lady theres no rhyme or reason to her other than the fact that screenwriters thought having a lady with a log would be top zany every ij character is like that a log lady
  amazing
  is the audible audiobook a viable option how are the footnotes incorporated
  i want this to have happened
  the footnotes are not included in the audiobook version when one comes up in the text a voice different to the narrator says the number and youre supposed to pause the audio to consult and read the footnote yourself which you can see here     in my opinion it is a book that is definitely meant to be read rather than listened too im not sure i would be able to get through the audioversion because when i read it i was always flicking back and forth rereading sections etc but i have listened to the audiobook since reading the book and i enjoyed it
  this is such a good post
  dear anon    thank you for this enlightening answer  i will follow your wise example    sincerely    anon
i just finished this last night whats the general takeaway around here im too late to get here to know what the old threads had goin on
  infinite jest is a meme
  nice work anon
  is it a good meme though
  can someone post screencaps of more posts like this  that post1 is fresh2 pasta3 however it requires editing4 to be truly befitting of dfw5     1 the 15th reply of the thread  a thread is a series of posts on 4channelorg and similar forums  2 in this context fresh refers to an original post  3 pasta refers to the 4chan tradition of reposting original posts considered worthy of being shared again  in order to be considered worthy of being saved for future reposts an original post must be deemed humorous and/or informative to its intended audience   4 correction of grammatical errors  5 david foster wallace an influential american writer and university instructor in the disciplines of english and creative writing  david ulin of the los angeles times called wallace one of the most influential and innovative writers of the last twenty years      offering1 a compliment2 in an infinite jest3 thread4 without including footnotes5    1 the action of giving  2 kind words intended to convey appreciation  3 a novel widely noted in literary circles for its unconventional narrative structure and its experimental use of footnotes  4 a thread is a series of posts on 4channelorg and similar forums  5 an additional piece of information printed at the bottom of a page a technique extensively used by dfw in his magnum opus infinite jest
tfw finally understand the book as the gnostic metaphor it truly is     infinite jest aka the universal joke a deeply thelemic idea rooted in the title dfw like most other fiction writers seems to delve into occult philosophies to add depth to his creations   hal is rooted in a purgatorial state where he consumes massive amounts of media everrecurring adding no real value to his experience until he takes the drug an enlightenment or a sip from the lethe i cant tell at this point i need to keep thinking on it
  the magnum opus which turns shit tons of media consuming into something genuine and beautiful
  determining wether a meme is good or bad is the subjective imperative of the consumer to the meme   did you enjoy infinite jest
  i havent read it dont read contemporary lit thats why im asking ill read it someday but i might bump it up or down my to read list depending on what other people tell me about it
  hes extremely good but hes not for everyone the people who dont like him think hes just a meme but they just arent his audience
why does it need footnotes
  its really fucking good imho the first 300400 pages are pretty wild and wont make much sense but things start coming together after that and its truly phenomenal
i would read this book if pic related was the real cover
  my rule of thumb is if a book doesnt hook me after 55 pages the author can take a big chunky gulp out of my big funky junk
  hes extremely good  post a single paragraph of ij that you consider to be extremely good
  its complete shite if it sucks till fiddyfive  50 to build a world 5 to make me go awww if the author needs mo he can pick a straw cuz he sucks balls  if the exposition needs more than 55 pages the whole read will take ages fuck that shit im done with it
  a book that catches me at page 56 can suck a bag of dicks  the first 55 pages of your book is just an ad for the rest then not reading the rest would be best
  id say this guy is being generous with 55 pages i usually lose my patience with bad prose and meandering narrative by page 10 lifes too short to waste it on something that dares to bore me for even one bit
  everyone here has an issue with him  when did /lit/ as a whole stop loving dfw some still do but i saw a poll from 2013 and he was voted /lit/s favourite author ever on that one
which one is your favorite joi movie lads  mine is cage 3
  chart here actually early 2014 and infinite jest was voted the top not dfw himself  though there may be another one that matches what i said first   whatever the state of /lit/ now is im pretty sure no longer thing infinite jest is the best book is a change for the better
  spends the following 45 minutes picking his nose and scratching his nuts
    qts dont like the footnotes
    infinite jest is to /lit/ as itaots is to /mu/ and nge is to /a/ people constantly shit on them and theyre huge memes but theyre still overall liked by the board their creators are also all unique and extremely memeable personalities which is made even more important by the fact that all three of the works are very personal they all have their own quirks that lend themselves well to memes mangums voice the endnotes and the abstract bits of nge and so do their creators wanting to fuck anne frank being severely autistic and hating otaku being severely autistic and desperately wanting to seem smart also the bandana and the interview they are all very polarising with tons of people who love and hate them and are all 2deep4u they are all 90s but this is not a requirement they are still definitely all worth reading/listening to/watching even if only to see where your stance is  if i had to pick one work thats closest to being /lit/s meme work it would be ij but id actually say the entire meme trilogy is a better fit because as well as what i just said joyce and pynchon are also very memeable farts and reclusiveness and so are ulysses and gravitys rainbow specifically all the references the stink of shit floods his nose etc they are also definitely 2deep4u
  infinite jest is to /lit/ as itaots is to /mu/ and nge is to /a/  thanks the itaots comparison makes a lot of sense in particular
  people like to make fun of him but hes good maybe the best of that past 25 years
  memeable personalities  this is the most accurate word
  snap
  though you know the ij of music is not itaots but rather something slightly below stockhausens licht but not too far below
we need more infinite jest memes they are hilarious
anyone read this
  yes its not bad it is more of the same wed expect from dfw however i feel its more depressing since it deals with irs agents also you know he did kill himself while working on this book
  then he had a seizure the floor of the subway car became the ceiling of the subway car and he was on his arched  back in a waterfall of light gagging on old spice and watching his tumid limbs tearass around the cars interior like undone  balloons the booming zuckung zuckung zuckung was his high heels heels drumming on the soiled floors tile he heard a  rushing trainroar that was no train on earth and felt a vascular roaring rushing that until the pain hit seemed like the gathering of a  kind of orgasm of the head his head inflated hugely and creaked as it stretched inflating then the pain seizures hurt is what  few civilians have occasion to know was the sharp end of a hammer there was a squeak and rush of release inside his skull and  something shot from him into the air he saw bobby c cs blood misting upward in the hot wind of the copley blower his  father knelt beside him on the ceiling in a wellrended sleeveless tee extolling the red sox of rice and lynn tony wore  summer taffeta his body flopped around without ok from hq he didnt feel one bit like a puppet he thought of gaffed fish  the gown had a thousand flounces and a saucy bodice of lace crochet then he saw his father greengowned and rubbergloved  leaning to read the headlines off the skin of a fish a newspaper had wrapped that had never happened the largestprint headline  said push poor tony flopped and gasped and pushed down inside and the utter red of the blood that feeds sight bloomed behind  his fluttering lids time wasnt passing so much as kneeling beside him in a torn teeshirt disclosing the rodentnosed tits of a man  who disdains the care of his oncecomely bod poor tony convulsed and drummed and gasped and fluttered a fountain of light all  around him he felt a piece of nourishing and possibly even intoxicating meat in the back of his throat but elected not to swallow  it but swallowed it anyway and was immediately sorry he did and when his fathers bloodyrubbered fingers folded his teeth back  to retrieve the tongue hed swallowed he refused absolutely to bite down ungratefully on the hand that was taking his food then  without authorization he pushed and bit down and took the gloved fingers clean off so there was rubberwrapped meat in his  mouth again and his fathers head exploded into needled antennae of color like an exploding star between his gowns raised green  arms and a call for zuckung while tonys heels drummed and struggled against the widening stirrups of light they were hoisted  into while a curtain of red was drawn wetly up over the floor he stared down at tony and he heard someone yelling for someone  to give in err with a hand on his lace belly as he bore down to push and he saw the legs in the stirrups they held would keep  spreading until they cracked him open and all the way insideout on the ceiling and his last worry was that redhanded poppa  could see up his dress what was hidden
  great choice anon this passage stuck with me too when he swallows his tongue and then bites the guys fingers off eeek
      any dfw haters want to comment
what ever could have been meant by a picture such as this
what a great contribution to a literature board thank you
third person narrative
third person narrative  author isnt faulkner or conrad
    who are you quoting
  me
  based
first person narrative is anything more than being unable to process things from a perspective outside of yours and reveling in the artisticallytemperamented souls narcissism  he isnt better than i  current year  believing in the self
post some books about the future or at least books with interesting ideas
when the fuck does johnny shut the fuck up and why does he have to use such a fucking gay font
  because the author is gay
  gotteem
  youre reading it wrong its meant to be read backwards start with the whalestoe letters and work your way back towards the introduction
  no thanks nigger
  i stopped reading his sections about halfway through and enjoyed the book a lot more totally unnecessary cutesy pomo bullshit the core book is fantastic though the rest seems like a marketing gimmick
  i didnt do this but its a great idea
  thinking about doing the same right now ive just been skimming his sections and it just seems like pointlessly edgy woeisme drugfueled prose
im interested in books that relate to the topic of suicide specifically examples of accounts/notes before the suicide are there any books that collect notes or present an entire account of a persons reasoning for it
  i want to know too since im going to kill myself and i want to write the best suicide note ever
  maybe this one
  edouard leves book titled suicide  he even killed himself sortly after it was submitted to get published
  por mano propia estudio sobre las practicas suicidas   el hombre ante la muerte  phillipe ariés  cerrar la puerta  selección de poetas suicidas  michaelstadter  filosofía de la redención  poesía de josé asunción silva  creo que el primer libro de houellebeq
what are some cozy winter reads
  the works of pentti linkola
tolstoy
why doesnt /lit/ like him
why did he write that child gang bang scene in it
because hes popular
as a moralist board we cant abide his drug habits
cant imagine why this board hates him for writing cheap consumerist bestseller trash yet gives grrm a free pass for doing the same thing because dude sex and dragons haha
  youre right theyre both based
  looks like a freak
he writes like a smelly old uncle who always greets you with a howtha hell are ya
  he was good growing up no one should be as nostalgic to reread his stuff once theyve in their twenties
idk pet semetary is pretty comfy hes good at what he does but what he does isnt particularly interesting
he is pretty consistently alright  not remarkable not bad just alright
  his early cokehead stuff is good not high art literature or anything but entertaining there was a big drop in quality once he got clean though
  this    one of the reasons /lit/ is by far the worst art board on the site
    wrong he writes pulp fiction the literary equivalent of blockbuster films read salems lot it may be very entertaining but its in no way artistic or original i read all his books in middle school and i enjoyed them but an author whos main demographic is teenagers is in no way comparable to say dostoevsky
the stand got me into reading and helped to give attention span for long books even though its an easy read so i can thank him for that
dgbdgbeonpfhf
vcmfuydzjhi
  who told you to compare it to dostoevsky thats what pseuds do to feel intelligent while king himself calls his books hamburger and fries of literature
because this is a board for pseuds their niche lit interests define them as people and therefore enjoying a king novel would put them among the masses whom they despise but secretly wish to impress    so instead they read a bunch of stuff that deep down they utterly fucking hate most of them would get far more enjoyment out of an author like king than reading whatever protofascist author /lit/ recommended to them    just look at your average stack thread investments of pure misery unopened and unread pathetic
  i like him ops mistake is in imagining that /lit/ is one person
  wrong he writes pulp fiction the literary equivalent of blockbuster films    youve never read any of the actual pulps have you go read some edward elmer smith or early hubbard    and then the nazi plane came around the corner of the jungle and attacked the giant alligator
/lit/ only reads classics from over 50 years ago and a touch of science fiction and fantasy there is almost no discussion about non literary contemporary fiction king is not the exception
  doubt it otherwise /lit/ would hate shakespeare borges dostoyevsky tolstoy etc authors who are also popular
  false we read bolaño cortazar garcia marquez dfw etc
  thats true there are a couple of exceptions also 100 years of solitude is over 50 years old now and not many people here have read even cholera let alone his other stuff
has anyone here read apt pupil would you recommend it
  not dosto specifically just an example on a board where the classics are discussed along with writers like dosto king falls horribly short in terms of depth    and then the nazi plane came around the corner of the jungle and attacked the giant alligator  much of king is barely a notch above this anon yes some books are pretty creative but the one i mentioned salems lot or carrie absolute middleschooltier not remarkable literature by any means or maybe you have a 6th grade reading level not judging but if so king should be right up your alley
  he writes for children
  tfw i greet my uncle like this every time i see him
because we are pretentious and use our literary taste to draw a distinction from the common body of persons
  pathetic  whats worse pathetic people or people complaining about pathetic people people dont discuss king because theres not much to discuss   why did the protagonist let the demon cat into his home couldnt he tell he was a demon  why did the bullies dump pig blood on the girl isnt that a little grotesque  stephen king is popcorn literature read eyes of the dragon and report back
im a big horror fan mostly movies but im focusing on lit now and so i saw the shining movie and then i read the book lets just say that i wanted to kill myself after reading the first 3 lines
  name a better art board
  hes a doctrinaire liberal cuck and of course this  
  
  it wasnt a gangbang scene idiot she had sex with them one at a time    how can you be this stupid
  but theyre dead and popular therefore they are classics /v/ in 50 years will love stephen king
we ate him because he said mean things about the president
  lol
  this guy knows child sex scenes well   
form equals function
  
  already posted a brother thread there im curious of the philosophical arguments for or against this
function is emergent from form combinatorics
whats the function of life
  to make lifeforms
  its current year  not being a nominalist    imagine in 2018 believing in a nonnominalist ontology fml    pic unrelated
  not being an animist    hoo boy
  whats the function of lifeforms
    still labeling non sunstantial beliefs  hoo boy
  to continue living breeding is just a malfunction
  ouch you got me there
    wrong their function is to breed thats why lifeforms as simple as cells reproduce or that some ants sacrifice themselves for the greater good of the colony
  this is not science you nigger
  to live life
feels are reals
  wrong most lifeforms are essentially evolved with planned obsolescence in their dna it aids in speeding up the evolutionary process by killing off members and giving them an imperitive to pass on their genes it also keeps the population steady there are some lifeforms that can live forever it can work we just are made to die
  what about constituative parts reducing up to effect or down to elements is still reduction although either can operate as definition depending on context
  they dont self sacrifice they are sacrificed by others that deem them unnecessary eg the oldest wildebeest being pushed to a gator so the herd can cross cuz he wont reproduce and will die soon anyway  its a cruel world out there young blood
  there are no determinate forms
  we made a circle
im pretty sure this already exists but fuck it  i thought it would be a good idea to make a thread about prose and structure in general    questions and statements to think about or parse  what is the problem with genteelisms such as prior to instead of before  should you use a thesaurus  is it an issue if some commas and semicolons are unnecessary and only used to regulate the rythim of the text  how long should the descriptive parts go on for before moving back to the main parts  how many analogies is too many  how do you start a story at a reasonable rhythm  i know they are very dumb questions but i really need help with some of these  i usually dont make threads so pls no bully
bumping my own thread because im impatient
please answer my dumb questions at 322 in the morning
relax op i think you fit in here just fine these are all really good questions honestly    ill wager one    thesauruses should never be used to find a better word in a question of word choice it almost always leads to an unnatural break in voice i think its really good to use etymologies while reading though having a sense of the dual anglosaxon/latin nature of english gives you great insight into it and greater power over it
   is the problem with genteelisms such as prior to instead of before  they make you sound like a pretentious faggot also theyre slightly more effort to parse so an overabundance of them is annoying   you use a thesaurus  you can if you want i do when i know theres a word im looking for but i cant recall it i plug in a synonym and get the word or alternatively when im looking for a more exact word so for example i might want to convey that the character is doing something similar to leering but without the creepiness so i plug leer into a thesaurus and have a look at similar words with slightly different connotations to see if any of them are suitable   it an issue if some commas and semicolons are unnecessary and only used to regulate the rythim of the text  i wouldnt use them that way id just rewrite the actual text so that the rhythm is in the words and not the punctuation for example i originally wrote id just rewrite the text so that the rhythm is in the words not the punctuation then i changed it to id just rewrite the text so that the rhythm is in the words and not the punctuation using and gives a similar break as using a comma without creating confusion through incorrect punctuation   long should the descriptive parts go on for before moving back to the main parts  there should be no nonmain parts if the description isnt a main part get rid of it you should only waste time describing things that actually matter   many analogies is too many  you should only ever need one analogy and you should definitely only ever use one more is just confusing   do you start a story at a reasonable rhythm  i have no fucking clue
  nb dont use words from thesauruses that you dont recognise
  what is the problem with genteelisms such as prior to instead of before  what  said with the caveat that certain narratorial voices make them work a lot better that others    should you use a thesaurus  only if you need to if you find youre overusing certain words then id recommend it but otherwise it seems like kind of a waste of time just read more in general and youll find yourself adding new words to your vocabulary    is it an issue if some commas and semicolons are unnecessary and only used to regulate the rhythm of the text  i dont think so but i have a bad habit of just writing stream of consciousness bullshit and overusing commas i think they can become a problem if youre overdoing it but if youre using them in conjunction with line breaks and full stops and all that other good shit then its fine    how long should the descriptive parts go on for before moving back to the main parts  they should be basically identical understand description as something you do to fill in the gaps in the story not a separate thing in and of itself if theres a scene where a female character is meant to be attractive then youd use description to draw attention to that its just an easy way of doing subtext    how many analogies is too many  stick to one per object or if you have to have more make sure theyre linked somehow that way its a motif and not just repetition     how do you start a story at a reasonable rhythm  depends on the story if its going to have a reveal then you want to build up to it otherwise i find it useful to start by situating a character in a situation relating to their conflict and seeing where it goes from there eg if a character is having money problems then start with them trying to buy groceries and being hyperaware of how much theyre spending shit like that basically just get to the point and then once youre there you can start being clever
one more bump
how can a fairy  human relationships works out in fantasy literature    they are going to have sexual need and lust no matter how pure their romance and relationship can be  the more and deep they love each other the stronger the feelings would get  how could the fairy girls/woman satisfy her lover and herself   not to mention the wanting to have kids together to have family part
ive read books like lolita crime and punishment death of ivan ilyich hunger to the lighthouse will i be able to understand pale fire itd be my second nabokov is there something else i should read before pale fire instead thank you
  heres the /lit/ nabokov guide  still pale fire isnt so difficult that youre not gonna be able to read it its a harder read than anything listed there but as long as you pay attention youre not gonna get lost or frustrated as you might with something like ulysses or gravitys rainbow
  oh neat nabokov released a new novel
how difficult is lolita
  it would seem shes pretty easy
  no you will not be able to understand pale fire
  how is this list assembled by difficulty
for me its zembla
  cells
its still a mystery to me why do people take nabokovs writing serously maybe he was a smart teacher but his similies are sophomore tier
  pale fire  is this really that hard
  based
  its very dense filled with anagrams and puns that only make sense in other languages its crazy shit
  ada is easily the hardest text nabokov ever wrote
  good meme my friend      if you have a firm grasp on english its not too hard i havent really read anything beyond web articles in years and im reading lolita and 1984 to get back into actual books both are working well

every single person who has responded to this thread is lying
  posts like the one pictured always bug me people act like they need to throw out all of their screwdrivers because they went from driving screws to stabbing people with them as if their lack of self control is actually the fault of the tool or that the tools utility is invalidated by its potential for uses outside of that utility
  current videogames are actually made to be addictive its hard to maintain say a gambling habit in a healthy way
  fag
  it hurts to look at her
  reading is as much a time waster as tv / anime etc prove me wrong
  current videogames  oh all of them every single one theres no way to enjoy video games in the year 2018 without getting stuck in a dopamine fed skinnerbox there are no video games that can be enjoyed without letting them control your life and inhibit your ability to enjoy other things or be productive or maybe just an idea there are actually a lot of games that are perfectly good and some people just have trouble with impulse control
  what exactly is the use of all those things ill grant you that indulging once in a while wont be as damaging as outright addiction but even then whats the point you watch tv play vidya jack off and shitpost so you can close your eyes and slumber you consent to be deceived in the name of entertainment thus establishing and confirming a daily routine and habit which in not beneficial to you and built on purely illusory foundations seeking to cut out all of this stuff is a noble goal
  at that rate you mustve read most of the canon in a single year how has it been any unknown masterpieces
  recreation is pointless and is to be discarded said the anonymous man browsing 4channelorg with seemingly no recognition of the irony   first of all the internet is useful for things other than occupying your brain until it turns off if you dont know how to use the internet productively you have a problem not the internet secondly i dont know what the fuck you mean by you consent to be deceived in the name of entertainment i know there arent actually tiny people inside of my television reenacting events for my pleasure
  i started reading late in life so im still working my way through the more popular classics like dickens and dostoevsky on top of that i mostly read nonfiction so its going to be a while before get into any obscure stuff im usually reading three books at a time with one of them being fiction
  games are either dopamine therefor potentially addictive or boring
  youre wrong because novels can contain ideas which are too subtle to convey in other mediums the novels greatest strength is being able to describe a characters thoughts directly done well it can help you avoid or emulate certain patterns of thought making you a better person overall    for example reading notes from the underground made me realize how deep my own ressentiment was i would not have had the same experience from watching a show about a terrible person
  pornography and masturbation and even sex are the biggest waste of time and drain on someones life and is why most people are low energy and so mediocre
  everything good you do releases dopamine therefor everything good you do is potentially addictive if you cant manage that like an adult its not the game thats the problem
  except i feel good after reading
  reading engages the mind frivolous entertainment atrophies it
  there are actually a lot of games that are perfectly good  yeah and people dont get addicted to those
  yeah and people dont get addicted to those  which is why im saying people shouldnt need to write off the entire medium
  this reading and drawing are the two things that never made me feel like the time was wasted

  ive cut myself off from the internet on a few occasions and it helped my focus tremendously but after a handful of weeks i start slipping back into using it more and more    but honest question what the hell are you going to do with yourself if you cut out entertainment completely if youre not reading watching browsing gaming or fapping what in the world are you doing for so many hours is this only relevant to wageslaves
  you consent to be deceived in the name of entertainment i know there arent actually tiny people inside of my television reenacting events for my pleasure  is this b8 thats not what it means
to start this off my phone sucks  ive broken/lost way too many phones so i said fuck it and got a cheap grandma smartphone which is indestructible  bad side it has no memory at all recently my citys tram ticket app needed an update and that brought me over the edge had to uninstall both spotify and podcast app  however i do own a kindle  so now i have no choice on my commute whenever i would listen to music or podcasts i just read  its kinda nice
  some random creep on the bus who knows
  train in stockholm
  why why must you torment me so with these jezebels all i want to do is come here for an asexual experience that will exercise my brain but i am constantly titillated by these vixens with their prodigious hips and provocative figures can i never satiate this thirst will i ever know the touch of a woman and enter between her loins will my seed ever drip from her moistened hole
  i think reading consuming films and music and even gaming can be active and enlightening experiences its just a problem if they become mindless like youre posting for hours getting nothing out of it and feeling shitty after
  based as usual
  thats not what it means  thats why i said i dont know what you mean directly beforehand
  fair enough you win
  i agree which is why i cut myself off from the internet periodically because i find im basically addicted to it and am doing nothing but browsing and getting no satisfaction and cutting yourself off from one or two forms of entertainment can make sense to get yourself to do other things but to quit all forms of entertainmentwhat is left going to knit walk around talk with friends for 16 hours a day its not really plausible
  its incredible how centuries after the mongol invasion the asiatic genes still show
  in what the genes of swedes
  are all girls in stockholm super qt
  t thinks his iron free will is responsible for his well being  you are a product of chemicals dont berate others that cant regulate their neurotransmitters well because of shitty childhood

  i have read lole 2 hours in the past month i legit think that of i had a gf i would read more because having a gf would help my depression
  perfectly good  nope get a girl who doesnt play games to stand next to you looking at you and the screen as equally inanimate objects able you explain why the game is perfectly good and worth five minutes of her time its not shes probably rather blow you than watch that get your head out of your ass
  able you explain  while you explain
  when i see images of jezebels like this i feel a sharp pain in my chest and my heart begins to beat with an unfortunately familiar rapidity my mind wanders against my will and these thoughts enter my soul these vile retched thoughts unwelcomed my soul profaned what am i to do despite my desire to rise above despite my desire for ascetic purity above all i am felled by mere ones and zeros my bone marrow stripped dry chest carved openheart wrenched suspended in the air there it float as if separate from my soul i can see it as if it were not of my being i see as it beats with ever increasing intensity the butchers knife draws near the fear the desperation the loneliness it is all palpable perspiring down the sodden flesh of my heart split in two then three then four and so on i am powerless to stop it bones dust ethereal body fading soul meandering the remains are made into a delectable stew it smells of rot and pain and suffering but i eat it enjoy it even my body is rejuvenated heart shrunk soul blackened and profaned is there no escape from this cycle of ever increasing debasement is there no escape from these jezebels why lord why
  knitting s fun plus you wind up with shittons of clothes and blankets  what youre describing as a ludicrous way to spend the day is pretty normie theres lots of fun stuff you can do all day that isnt vidya or bingewatching reruns or pointless internets anon you dont need those to put any dent in your 16 hours you wont die of boredom without another 100 f5s

  whats so hot about the way she sits
  i like white train cat more than white train gorl tbqh
about three fiddy
  it make her look that she had wide hips which is a sign for good childbirth so she is now a young fertile wife is more able to get healthy white heterosexual sons  submissive eyes she is using a cellphone and exibit her hair indicating that she is disponible to sexual encours
  i play vidya to keep my reaction time sharp and prevent myself from going insane thank you very much
  well technically everything is a time waster

  thats what i wanted to hear makes me feel better about my runescape addiction
    women dont understand how male lust actually operates women think that men experience women as the beautiful as something pleasant and trifling that can be enjoyed at a distance and then allowed to pass on they think that a picture of themselves wearing clothing that shows off all their fat and all their soft skin and warm nice holes is like a postcard with a picture of a beach on it but to men female beauty is not the beautiful its the sublime its not trifling but great and terrible and it stirs something great and terrible and daemonic in mans subterranean depths that impels him forward to fuck things from roughly below and behind the prostate area    when a man sees a picture of a beautiful sexy woman he feels half a million years of race knowledge thrumming in his veins an infinity of sexy women reaching around behind themselves to spread their asscheeks and pussy apart with one hand and say fuck me he hears the drums from the movie jumanji his soul tangibly but invisibly leans forward outside of him grasping desperately for the pussy and gnashing its teeth he wants to taste her holes and squeeze her fat and smell that combination of smells girls have that when you ask them what it is they say its just normal shampoo and fabric softener but you know its something more
  this is the gayest description of heterosexual lust i have ever seen
  oh my god please lose some weight go outside and have sex please
  so this is what incels really think of women
  budget oscar wilde here
  porn is a sociopsychological weapon
  male lust for the cute and otherworldly the beautiful hierarchical and sublime and for the animalistic and fertile fetishes seem to combine these in fashion variety   i know the two latter apply for women as well do they have anything in place of the cute
  based and disciplined
  this is horrifying considering how shit of a game rs3 is
  i read the precise amount of stop posting jezebels reeeeeeee hours every day
  what canon
  kek spot on
  1 hour before bed
  sometimes nothing at all sometimes nothing at all for weeks unless shitposting counts  sometimes 15 hours a day sometimes 15 hours a day for weeks  it depends on how much free time i have for reading
  think about it guys this girl poops she does big poopies that hurt and she has to hold her breath and grit her teeth and then when the poopie passes she has to let out a heavy moany breath of air     poopies come out of her butt    temp blocked for posting garbage outside of /b/ when im not the one posting jezebels on lit in the first place  fuck jannies
  mfw the new regime is destroying 4chans site culture established over years of lax rules  mfw soon this site will be empty
  pleass delet
  whats a 4chan
  ive shown you my potions answer me
  fuck you
  go learn a language or something  have you ever tried it because the best strategy to reach foreign language fluency bar none is constant consumption of garbage entertainment
   soon this site will be empty  good
school work included 10 hours probably  just books its about 2 hours
  this is incredible anon
  im reading notes from the underground right now i like it so far
  more like how many minutes
  ubisoft clone  good
  yeah but its easier to put a book down than either
  big if true
  but its exactly that the fault lies with them and their lack of self control most people just dont have the fortitude to ignore these things out of their life easily bear in mind these are addictions that have adversely affected their lives which is why theyre desperate for a way out its not some minute habit better to just get rid of whatever it is completely than have it there easily accessible only to tempt you
  the literary canon
  work on your b8 lad 2/10
depends on the day what i am reading and other factors   i usually spend about 1 hour or so reading nonficition 30 minutes reading fiction 15 hours reading the scripture     i mostly spend most of my time job hunting and going to interviews
  i dont know but when i do its 4chan comments
  comments   back to 4channel
  enough of this fucking pasta
  im sure the thing is i dont see 4chan in your schedule and one does not come here irregularly
                you are not a passive container in which phenomena dump themselves reading in general has no more or no less value than anything else
  literature tends to have more meaning if you read good shit youre learning and being active you dont have to be passive while doing other things but theres generally not as much depth nothing really to absorb aside from entertainment which reading also provides
  pretty accurate
  nah reading makes you better than illiterates just like working out makes you better than lazy faggots
it depends on the complexity of what im reading and if i enjoy it

  if imageboards count all day everyday
can someone help me analyze/decode the meaning of this text the last thread pointed to the film the matrix and while i think thats a strong example im actually most curious about the pranksters and the significance of the name reinhardt and what strange ivy league ritual theyre referring to with the blindfolding thing ive heard the skull and bones society did similar things thanks    its great clock hangs over him and empty acres of streets in what he now reads as dumb malignity it connects to ivy league quadrangles in his distant youth clocktowers lit so dim the hour could never be read and a temptation never so strong though as now to surrender to the darkening year to embrace what he can of real terror to the hour without a name unless its    no    no    it was vanity vanity as his puritan forerunners had known it bones and heart alert to nothing nothing underneath the college saxophones melding sweetly white blazers lipsticked about the lapels smoke from nervous fatimas castile soap vaporizing off of shining hair and mint kisses and dewed carnations it was being come for just before dawn by pranksters younger than he dragged from bed blindfolded hey reinhardt led out into the autumnal cold shadows and leaves underfoot and the moment then of doubt the real possibility that they are something elsethat none of it was real before this moment only elaborate theatre to fool you but now the screen has gone dark and there is absolutely no more time left the agents are here for you at last  gravitys rainbow
if i had to guess most of what we assume about elite societal rituals are really more like performatory traditions and injokes that serve to indoctrinate new members to the ideals of the club by brainwashing them with unfamiliar yet controlled experiences and developing some kind of perceived dependence
reinhardt as a name in this metaphor means brave and strong or something implying the identity were assuming is supposedly worthy of the task and thus why youre being tested basically pynchon was probably a member of some elite fraternity much like many expresidents and the likes of which probably no longer exist and hes playing with that idea here with slothrop has realized that although he has escaped the contrpointsmens henchmen it becomes increasingly clear that he cannot ever be sure hes escaped the control of them
      these were all me bumping my own thread  can we get some alternative perspectives please
bump
norm macdonald is a genius did you know he reads russian literature
i hope we can meme this into reality    i fuckin love norm
  its already reality
  good
he actually is though
  yes thats why i made this thread
this is satisfying for me  i wish everyone just said how jp helped them and it will become the new religion of earth as a whole
has norm macdonald ever been funny
  no    
    im oh so horny for your boi puccis
imagine having the name norm
  norm and jp and fame whores   actual luminaries dont use cameras to get their ideas out in the world
oh boy oh boy its this thread again lmao
  yes i do     one of the best bits from nml  
recently found out im dyslexic     any one else here dyslexic are you able to take advantage of it in any way     how can i benefit off this  i see the big picture of things clearly but to extrapolate into definitions of theories and to connect things piece by piece is seemingly impossible
the only pro ive found is being able misspell words to create passwords
  dyslexia isnt real
  do you have good social skills to make up for it
fihgt me puyss
how is dyslexia still a problem with spell check software being implemented everywhere
i got diagnosed with it during uni got me an extension on my dissertation so thats a definite benefit
  yeah really good   i dont feel like im making up for anything desu
  dyslexia isnt about spelling somethings are just backwards
not a fan of that book but im glad that mine doesnt look that bad
one of my favorite covers ive ever seen not only is it pretty it describes the book well
  adelphibompianieinaudifeltrinelli
  di solito la feltrinelli fa delle belle copertine questa la trovo orribile
started out being really pissed off with all the seemingly vacuous epigrams but eventually really enjoyed it what do you think /lit/
  for me its lord henry wotton  intelligent nihilistic and with a wicked sense of humour
the first twenty or so pages were a bit of snooze three men in an art studio two of them complimenting the appreance of the other isnt too enjoyable sorry but eventually it just kinda clicked lord henrys lines were enjoyable dorian was sympathetic and the whole bit with sybil was perfectly tragic not to mention the writing style i really started to enjoy it
  why exactly is there a portrait of a young franz liszt on the cover
  spoiler
  its been a while since ive read the novel but i am fairly certain that neither franz liszt nor his music makes an appearance
  he didnt find the secret chapter
  another reason why wordsworth is the truly intellectual publisher
  i can forgive wilde being a fag but i will not forgive him for being a mick
  same reason des esseintes is actually frantisek kupka plebple dont recognize noteworthy figures they just see a brooding painting that may as well be the protagonist
  its the best novel ever written wildes style is unparalleled
  wildesstyle    holy shit the lego movie is secretly based
  i didnt know what to make of it its definitely a decadent book but its also a moralizing one to me that seems an odd combination
  the book is too honest about the cost of a decadent lifestyle and where it can lead for me to see it as decadent itself
  i like the lord guy he reminds me of myself
post popular motifs that are nonetheless awesome    our world pales in comparison to a forgotten glorious past
in 20 years when there is a multimillion stockpile of women in their 30s and 40s who spent their teens and 20s whoring around who have no children and are a bunch of depressed wine aunts what kind of literature will we see will we see millions of books attacking men gaslighting them for actions the women made themselves
why are you like this
    never start a thread again hide in shame for the next decade you subhuman filth lord
  i pity you anon
      id thought all of /lit/ had turned into op but apparently not good to know
  what if im the male version of this
  battybwoy
damn 4cuck really has taken a nose dive since i left    stay strong op
i frown upon these whores as anyone else but the idea that all of them will hit this supposed wall and be left alone sad and childless is just wishful thinking perhaps you think that there will be some kind of cosmic justice in this life but it wont be like that us ugly men have a cross to bear throughout our lifes and seeing others suffer wont lessen this test
  bumba clot to get bun to have ones spouse or girl/boyfriend cheat on oneself to be cheated out of something 6
  op cant stay strong hes already chosen to be weak
  are you caribbean or do you just like their language
these kinds of threads need to stop please

whats with the black lipstick thing i dont mind women doing their thing but black lipstick is literally turning me asexual
  why i joined my local twitter archive reading club  despite a feminist youth i became a housewife living on a mans alms and now that he died perhaps i can fulfill that little long lost wild vulnerable glistening furtive girls dreams   ive been menopausal for longer than i havent been menopausal and why thats a good thing  looking back at my periods makes me feel like a holocaust survivor looking back at their imprisonment and why i hate that men make me feel that way  why i stopped buying tampons from pedophobic companies   my third postnatal abortion was the best thing that happened to me
  lmao yeah it is pretty ugly      this        enjoy that slave morality faggots
  wait i thought sweetie posting was a chan thing
  thing is much as i want to agree with you my main fear is that i will be a single unemployed depressed uncle since im spending my 20s as an incel 4channer
  dont worry you will surely write that bestseller book and be rich like the harry potter lady
wtf are these replies
  which ones and what did you expect
  it is but it comes from peoples moms saying it on social media but i suppose its probably used by younger people to patronise each other too idk
  probably a mixture of people tired of /pol/posters on their sfw literature board and people tired of seeing threads that contribute nothing to the literature board    i know some anons will say its always been this way but literally four years ago this board was very slow moving to the extent that threads could last a few days just because if people had nothing to contribute they didnt come in with shitposts
how was he so good
who
gay  french  high iq  boring  sat home and wrote all day  need i go on
  marcel searching for lost time proust
  did he ever find it
well i havent read anything hes written as far as i know but wikipedia said he didnt like socialism so he couldnt have been that bad
  only college kids like socialism and none of them are good writers
  what difference does it make he wrote in french    and you havent read anything he wrote
why does this board have such a hard on for proust when there are a number of more important modernist writers worth talking about
  right the fuck on    ever notice how many people go to college to study english but anything/everything they write is borderline propaganda at best a full blown thirdwave intersectional genderstudies breakdown of historically oppressive racial systems and ethnic stereotypes at worst
  such as whomst if anything there is no proust discussion here everyones busy wanking off joyce or beckett
  you havent read him then   his saga as a whole isnt the best of the best but you cannot read it and just forget about it the ending of swanns way is probably the best piece of writing ever made
  modernist or post modernist because right now all i have to say if you mean postmodernist is you can fuck right off
how was he so good
  i went to college for stem shit and im a better writer than 9999 of most english majors i encountered theyre just positioning themselves to take over the next generation circle jerk of academia
  i have read him and it makes a big difference you may a retard who cant tell the difference but others here arent and expect you to not call kikes french
      
 albertine was like a stone around which it has snowed the generating center of a huge building that rose above the plane of my heart      the links between an individual and we exist only in our thoughts the memory grows fainter relaxes them and despite the illusion that we would be fools and where out of love friendship politeness respect duty we cheat others we exist alone man is the creature that can not emerge from himself who knows other than himself and saying the opposite lies     every reader as he reads is actually the reader of himself the writers work is only a kind of optical instrument he provides the reader so he can discern what he might never have seen in himself without this book the readers recognition in himself of what the book says is the proof of the books truth    honestly i need to read way more proust
  everyones busy wanking off joyce or beckett  joyce and beckett barely get talked about on here at least these days but i see proust fanboys jerking him off everyday    such as whomst   well besides the two already mentioned theres mann hesse pound eliot yeats hamsun pirandello  etc
  nobody cares what you think youre a foul human being and will never amount to something i hope i end up killing you in some kind of crisis one day
  heyhey so did i im an engineer and i can say that my time reading tech manuals and working on ships steam diesel electrical hydraulic fw and sw systems etc etc was massively helpful in increasing the number of ways i could think about problems and make connections between things     im a systems engineer so i am almost always looking at things and trying to see the way the work together and the number of systems they fit into     ive found that you can do the same with literature really      ok
  reported for violent speech and semite defending enjoy your ban schlomo
  never amount to something    anon what the fuck is wrong with you   never amount to anything  anything you fucking idiot
  joyce and beckett barely get talked about on here  i disagree a data analysis could decide the issue objectively but the joyce meme threads are near constant and nobody talks about proust    granted we could have just had different experiences     mann  the attitude here is completely dismissive of him and underappreciated so i guess i agree     hesse  ive seen a few posts about him but he doesnt get much attention either partly because this place sucks     pound eliot yeats hamsun pirandello  in my mind i dont view these as members of the same modernist class of writers pound and eliot maybe but theyre poets yeats verges on the symbolist i cant speak to the rest     faulkner gets talked about constantly
  faulkner gets talked about constantly  its virtually 100 me
  he was a french jew im happy that apparently makes you green with envy
  most of those things apply to me though
  there is no such thing as a french jew there are jews and various types of crypto jews in france but they arent french
  i dont think france would agree because then theyd be losing one of their best writers of all time by excluding him
  french isnt a race its a nationality there has been so much intraeuropean movement there that it would be stupid to pretend otherwise
  proust was not a good writer      that has nothing to do with what i said jews are semitic outsiders they do not get to attach a host label to themselves to make their crypsis more effective they need to be pointed out and pushed out
  it doesnt get much more pleb than this
  gay  french  nice try blackie
  regardez ce con
  hesse was pretty popular a few months ago but this place goes through phases with authors
  he only ever lost even more and in the end the people and places around him stretched out through that lost dimension and when he tried to grasp their idea they had become giants impossible to grasp
  he wrote an essay defending the cultural heritage of catholic cathedrals against the secular liberals who wanted to destroy them    proust was altright
    well he was baptized and confirmed catholic although didnt practice as an adult he admired catholic aesthetics but defended dreyfus while writing some mildly to moderately antisemitic descriptions of jewish characters in in search of lost time    theres not a whole lot that is really jewish about him in fact he was probably more embarrassed by his part jewishness than anything
  your understanding of crypto jews and jewish crypsis generally needs some honing a jew is a jew and never anything else until the genetic component gets below 1/4 and even then there are residual effects of jewery
  he was like 1/8 jew or something
  no he was halfkike
  you put a lot of thought into something that matters incredibly little in the machinery of the world good job
  matters incredibly little  a tiny group vastly over represented in power that conceals its identity and deceives hosts to increase its power matters a whole fucking lot bud back to weddit
  what if its not truly genetic but a state of mind
  are stormfags recruiting again or something
    this makes him a lousy writer    no effect on writing   iq  low iq small forehead and close eyes he had an iq of 105 at best    yes he was   home and wrote all day  which is why his works was garbage only undergrad literary major pseuds like proust simply because their professors like proust
  it is a tribal mentality that has been reinforced for so long culturally within their inbred ingroup that the associated behaviors are genetic
  being french has no effect on writing  get a load of this pédé
do you know the difference generally speaking between people who have seriously spent time studying and digesting the humanities the ideas the artworks the pieces of music the literature     other people are boring they have nothing interesting to say because they have no critical capacities of their own they repeat the same tiresome opinions that the media shovels into to them and then they simply shuffle around these reconstituted opinions between themselves equally badly all they can do is tell inane stories about the particularities of their lives their holidays abroad for example their weekends or stories about their families and all these stories amount to is a series of one event after the other of varying degrees of spectacularity garnished with some sort of pithy comment or moral by the teller because again the teller has no grasp of any particular depth on their emotions on events on things       am i saying i never talk about my weekend am i saying i never make small talk of course not am i saying that every conversation a person has must be some sort of heavy finegrained analysis of course not but this is what i am saying for many people what i just described is the absolute horizon of their capacity to talk about and appreciate things it is consumption and excretion there is no digestion no reflection     when i have a conversation with someone i truly want to have a conversation with there is the capacity for moving beyond those things that constitute every other tedious endsdriven conversation there is small talk but there is only small talk for the first little while of the conversation before we get down to talking about things that are of any significance or there is the capacity to reflect on something innocuous something little in a way that all the others would simply gloss over in the effort to get on to the next appropriately fascinating thing done or response given    people who have never been seriously exposed to critical thinking via the humanities and arts are boring assholes generally speaking and in a seminonjudgemental sense some of you know what im talking because youve spent time applying the thinking and appreciation learned in philosophy or through literature or cultural texts to your own lives and you realize that youre not just stockpiling cultural information for the sake of impressing someone or for personal enjoyment but youre actually using it to make you a better welldeveloped and more interesting person
what is the pagan conception of evil
weakness ergo subversion
evil is a social construct in the mind of slaves
are you referring to proper platonist pagans from the time of constantine    or do you mean edgy atheist humanist faggots who hail satan because it rustles the normies
  the former
  i think they would have considered a personal imbalance especially a preference for and attachment to sensual worldly things as evil ergo cowardice would be evil whether it be martial or spiritual a lack of virtus would be evil falsehood with others impiety towards the gods a weakness of personal will and all the attendant deficiencies that come with it basically the same things we associate with villains today    captain america would have made a great pagan
read aristotles ethics esp about the golden mean
  interesting thank you      no
dishonor is the closest thing to evil there is as far as im aware
dishonor lack of reverence lack of awareness greed cowardliness all these things going to lead to actions which give rise to evil    the eastern religions would call them actions which are not in accord with dharma or the tao
virgins btfo
they call it the golden rule for a reason it doesnt matter which religion you follow it keeps on showing up in history including in pagan religions judaism used to be pagan in ancient times as well    that which is hateful unto you do not do to your neighbor this is the whole of the torah the rest is commentary go forth and study hillel
the disaffection of the gods lost of the gods favor the gods turning against your wishes and aims
  jews never cease to be weasely and subversive
  that which works in opposition to the interests of the tribe  at least they were honest about it
was gass right
yes
what are the passions of the welleducated
no
  religion when approached correctly can be for the properly educated too theologians for example
    nah just sports what in the fuck else are people supposed to talk about
  sex money and drugs
  literature upperclass sports travelling science
  finance
yes especially for politics    art and alcohol
brrrrrrrrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaapapap  papapap  pappapapapapapapapapap  papap  pap  brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrt plopploplopoploploplopfffffffffttttppssfffssshtttfffffftttt  braaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaap  paaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrapapap  pap  pap  plorrrtt  papap
  no no he is right religion in itself is for simpletons metaphysics are a different matter
where do i start with gass
  being a fanatic is for simpletons being a theologian is not
  where do i start with gass  b  and finish with the p  brrrrrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaap  braaaaap   haha  braaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaapapap  braaap haha
  cringe
  paying for sex
  yes an intellectual such as myself should be completely above rolling around in the mud and reading fairy tales we enjoy true art like graphic novels and electronic interactive storytelling
  t badly educated
  
  no the shit i dont like comprises the passions of the poorly educated
  maybe politics otherwise hes a fedora and a sadsack that was too fat to ever participate in sporting
  well educated people are often very passionate about left wing politics they tend to be enthusiastic about religion as well as long as its not christianity you can find lots of articles in left wing rags gushing about the teachings of islam or how we should all be practicing buddhist meditation techniques my university had a wear a hijab day so we could all learn about islam and how cool and nice it was
  everything that enjoys doesnt depend on culture level
  fornite minecraft and 6ix 9ine
  sports    martial arts    politics    selfgovernship    religion    god    and yet these are somehow wrong
  left wing politics  yikes
  depression
  religion is not the same as god
ummm sweaty the things i dont like are the passions of the people i dont like
  upperclass sports  wrong
  heroin
  based and redpilled
  bohemian grove holidays and pineal gland milkshakes
  and what about history history and politics are inseparable
  selfindulgence autismo impotence
  he probably meant partisan politics
  a fear of sports is a sign of retarded sexual and emotional maturity
    twitter beer guts cartoons
  how so children are often way more attracted to sports than adults are
  ardent sports fans seem really immature to me they seem to think that the ref and the opposing players should tailor the game so that their team wins every time they have no objectivity at all
    hes talking about the quazireligious spectacle sports has become sports culture not the act of engaging in sports in itself
  martial arts  tips
    norf
  gods not real nimrod
  yes  t political scientist
  yeah
  upperclass sports  sad
  travelling can be gauche most tourists are scum
how did the characters think of all those songs on the spot are we just supposed to believe that everyone in the world is musically inclined and able to think of rhyming songs just off the top of their heads for any given occasion or are we just not supposed to think about it like how in a musical the cast just starts singing but youre just supposed to get that its part of the entertainment and that in the actual story the cast isnt actually singing is lord of the rings a musical
he doesnt know how music and popular rhyme worked before the radio       kek
i thought it was strange to until i went to ireland
  theres nothing extraordinary about it    my father does this type of stuff all the time he will spontaneously start reciting lines or aphorisms from fontaine goethe or schiller that fit the situation as well as singing old german volk songs i plan to do the same for my children its great cultural exposure
  i grew up in a deracinated atomized world where people have no real connections to each other or a shared cultural history within which they relate to one another  welcome to modernity
anyone who says they dont skip the sonnets and poems are lying op just forget it
  musical tradition and ability is common to all peoples popular culture except todays westerners in any case its easy to appropriate what you and everyone already knows for an onthespot piece obviously not as clean as depicted but certainly emotional and serviceable
      
tfw you will never live in a technocratic monastery full of people who dedicate their lives to learning and practicing their field  tfw you will never create a modern secret equivalent of the knights templar
  become a fascist syndicalist
  you can still join monasteries or even drop by for retreats

the celibate monastic life is the greatest thing one can experience on earth even the most the most irreligious can experience the immense benefits that such a lifestyle provides academic celibacy used to be a thing it is remarkable how much clearer cleaner and creative the mind is if you dont have base distractions dragging you down and the consequences that stem from their indulgence constant and total interest and enjoyment from life when unchaste and focused on trivial hedonistic pleasures everything outside of them is a chore and the whatever pleasure gained from those experiences passes the moment they end and worse if indulged to their utmost extent eventually manifest in habituation and youre on autopilot all the time the more i dive into the study of the brain and cognitive science the more i realize the necessity of such lifestyles for advancing humanity beyond our animalistic confines once you go to the extreme end of materialism as i have the conclusions of instill more fear in the indulgence of fleshly pleasures than the threat of an eternal hell ever could it shows that the mind is not the idealistic singular cohesive entity that is you that you like to think it is the most distinguishing development is our prefrontal region and we throw this advancement in the trash we use it to further the ends of the more primal regions and in doing so reduce this remarkable region to nothing more than the means to attain pleasure the experience of being human is squandered to live like an animal to the subjection of whims beyond his control musonius rufus said in his lectures to relax the mind is to lose it how true that is we relax it and the next thing we know we are nothing more than slaves to habit and all sorts of nonsense thinking becomes a chore the mind itself atrophies zeal for life dies unrealized potential abounds and can be unlocked yet the innate programming seek pleasure is the one roadblock that is in our way the one that will hijack your life and kill it making you a slave the rest of your days to instant gratification
  well deserve you my man    its true these zombies that drudge their way through life on autopilot are the saddest thing i feel sorry for their children raising a child without having read the canon first ought to be called child abuse

    there is no good literature featuring asexual characters that specifically identify with the modern understanding of asexual    youre better off watching bojack horseman for todd chavez than reading something like pic related funnily enough there are actually goodreads reviews of this book from asexuals who said they hated it    however    there are certain characters in literature that might be considered asexual even though the author nor the character would have ever used that terminology    for instance jean valjean from les miserables never once thought of banging fantine nor did he ever try to marry and give cosette a new mother its possible that he was not only ace but aro as well
  this
      fucking kek
scouting for boys not even kidding
  brief summary
  bp was a cleanliness and celibacy freak genuinely figured that sex was a chore one did to provide children for britain the rest of the book is imperial levels of madness too but the personal care bits are straight from the mind of an asexual sperger
  his marriage was hilariously asexual too but its long after he was massacring the enemy and scouting for boys  in january 1912 badenpowell was en route to new york on a scouting world tour on the ocean liner ss arcadian when he met olave st clair soames4950 she was 23 while he was 55 they shared the same birthday 22 february they became engaged in september of the same year causing a media sensation due to badenpowells fame to avoid press intrusion they married in private on 30 october 1912 at st peters church in parkstone51 the scouts of england each donated a penny to buy badenpowell a wedding gift a car note that this is not the rollsroyce they were presented with in 1929 there is a monument to their marriage inside st marys church brownsea island    badenpowell and olave lived in pax hill near bentley hampshire from about 1919 until 193952 the bentley house was a gift of her father53 directly after he had married badenpowell began to suffer persistent headaches which were considered by his doctor to be of psychosomatic origin and treated with dream analysis9 the headaches disappeared upon his moving into a makeshift bedroom set up on his balcony
  im proud to be asexual
my girlfriend is a pleb and ive been pushing some books to her and she seems to be enjoying some of them so far she has liked reading the sherlock holmes series the most but didnt like brave new world and 1984 at all so what should i recommend to her next
  the secret history by donna tartt its a genuinely good book but appeals to girls sensibilities its engaging without being too thematically weighty its a good bridge between pleb stuff and serious lit its pageturny without being mindnumbing and it features a prominent character that the narrator compares to holmes a few times its the perfect recommendation for her i think
will the chinese dominate literature in the future /lit/
  no they dont value it enough
  literature wont even exist in the future
  chinese is not a suitable language for literature except poetry the pictograms are simply to vague for accurate expression its why they write great poems and terrible instruction manuals
  chinese ai lit will flood the west
    well never see democratic china in our lifetime    well at least ma jian gets to bang this qt        also everyone should read the dark road
  it already does
  doubtful most of it reads like theyre scared their government is reading over their shoulder and trying to decide if they should send the secret police or not
  based chink gogol
  that kind of thing led to brilliant literature during tsarist russia and soviet russia
  except russians have souls and chinks are automatons
  they will eradicate it
  russians have souls
  theyll have some great novelists and as a market theyll dominate but they wont be a force itll be like a less noticeable situation as china and hollywood
  i hope so

blocks your path    a calm fulfillment the salutation of a pure juvenescence ascended from this infinite morning i gulped it down like sparkling wine that gentle cavalcade through the open country but it was less the gaping future than the environing persistence of an assured and familiar presence yet one already doomed which filled my heart to bursting distancing myself with all possible speed from my city i inhaled orsenna as deeply as i could fill my lungs i mused over how tenacious were the cords that bound me to this country like a woman whose overripe and overaffectionate loveliness holds you prisoner then from time to time into this moody solicitude crept like a sudden and alarming gust into warm night air that disturbing word war and the clear colors of the landscape around me shifted to a just perceptibly stormy hue

best novel ive ever read
  that translation for the title though
    the one that really got me on the guts right after the ending scene was one hundred years of solitude    it also happened with lolita but not as strong as with one hundred years of solitude    other books that made me feel in the presence of a supreme work of art were    war and peace  anna karenina  the death of ivan ilycht  kholstomer the story of a horse  memoirs of hadrian  the poems of emily dickinson  moby dick  the book of job    shakespeares poetic language is to me the greatest use of words that humaniy has yet achieved i never felt the same oh my god what a work of art feeling after finishing any of his plays in the same way that i felt with one hundred years of solitude or lolita or war and peace but the language of those plays is orders of magnitude superior to all of those other works

i know lotr gets way too much praise but maybe thats for a good reason its clearly a labor of love he put so much work so many years into his carefully crafted world when you read the books you arent just aware but you feel the echoes of something much deeper that there is a lore and history there that feels real and believable in the context of the stories and then you delve deeper reading his other tales of middle earth learning that lotr is just another tale in a world that he poured his life into     it is nothing short of a masterpiece if it is not a work of art then all of literature is nothing more than a tool that pseuds use to make themselves look smarter and more sophisticated than they really are

  unironically my diary desu
yet nazis were not fond of céline who accused adolf hitler of secretly being jewish because he was not ridding france of its jews fast enough in his diary for december 1941 the german novelist ernst jünger then a nazi officer noted that for two hours céline ranted to him that german soldiers should shoot hang exterminate the jews céline recommended that jews be rooted out neighborhood by neighborhood house by house if i carried a bayonet id know what has to be done in reaction to this vehemence jünger referred to céline as a stone age man    what was his problem
  jews owned the paris publishing houses
junger later said that maybe he made too much of a caricature of celine whatever that means
  what was his problem  the jews obviously
  not ridding france of its jews fast enough  problem our fucking guy
  france had the jewish problem much worse than other nations they still do he was also sort of a hateful psychotic and fixated on petty resentment towards this or that group really despised bosses and shop keepers too for reasons related to his awful childhood and adolescence
  it was much worse than that the early degeneracy that was to pervade modernism and everything thereafter came out of paris jew infestation problem in the theater music and art realms as well journey came out in 1932 which was when a lot of the now high modernists were more mature and turning away from the jewish stuff and calling jews out pound eliot deman stravinsky etc
  why everybody hate them can you explain    seems like they are hated for different ressons
  asking an extreme genocidal antisemite on 4chan why people hate jews  have fun
  now that is based and redpilled
  because thats how nature works groups compete against each other for resources jews live in other peoples countries and cant defend or feed themselves though so to acquire resources and power they have to conquer/attack from the inside through deception manipulation etc
  as you can see this is 4channel and only legitimate grievances against jews will be conveyed here
  how do these hateful antisocial violent types survive and not get filtered out by the system im a quiet unassuming schizo that could never hurt a fly but im pushed aside like an alien do the normies really fear what they cant understand
  jüngers problem just a bit weak in his convictions intimidated by celines vigour clearly
  what he  said about competition and also hating is a good way to express your own unconscious urges to destroy because your mom didnt love you
  your own unconscious urges to destroy because your mom didnt love you  fuck off freud everyone knows your a hack now

    hey mine too    tfw ive had to learn italian by myself because it didnt get passed down in the family
  greetings from palermo
the il gatopardo movie was amazing i highly recommend it as a follow up to the book    burt lancaster is magnificent in it
  calscibetta i come    i should learn italian ive put some time into french i can learn that then to italian
just brough a copy of the bible from a charity shop    is there a particular order i should read the books in or should i just read it from front to back  im not a christian i just want too learn about it
you could try and just read it front to back it gets real dull in areas though    if youre strapped for time genesis exodus job jonah ecclesiastes for ot and just read the entirety of the nt
read the new testament
  read the new testament the most important part of the bible is jesus  after you read the 4 gospels i would say genesis then into psalms
  start with mark
read genesis and exodus then skip to the new testament and read it in order read the rest the ot after digesting the nt a lot of it is boring with flashes of brilliance dispersed throughout
  if you didnt get a kjv then its gonna be extremely watered down the kjv is the only english bible worth having due to its superb style and form
  exodus  aka how to construct your portable desert tabernacle what a borefest    the bible can be interesting as a work of pseudohistory or if youre interested in kabbalah but fuck there are some dull bits youd think god would have hired better writers
  the first half of exodus is essential reading i agree that all the tabernacle shit is boring though
  spoiler jesus dies   he comes back
begin with the new testament  begin with the book of matthew then johns gospel the luke then after luke read the book of acts straight after as they were written consecutively then read through the book of romans and after try hebrews then and only then go through genisis exodus deuteronomy and joshua    st augustine said where the bible is unrational its intended to be allegorical read it as an individual learning about with the whole deal is about dont read it with an agenda to conquer it like some spiritless people can if something doesnt make sense look up online what its supposed to mean get the niv version first if you want to understand it read through the odd psalm occasionally 915023 are goods ones
  wow like sherlock holmes
  aka how to construct your portable desert tabernacle what a borefest  nice one  i finished exodus a couple of days ago and this is accurate for the second half
daily reminder that the bible is just an arbitrary mishmash of ancient texts with no cohesion or consistency whatever the word of god my ass
  book of revelation was alright rest of it is mostly shit
  revelation is borderline canon they only included for qabalistic reasons to get the book count up to 66
      how does it feel having a stimuli dependency so great that you cant even read history
  daily reminder  no cohesion  literally signs off as t angry atheist  art
  i get where all the people saying gospels first are coming from but genesis exodus new testament is my recommendation
start with the new testament  read it through imo then go to the books of poetry job ecclesiastes song of solomon psalms and proverbs and then go to the torah genesis exodus leviticus numbers and deuteronomy and then read through the rest of the old testament
  read thomas paines the age of reason instead
im reading it cover to cover and its not that bad so far once you get past some of the dry bits in exodus leviticus numbers and deuteronomy
  questioning god    get a load of this retard
    start with the book of john and then do romans from there i recommend getting into the historical books like the first 5 books

im interested in philosophers who explore the connection between marx and aristotle for some time ive felt that marxs project has many aristorelian assumptions which are not addressed by either camp  his conception of human nature rejection of utilitarianism and deontology to end up with something very close to virtue ethics the persistent effort to locate the form and essence of social processes via qualitative analysis etc macintyre seems to be the major thinker who goes some ways to reconnect these two traditions but in my opinion abandons marx too early there are useful aristotelian approaches even in his later work like capital ive read a few academic articles which propose a closer examination in this vein but not much beyond that  is very good worth looking up on libgen can anyone help me
  the book marx and aristotle nineteenthcentury german social theory and classical antiquity is on libgen the article german social ethics and the return to greek philosophy marx and aristotle is also available some excerpts    the marxist concept of praxis is to be understood as close to what aristotle meant by phronesis practical knowledge     praxis interpreted as ethical and political critique and as political action is similar to aristotles use of the term marxs understanding of the relation between political action and knowledge is similar to aristotles critique o f ethics and politics as a science marxs analysis of idealism empiricism rationalism and positivism his concept o f science as critique and the tem porality and historicity that underlie its foundations directs one to look more closely at aristotle for answers to the difficult issues behind the dia lectic of theory and practice praxis is noninstrumental nonpredictive and nonexplanatory knowledge  it is prudence to act in concrete historical situations according to principles that are universal concrete ie they are not theoretical or truly scientific principles but they are achieved in the desire for the good life and happiness within a society that realizes the telos o f man    the goal of science is not the creation of a technocratic elite or the instrumentalization of science but the creation of the conditions for the enlightened emancipation of humanity in the free community knowledge truth and rationality develop within the social matrix and are conditioned by the forms and structures of their institu tional setting truth involves the dialectical interaction of subjectivity and objectivity to the point that objectivity realizes its concept in the subjective revolutionary consciousness of the working class and the latter in turn realizes the objective conditions of fundamental structural change    for aristotle the criterion o f truth is that which led to the good and to happiness while for marx it is that which leads to liberation and humanization of consciousness in b o t h cases truth is determined not through the classical correspondence o f consciousness and reality but in the process o f acting itself

id love to get my family members each a book for christmas can i get some suggestions my mother and i watched the film the survivalist together and that triggered a desire for her to get into gardening i was wondering if there are any interesting books that deal with nature or perhaps living off the land she loved all the a song of fire and ice books too if that helps  my younger brother is interested in history and is fascinated with the engineering of guns and old weaponry i was thinking of getting him something nonfiction but im open to any suggestions he enjoyed reading dune and catcher in the rye  my older brother doesnt really read but he travels a lot for work so i want to get him something to entertain himself on his flights give me something fun that will hopefully pique his interest to read more hes big into tech and futurismnot the italian movement i havent read any jeff vandermeers work but i was thinking maybe one of his books might be a good fit  my dad also doesnt read and is probably the hardest one to get something he loves to cook so i was picturing something pertaining to that maybe set in germany since hes of german descent could even be biographies of famous chefs preferable not a cookbook    id love to hear any suggestions even if the books themselves dont pertain to any of their interests thanks

i wouldve liked to have been a youth under a fascist dictatorship books for this feel    anyone else feel this way im not even a fascist
atleast the fascists like white people
  teenage boys are drawn to fascism because they always imagine themselves as the ones giving the orders this does not turn out to be the case
  not the case for me thats why i specified youth in my op
      i swear bukowski wrote about this somewhere he said something to that effect but it was more base than that something about just not being told what to do and being strong
  wrong fascism is about the youth about craziness and action and celebration
  harry potter
  i think boiling it down to emotional punchy words like celebration is probably the more accurate way to describe what draws people in to fascism when it happens    
  youre naively assuming that blind obedience doesnt appeal to people probably because you like practically everyone else on this board grew up in a western democracy that stressed the value of personal freedom and the sovereignty of the individual above all else
  people want to serve and have direction also destroying things under the sanction of authority being able to relieve yourself from the burden of conscience and responsibility people arent attracted to giving orders theyre attracted to the idea of being given orders and thus permission to that liberate and express their dark energies a regime that fulfills innermost desires hitler was perceived not as a conservative autocrat a king or regent to keep people in line but as an avatar of the peoples wishes the false expectation of the fascist fantasy is that you will be one of the people wearing the jackboots but in real life even dedicated fascists and nazis found themselves alienated downcast stripped of rights spied on send to camps the revolution always ends up eating its own children

  overpopulation is a myth there is a problem of too many people living in close proximity but not a problem of overpopulation overpopulation implies a lack of land available for a growing population there is plenty people need to spread out
  thisthe bible and the quran
  overpopulation implies a lack of land available for a growing population   it also implies lack of resources you fucking dumbass
  yea whiteys need to give us browns some room
  funny how the more you try to keep marx suppressed the more he keeps coming back to haunt you
  no what you do is stuff a pillow case stuffed of econophysics and genetics and beat them to a bloody pulp to prevent it from contracting marcuse
  its almost as if he wasright
  its more so that marxists are ideologically closer to religious zealots than other philosophical adherents meaning they just get bolder and more encouraged if you try to destroy them unfortunately
children shouldnt read anything but their religious book and history books until they turn 21 especially not fucking political ideology
  most religious books are political especially bible and quran
  i agree
  oh yeah well just give them all the apolitical ideologyfree religion and history books we have lying around lol
  haha no
  hunger games catching fire was totally lost without reading the first one

  his solutions may be wrong but he was right about capitalism its too unfair
  it would make more sense to you if you understood how bad and unlivable the wages were compared to what the owner of the machines used by the workers made in the boomimg times of industrialisation
  land  do you honestly think overpopulation is about fucking land  what are finite resources on a finite planet  what is carrying capacity kys  
  obligatory reply by someone who hasnt read a drop of marx but feels the need to have an opinion anyway  thanks somebody had to to it
  get this conclusion without the proper historical context
  its perfectly fair
what are the best stoner flicks /tv/
oh shit this isnt /tv/
  start with the greeks
i want to make a novel about some old dude who saved the world but right now the world is at peace and he cant get the goverment to pay his pensum and hes old and everyone has forget about him    is a fantasy version of the el coronel doesnt have who write to him from gabo
sounds interesting fren good luck
  
  cool i once tried writing a fanfic of samurai jack along those lines except less cynical and more bittersweet  i wish you luck if handled correctly you could make a pretty powerful statement about the burden of age the poor societal treatment of our elders and even an encouraging tale of finding value in oneself even after our best days are long behind us
inuyashiki desu
i feel like i understand the basics to enjoying life better than the average person learning that success isnt what society sees but whatever you think success is same with happiness i see people on here concerned about fame and things     a lot of people want to be famous but we know statistically most people wont be famous so try to stop worrying about that and just do what you enjoy do anything and stop worrying if its good go out and do worrying is the biggest problem most people have in life     if anyone wants to add any life lessons theyve learned put it down
  another one ive learned and i feel statistics support this life has lots of ups and downs so try to remember that if you feel like youve made a mistake that will ruin your life or that lack of action is ruining your life like i said before just keep moving
    seems you are climbing the scale of conciousness moving to a higher paradigm of pure rationality and its accompanying solidness and fortitudes    now  find the value in people and in what cases you are willing to meet your creator in servitude of these people thank me later
  give up early  whoa insightful
get laid you fucking loser
  hurried and worried until were buried and theres no curtain call lifes a very funny proposition after all
  op here again i forgot to add one more thing clean your bloody room
following any conventional religion and just accepting doctrine some dude with biases wrote down  not developing your own moral creed by constructing a unique personal religion incorporating the most sensible parts of other religions into your own weltanschauung as you see fit  do you really think books written thousands of years ago can understand the universe better than you give yourself some credit
  give yourself some credit  no
i do exactly that  the good lord has provided us with everything most importantly free will     everyone gets to fuck up as they please if they receive mercy at the end  who cares     jesus is my homie and mostly i try not to betray his ideals which isnt easy being a needy lump of flesh with free will and conscience
    not much of a fan of the bible either but appearntly theres far more to it than just the scribble of a thousand sandniggers     
  made me spit jager top kek
  do you really think books written thousands of years ago can understand the universe better than you give yourself some credit  i give myself enough credit to recognize that compared to someone like aristotle i might aswell be a vegetable
why would i even need to construct a moral creed theres no god so its not like that matters
  how do you act in society without a moral creed
  however i see fit t different
  you have to be over 18 to post on this website

what are the best intro to philosophy that gives a basic understanding of the field    not very deep books only introductory ones that maybe later i can deep into one of the major philosophers
  my diary desu
  internet encyclopedias then read a major philosopher that is relevant
  wikipedia page for philosophy
    wikipedia  these niggers arent even being ironic
  we know your teacher wont let you cite it but theres nothing inherently wrong with wikipedia kid
  yeah its a good starting point and explains everything even a dummy can understand  its a good introduction even if its not perfect
  wikipedia
bertrand russel maybe   mfw  
  im working my way through think by simon blackburn and id recommend it as a good intro book
stirner
why do people even ask this when the answer is obviously the dialogues
look it up its free
all the history of or anthology of  or guide to  types of books are pure trash and will at best give you the most surfacelevel typically misconstrued and misinterpreted version of philosophy either get real and read the primary texts or fuck off
  thats why you read both the secondary and primary texts in order to get a better understanding check em
history of philosophy without any gaps  
  just look up the definition of philosphy
  please tell me your joking
  do i really need to explain why wikipedia is an abysmal source anyone can edit it
  yet it works out just fine
  dammmm i checkd em  also ik russels history of western philosophy is hated on but i enjoyed reading it you gotta read the primary sources in conjunction w/ the secondary for sure
i had a near death experience today i have been suffering from a bad sinus infection for the past couple days and some blood came out of my nose and i got really dizzy and light headed and i thought that i was literally dying    and a thought popped into my head as i endured this vasovagal response to seeing blood the thought was that i should have been a better person i should have done better im not actually religious i dont think that i have knowledge of what happens when i die but i had the thought that im going to die and i should have done better i shouldnt have lied so much i should have helped people more and i also felt that maybe me dying is justice for being a shitty person    it doesnt really make sense to me though i havent really been that shitty of a person yeah i stole like 20 bucks from my brother when i was in high school yeah i stole a candy bar from a gas station once yeah ive told a lot of lies but none of them resulted in anyone actually getting hurt or anything bad happening    i felt really scared because i really felt like i was dying but i also felt like i deserve to die why did i feel like i deserve to die what ideas are there about nearly dying or at least feeling like youre dying
  who cares  oh im dying better feel guilty about my life  it doesnt matter if you were or werent a good enough person because you will literally been extinct forever in the next moment anyway the only way you could justify feeling like you werent a good enough person is if there is something after death waiting dor you but there isnt
lol kill yourself pussy
      badass
  you feel that way because you have an underdeveloped sense of selfworth    after today why dont you take more action to accomplish things youre personally excited about do it for yourself and the more you accomplished the more youll be able to help other people
    didnt even read op but you people ruin /lit/
  homie had a bloody nose and called it a near death experience
great diary almost like mine desu
  you might be on to something but nothing really excites me anymore like in a genuine good faith sort of way nothing genuinely excites me    i also got really dizzy and felt like i was going to pass out and never wake up it was that sort of feeling like this is the end that gave me the feelings i also though that im only 28 is it even possible for me to die from an infection but i just drank some water and then in 10 minutes i was fine
the other day i was out the a couple of old friends of mine we sat at a shitty pub as we usually do sinking beers and telling each other about shit we never really did dave interrupted abruptly and coming in quickly from his fourth visit to the bathroom in what seemed as many minutes hey milco i left something for you in the restroom just look on the toilet he was sweating a little anxious curiosity got the better of me and i obliged in his generosity but what could it be i was hoping it wasnt another turd     as i entered the shit infested cesspool of a toilet i bline towards my fate into the stall where a toilet stood oddly the walls held more shit than a new dehli street corner and the floor covered in stale piss really made you wonder why there was a toilet at all then i see it a small spaced out white substance i can only assume is the greatly discussed intoxicant colloquially known as cocaine i quiver in fear but the excitement of new experiences takes over and i snort it all     i feel great saturated with immense confidence i beam out of the toilet with a new pep in my step until suddenly i catch my reflection in the mirror the horror that followed cannot be described in words i rush towards my reflection with an obscene gait i double look then slowly raise a hand to my nose its blood but how cancer aids ebolaids suddenly my life flashed before my eyes i rushed back to dave and co i yell out in horror im not actually religious dave glared with genuine agreement i continued  i dont think i have the knowledge of what happens when i die shut the fuck up you cooked cunt replied jimbo but i couldnt they had to know it doesnt really make sense to me though i havent really been that shitty of a person the group chuckles awkwardly and i went on i once stole 20 bucks off my brother and killed 7 baby niglets
  i have been suffering from a bad sinus infection for the past couple days  what are you doing here sadler
    kek
  do you want to have an existence which is easy effortless simple and stressfree maybe you can get excited about something like that
nigga isnt sinus infection instantly cured by some simple procedure i remember having it when i was like 10 just went to the doctor and had the pus sucked out of my nose it was quite painful but it got better instantly
i had a near death experience today i read ops post and my nose started to bleed and i got really dizzy is he this much of a faggot i thought to myself turns out he was every op ive seen over the years on this website flashed before my eyes none of them were as much of a fag as this op this is it i thought its over i closed the thread so i didnt spend my last moments staring at it any longer suddenly i was fine books for this feel

first time reading faulkner and good lord this was amazing reading the sound and the fury next where do i go after that
youve already peaked as i lay dying and light in august are both amazing along with go down moses from there you have only great literature no more masterpieces
  as i lay dying is shorter and slightly less experimental that tsatf but is a masterpiece nonetheless definitely the easiest of his famous four to read     light in august is in my opinion the weakest of his famous works faulkner experiments here less than in his other works it is unique unique among them in that it is straightforwardly structured and that the novel is told plainly in the third person it doesnt experiment around with perspective and viewpoint in the way faulkner does in tsatf as i lay dying and absalom     go down moses stands out as his lessdiscussed masterpiece its a collection of short stories ranging from like 20100 pages long but some stories such as the bear and was and delta autumn showcase some of the strongest and most emotive faulkner it further cements faulkners intent across his famous works especially aa and tsatf and its a really comparatively easy and fun read    his other collected short stories are outstanding as well a rose for emily barn burning red leaves that evening sun etc etc etc faulkner was a master at the short story as well as the novel    cant speak on his other novels unfortunately except to say that theyre probably great as well though not on the same level as tsatf and absalom
    did this mad nigga start with absalom absalom is you crazy
  definitely the easiest of his famous four to read  thats light in august though i agree that its the weakest as well     it doesnt experiment around with perspective and viewpoint  and thats every other of his novels hes kind of a one hit wonder
  found it on the floor of a used bookstore and knew absolutely nothing about it took me about 100 pages to really get into it and since then ive been obsessed with this book honestly might be the best thing ive ever read

  not knowing camus is pronounced shamoo
  this shit always makes me laugh
i dont understand this retarded obsession with pronouncing proper names correctly but only when it comes to proper names of important people nobody seems to be bothered that common names like john and james are spoken differently in various languages whats even worse is the sort of dishonest selectiveness pretentious pricks like op would display by choosing go to through the extra effort of learning how to say certain names right but disregard others entirely like ive never witnessed anyone attempt saying dostoevsky like a slavic person or virgil in classical latin but when it comes to descartes we better grab our baguettes and start dropping half the letters and say the rs like a person with speech impediment or else op might have a booty explosion no faggot it says descartes so when i communicate in english im going to pronounce every fucking letter cause im not some bitch frog fuck you

nothing depresses me more than realizing orwell is only really remembered for his bolshevik pigs and comically blatant dictatorship  the road to wigan pier is some of the most powerful beautiful sincere and thoughtprovoking pieces of political writing ever put to paper a thousand times more meaningful than 1984 at the very least and yet it is all but forgotten outside fringe leftie circles why
why pepl no liek wat grug liek
  hated by rightists for pointing out the immorality of unconstrained capitalism hated by leftists for pointing out the retardedness of mainstream socialism
  because it cant be used to shit on the ruskies
why  precisely because it is some of the most powerful beautiful sincere and thoughtprovoking pieces of political writing ever put to paper nobody is scared of people reading 1984  its so ridiculous and onthenose its practically useless everyone is scared of people learning of orwells actual politics  it damns everyone and everything worth damning left or right its almost impossible to morally argue against orwells socialism so the next best thing is to just keep it out of peoples minds
seriously nothing depresses you more than some dude from a century ago not being recognized enough i wish i had your problems
  this board is for gentlemen of leisure away with you smelly unfortunate
  havent read it yet but from the excerpts ive seen from it i believe you much of what he said about the state of politics then uncannily matches what i see today
two wurld wors aend wun wurld cap
  its almost impossible to morally argue against orwells socialism    its almost impossible to be more wrong
hes a good journalist with a few good insights but thats it him going in on juicedrinkers and feminists is not interesting especially when he provides no positive arguments prosocialism in the text    i am from wigan and and i like the first half of the book and its descriptions of the traditional working class even if that is a minority opinion that amongst most wiganers the second half is mostly boring and antiintellectual
  uh did you read the book in the op
orwell is a trash writer what is more he was a pussy and a brainlet i spit on his grave
  the guy took a bullet in a neck fighting for his political principles whatever he is a pussy he is not
  he took a bullet in a neck
  most people in this country will do anything to get off this island for a brief adventure here people work and walk every day in total obscurity earning a low wage toiling on as best they can dying and being replaced by others who do the same the reality of life in britain which in my experience is largely defined by a sort of weary selfeffacing humour that barely hides a sort of consistent lowlevel bleakness underneath it all
  him going in on juicedrinkers and feminists is not interesting especially when he provides no positive arguments prosocialism in the text  the second half is mostly boring and antiintellectual  i love how after all of these decades orwell still pisses off other socialists because he pointed out the working class dislike the pretentious weirdos who waste all of their time rambling about complex communist theories if you really want socialism to succeed you have to convert the working class but the socialists of orwells time cared more about pseudointellectual masturbation and appealing to fellow pseuds and modern socialists do the exact same shit nothing has changed
  working class dislike the pretentious weirdos who waste all of their time rambling about complex communist theories if you really want socialism to succeed you have to convert the working class but the socialists of orwells time cared more about pseudointellectual masturbation and appealing to fellow pseuds and modern socialists do the exact same shit nothing has changed  proles couldnt exert much critical thought back then let alone now that the modern day working class in this country anyway are working class/poor simply because they are unintelligent and choose to be uneducated as they are given every opportunity to better themselves money is no longer such a limiting factor as it was back then working class people cant be expected to know anything about what is good for them beyond the most superficial ways of thinking what else do you expect if they were actually intelligent and could figure these things out for themselves they wouldnt be working class
  the point of the second half of the road to wigan pier is socialist circles are so deeply rooted in faggotry theyre hurting the cause instead of helping it he was basically saying we need to sort ourselves out so we can accomplish our goal also keep in mind that the road to wigan pier was published in the left book club he didnt bother providing prosocialism arguments because he was preaching to the choir check out his other nonfiction if you want to read his prosocialism arguments
  i dont know man im mostly speaking out of my ass here but from what ive seen while theres still plenty of meaningless theory gushing out of academy and publications like n1 or viewpoint like sewer outflow pipes twitter/youtube socialists and young folk like the ones over at current affairs and jacobin seem to finally understand this they focus heavily on the simple humane messages at the heart of socialism      now that the modern day working class in this country anyway are working class/poor simply because they are unintelligent and choose to be uneducated as they are given every opportunity to better themselves  it amazes me every single fucking time how fucking ignorant conservatives/liberals are of the reality of poverty in this country  like jesus fucking christ are you for real money doesnt matter you have the mentality and unwarranted elitism of a goddamn 15 year old  and besides you do understand that no matter how smart or dumb the lower classes are there will always have to be someone scrubbing the toilets right
  you have a tiny number of socialists that follow in the steps of orwell like clouscard and michéa but they are reviled as being reactionary by the rest of the left
  money doesnt matter  i never said that i only meant to say its not as much of a limiting factor in regards to higher education  and besides you do understand that no matter how smart or dumb the lower classes are there will always have to be someone scrubbing the toilets right  the few hundred thousand immigrants they import every year without fail yes
  clouscard   the state was the superstructural authority of capitalist repression this is why marx denounces it but today with globalisation the inversion is total whereas the statenation could be the means of oppression of a class by another it becomes the means of resisting globalisation it is a dialectical process  this reads like a parody  it is a dialectical process is like a fucking punchline to a joke
  twitter/youtube socialists and young folk like the ones over at current affairs and jacobin    they are still extremely pozzed but yeah its as bad as it used to be
  so are you a rightwinger or a socialist if youre a socialist why are you a socialist you seem to view the working class as revolting idiots who are beyond redemption
  judging but his other post  he is a trumpster
  its hardly a joke people like corbyn that semisupport brexit or the left that opposes the eu came to the same conclusion
  people dont choose to be unintelligent and uneducated    its the reality of growing up in circumstances where you are surrounded by antiintellectualism and generation upon generation of failures in education leading to stagnated social mobility    in such circumstances as these it is very difficult for the young working class to succeed and thrive at school where the value of learning is nullified and studying becomes a chore they simply have no understanding of the need to succeed and most of the time they have no belief in their ability to    its also why we see a lot of educational attainment coming from second generation immigrant families as they are very cognizant of the sacrifices that have been made by their families and often have parents who are motivated in seeing them succeed in most working class communities where low education pervades you have a culture of failure that is ingrained into people from very early on    it is much more complex than these people suck at life because they dont give a shit
  you seem to view the working class as revolting idiots who are beyond redemption  working class people in this country for the most part taken advantage of and exist for the amusement of everyone above them they are simply inferior why else would they be working class in modern day britain social mobility is the highest its ever been if they knew how to better their situation or cared to they could easily rise up to the fast growing lower middle class and above but they dont so they remain working class and they continue to raise their children poorly and continue the cycle
  so youre not a socialist
  do you live in the uk have you seen the people here or grown up around them gone to school with them worked with them
  its also why we see a lot of educational attainment coming from second generation immigrant families as they are very cognizant of the sacrifices that have been made by their families    only in the us in europe sans britain first generation migrants fare better than their kids overall europe gets very different populations though and obviously it doesnt apply to certain ethnocultural groups such as asians
  i wish it had killed him i live in the worst timeline
  beautiful sincere  sincere  kek
  how is it not sincere
            frankly embarrassing posts
educate working class retards  oh shit my socialist society still needs shit shovelers and grave diggers  just tell them they are like totally equal to everybody like the people who sit in a university all day    socialism really is just social engineering by its roots isnt it
  genius is always known by its lesser work
  him going in on juicedrinkers and feminists is not interesting  it is interesting because its literally whats happening right now   orwell complains of hippies and cranks with their absurd behaviors and opinions diluting socialism and distracting the working class from the important matters
  i became a socialist after reading it even though my parents are working class who got me out of it and managed to sent me to university  still fuck fags and trannies
  coz if they did no one can use his writings to own the leftists epic style
orwells best books are actually those that are not political coming up for air is one of my favourite books
  based and krasnopilled
  shooting an elephant is the goat orwell work  prove me wrong
  his journalism is great in general down and out is also surprisingly entertaining and funny and its not as political as the rest of his work
   working class retards   shit my socialist society still needs shit shovelers and grave diggers   tell them they are like totally equal to everybody like the people who sit in a university all day  luckily automation will force the powers that be to wipe them all out or almost all of them anyway
  who cares what fringe circles think orwell is considered an influential writer nonetheless and his lesser known works are fantastic if you want an empathy towards the working class he was like the ken loach of literature down and out in paris and london was great too
  dont worry these gammon cunts are embarrassments in the uk too
  smug pepe and wojak poster has to use meme images as an argument  colour me surprised
the classic
ive read his all his essays recently the most fun and thought provoking literature i had in a long time honestly some are incredibly relevanta notable feat since he wrote them 70 years ago or more
  this
  read coming up for air if you want something on the working class perpetually working for nothing and being replaced when they wear out
im about finished with down and out why are the swear words all blanked out i dont know london slang from the early 20th century so i filled in most of the blanks with fuck
in terms of plot description character development etc
  not dosto for fucks sake
  agreed camus maybe
  me
  no way plot nonexistent character nonexistent
  he didnt need to
  like thats an argument
you know its true perfect pacing perfect plotting perfect prose perfect characters
  ma boi
  homer
stendhal
  david foster wallace or pynchon
guimarães rosa
  based whitman poster
  steinbeck
  agreed reading nothing but tolstoy for a month almost killed my enjoyment of other literature
shakespeare and tolstoy
  perfect pacing perfect plotting perfect prose perfect characters  reminds me of a time in around 2006 or so when some journalist asked nadal if he thought federer had any weaknesses rafa looked pretty sheepish and said something like well i think his backhand is perfect his forehand that is perfect too he has a perfect serve his movement around the court is perfect
  unironically this guy
  i love american lit and have a huge bias to it but for fucks sake dfw pynchon and steinbeck steinbeck is probably my favorite but god no he is not the best like it or not plebs but its probably shakespeare i could see the argument for a few others tolstoy melville virgil hell maybe even faulkner but yall got it fucked up
    i hope this is bait
   almost killed my enjoyment of other literature  agreed my professor told me he was the best writer ever i agreed with him then started to rad tolstoy works after that i quited the major
  god
hard question to answer shakespeare is the most important writer in our canon and my favourite writer but the best to compare his plays to a later work like say mobydick is like comparing apples and oranges
homer and sheikh pier
  so do you prefer apples or oranges anon
  shakespeare is a meme
  shakespeare is a meme  invented by bacon  
  depends on my mood shakespeare whoever he was is an endless source of joy mobydick has a haunting power which in part derives from is informed by shakespeare the most under rated writers in english are probably pg wodehouse and when at his best jack vance wodehouse especially was a master stylist but in a certain sense the foundation of it all are the plays
  wrong it has to be marlowe
for me its jane austen
  marlowe fucking died before many of shakespeares plays were even written
  well shakespeare was the literary executor of marlowes estate so
  this could be true but much of marlowes writing is pretty milquetoast why the fuck did he not stage these plays in his own lifetime
  yep
  why does everyone overlook ben jonsons accounts when theyre freaking out over how little record there is of shakespeare
has to be herman melville his writing has this incredible passion behind it that sounds like its being written in this almost stream of consciousness flurry in terms of the sentence structure and how well everything flows but somehow every single word choice and description is absolutely perfect to the point where i have to imagine that he either poured over every single sentence for hours getting them just right or he had the best instincts of any author ive ever read and hes more than just the guy who wrote mobydick i think the confidence man is as good as mobydick while managing to feel completely different if you loved the denser parts of mobydick as well as its humor youd love the confidence man his short stories are phenomenal as well plus mardi and pierre are great and very much worth reading     also im not sure when or why it became cool to shit on dostoevsky but it makes me sad hes one of my favourite writers as well whereas i always found tolstoy pretty overrated
  op believes there is a best author of all time  kek
  i always found tolstoy pretty overrated    i hear way more about dostoevsky than tolstoy i personally prefer tolstoy although i like both
  i loved moby dick ill pick up the confidence man which short stories by him would you recommend
  enjoy the confidence man can be a bit of a mindfuck the absolute essential would be billy budd which is probably more of a novella considering its length but its a masterpiece beyond that my personal favourites/recommendations would be benito cereno the encantadas and bartleby the scrivener though ive never read one from him i havent enjoyed almost every publisher who has released some of melvilles work has released a collection of his short stories usually called billy budd and other short works or something like that and all those stories i mentioned will be in there so just grab one of those from penguin or oxford world classics and youre set
time will reveal to you the fact that i am correct
  john milton for epic and tolstoy for novel
  i had to read confidence man in high school and found it boring as hell all we did was examine the historical contexts and the references he was making the writing was nice but i had no interest in all the vignettes i hated the doctor one    i loved moby dick though will probably pick up mardi/pierre if you really think they are worth it
  probably shakespeare or joyce i think pynchon and aeschylus are more enjoyable to read but theyre really not on the same power level as the first pair there is a very narrow range of actually genius literature in existence just as there are only a few composers who are worth studying or lauding endlessly art is not a field of parity and variegated olympian talents everyone converges towards similar styles similar attempts at dominating their field and eventually just a half dozen or so names emerge which are so much more potent than their talented peers youd have to be demonstrably low iq to not notice the superiority chasm between joyce and borges or celine or stendhal gogol nabokov is incredibly obvious
  chasm between english writer and french russian spanish writers is incredibly obvious  lmao sorry but having one great work does not put you on the same planet as shakespeare
  your greatest masterpice was your diary desu
  so nabokov gets btfo
  dude i love camus but hes definitely not the goat author
    i feel like this is a foolishly pointless discussion you know art is subjective right
  honestly stephen king i know ill get shit for that but hes super good at character development and plots his prose is very unique as well
  agreed except for perfect pacing
conrad
  stefany myeers  jk rowling  emely bronty   mary shelley    they are the best
12179025  youre so fucking unfunny
paulo coelho
  shakespeare and tolstoy    this      tolstoy is the greatest novelist of all time and one of the greatest short story writers he is a master of the pure and crystalline realistic prose and his characters are generally perfect as representations of how human beings really are he constructs them with small touches patiently again and again and again and in the end you really feel like here it is a fellow who was really perceptive of others around him and who studied himself with so much surgical fanaticism that he always knew how he would react in a given situation if he was a person with such and such tastes and characteristics     shakespeare is the greatest master of language of all time the greatest of all poets and his characters are examples of what human beings would be like if they knew how to expose their thoughts and feelings on the language of the angels they are not realistic but more like the figures on the frescoes of michelangelo
  i agree with you though calling shakespeare the greatest of all poets what about robert browning his dramatic monologues rival shakespeares poetry
i remember watching the top 100 literary fiction novels all time acording to /lit/ but never saved it    do anyone has it
    dont reply
so what was heidis take on the nigger and janny problem

  despite being a prematurely bald manlet had women swooning over him because of the pure power of his mind fucked every qt in paris  independently conquered an entire city for italy against the will of the italian government and then went to war against italy when they tried to make him leave  created the first fascist state appointed himself duce and decreed that music would be the fundamental principle of the state  killed his enemies by feeding them castor oil and making them shit themselves to death    the single most based and redpilled nigga to ever live
can someone please tell me what a janny is
  get the fuck out of here newfag
  niggerdasein is inferior because theyre not attracted to the lichtung women do nothing but chatter and janny is an instrumentalist who sees posters as nothing but gestell
  pls
  that youve created your own world of the nigger and the janny which are thinly veiled reflections of your own desires and ideals a world hampered and terminated by those words in endless repetition to file things into this block built autistic self revealing system which will only ever produce more niggerandjanny for you to define yourself against by devotion to their upkeep if he were the type to draw conclusions which he wasnt but i am i think hed assume youre a self hating niggerjanny being kept running on your own treadmill by cheap gay aesthetics but thats just me spitballing
  le dannunzio meme  cringe
kirkpatrick translation of this anyway mainly interested because the cover is great    if its bad im probably going to get the hollander ones
  i have your pic related and it is a pretty decent translation id go as far to recommend it over hollander
get the allen mandelbaum one instead
its a pretty decent translation and is relatively easy to follow for contemporary readers but i feel he butchers the names of the malebranche eg barbariccia  twirlitufts cagnazzo  baddog and the malebolge rottenpockets which would be fine except he keeps the classical names for most other things intros good at giving context as well if youre new id say well worth the read regardless of translation
do you do straussian readings
leo is tricky    strauss was a great fan of american television gunsmoke was his great favorite and he would hurry home from the seminar which would end at you know 530 or so and have a quick dinner so he could be at his seat before the television set when gunsmoke came on and he felt that this was good this show this had a salutary effect on the american public because it showed the conflict between good and evil in a way that would be immediately intelligible to everyone    bad man on gunsmoke lets see what happens    james arness no  shoots bad man bad man drops to the ground     rosen the hero has a white hat hes faster on the draw than the bad man the good guy wins and its not just that the good guy wins but that values are clear thats america were gonna triumph over the evils of of that are trying to destroy us and the virtues of the western frontier good and evil    vo leo strauss other favorite program was perry mason and this he told his students epitomized the role that they the élite had to play in public they should promote the myths necessary to rescue america from decay but in private they didnt have to believe in them    rosen perry mason was different from gunsmoke the extremely cunning man who as far as we can see is very virtuous and uses his great intelligence and quickness of mind to rescue his clients from dangers but who could be fooling usbecause hes cleverer than we are is he really telling the truth maybe his client is guilty    leo is tricky
    ive been know to do straussian readings of xenophon
nah he influenced the neocons bill kristol etc who proved themeselves to be inadequate when they were in power thus strauss is inadequate    i suppose you could read him as a historical artefact of the history of western thought much like marx
  strauss a rabbitlike man hit upon a pedagogical technique while he was bouncing around teaching jobs before landing at the u of c  he simply told u of c students they were philosopherkings who alone could access the hidden meaning that persecuted philosophers such as socrates hid from the hoi polloi
  yes allan bloom claimed strauss had another esoteric teaching that he only shared with jewish students  no neocon has ever apologized for the disaster they foisted upon usa and uk
  allan bloom and the newcons are tricksters  take blooms closing you picture a curmudgeonly prof who believed in the bible and the great books no matter what fads had taken over the university  it was all an act  bloom was a queen who died of the aids outbreak and was borrowing 500 from saul bellow for prostitutes even though he was dying of aids bellow outed him in ravelstein  he didnt believe in god  according to him he lived what strauss taught
is this the shitpost general
natural right and history is undoubting his masterpiece also his lectures on nietzsches zarathustra are great check his notes on carl schmitt too i am currently reading his fragments on the political philosophy of hobbes
  he influenced the neocons bill kristol etc who proved themeselves to be inadequate when they were in power thus strauss is inadequate  bill kristol is much different and much less capable than his father and true neocon irving kristol neoconservatism was originally something much different than w bushs presidency
  i wouldnt consider myself a straussian but his works are definitely worth seriously engaging with his highlighting of the tension between athens and jerusalem and the varying forms in which such a tension manifests throughout history is probably one of the most insightful contributions to political philosophy of the last century      where did he say this
  ravelstein  strauss and bloom were the opposite of mortimer adler they all taught at the same university knew each other and couldnt have disagreed more  id take adlers revised onebook syntopicon over two tricksters
  a prime example of jewish exegetical autism    thats a compliment btw
  this is a stupid fucking post     also this one    top notch troll    i love stanley rosen and hadnt encountered this before sincerely thank you
whats the difference between an east and west coast straussian
  how is strauss shitposting
  strauss had a picture of a rabbit in his office and would have raised giant flemish rabbits if hed had his way he was a scared rabbit  whats up doc
  harry jaffa is west coast  allan bloom is east coast  those were the leaders
  looking at a list of noticeable faculty makes uchicago seem like the weirdest place
  west coast straussians believe the east coast to be too dogmatically certain that atheism is true  allan bloom was an atheist and said this was the secret teaching strauss only felt comfortable sharing with jewish students  ravelstein portrays bloom as the ultimate atheist he took atheism to new highs or lows
  robert maynard hutchins hired both strauss and mortimer adler  the hutchins years  if hutchins werent president no way either gets hired
    it was all an act    not just an act but also a quintessence of strauss philosophy or the aspect which was appropriated and extensively used by neoconservatives  which is  you have to constantly remind the plebs about moral virtues rules about holy bible and the struggle of good vs bad  but it was only meant for the masses neocons themselves believed that leaders of society are exempt from all these rules  different standards for different classes
you mean thinking there is a secret gnosis behind every text hidden to keep the plebs ignorant and that plato wrote all that shit with you in mind
you can take strauss courses for free on the uchicago website there are audio recordings of the lectures and transcriptions of the lectures     strauss is quite interesting but his epigones are less so i took classes with some famous straussians at uchicago and they are impressive readers but they go down rabbit holes of their own design its just a political scientist on amphetamines much more impressive analytical depth but founded on feet of clay bad assumptions anachronism etc    strauss himself escapes most of these problems and is the most intriguing because he has a keen historical sense and even more so a deep deep sense of the zeitgeist of his youth upon which the postmodern crisis is founded when he commits an anachronism its for a reason its selfconscious and its interesting when thirdrate political theologian 2184 does it in 2017 its mostly to larp as an edgy straussian putting the cart before the horse to be honest     the worst are the students who think of themselves straussians or straussian initiates because they think its a secret club     gottfrieds book is good drurys work is worth reading
also check out heinrich meiers books for further insight
  strauss is quite interesting but his epigones are less so    catherine zuckert is pretty good she handles plato in a sophisticated systematic fashion
  rockefeller gave them a shit load of money and they had no strong ties to the coasts
  what are other examples
wew a good thread on lit what the fuck senpaitachi
  most ideas people are academic nomads
why do americans insist this is a good book     is it because the author is gay
why do europeans insist that their literary works are superior to american ones
  it is    they are
rent free lol
  why do you think it isnt    walt whitman is arguably the quintessential american poet no one more embodies the idealized melting pot than he does not just americans revere him either considering that when wilde came to america he made good mind to pay walt a visit    
  what do you think wilde a shitty anglo playwrite and known homosexual did when he came to america to see whitman a shitty anglo poet and known homosexual    let me spell it out for you they played hide the pickle
borges loved whitman
  not even european but they are
  he liked some works by him he didnt love him
  they probably did fuck yes but wilde was a young man at this point and whitman had long since started greyingits highly unlikely he came to visit him just to fuck when he could have found any number of more suiting yet still willing participants he singled whitman out because of his poetry the sex is just an added benefit
  imagine wilde sticking his dick between whitmans wrinkled buttcheeks whitman wheezing with pleasure the whole time    it would probably be like sticking your dick between two large warm raisins
  wilde was bottom
  imagine the smell
  but what kind
  a 6 8 bottom  yeah right  but rimbaud was a top
  the guy in my state senate who keeps trying to eminent domain my ancestral home is a 65 power bottom jew never underestimate lanklets

blood meridian by cormac mccarthy is a book that has been on my toread for a very long time finally i picked it up at the library  no its not because i recently played red dead redemption 2 i havent  and was excited to start it which today i did wow i spent a good hour trying to read the first 15 or 20 pages i had to keep going back to reread passages multiple times to understand what was going on it was a good 20 minutes before i realized there was actually dialogue between characters occurring as opposed to some weird inner or narrator dialogue because there were no quotation marks hell no apostrophes or few commas    maybe im not terribly intelligent despite my years of schooling but i am struggling with this book more so than i can recall ever struggling with any other fiction novel am i missing something i really want to read this book but i cannot seem to break through his writing style    can someone help me out here any tips am i approaching his writing from the wrong perspective or should i give up and stick to john grisham novels as an aside i hate john grisham
  i mean this is the kind of book where you need to be conscious about what youre reading you need to be awake its not a book for drones m8 its sort of like a game like that cortázar story miss cora all you need to do is to make sense of what youre actually reading not just going automatically like youre reading a newspaper i also had my issues with it at first but i ended up liking it its a book for active readers
  he has an unusually terse style it takes some getting used to but his imagery is second to none read this shit and tell me you cant imagine exactly what it looks like its like looking at a painting except in words
i got 300 pages in and gave up on it i understand what hes doing but fuck its dull no one not even the kid has anything resembling a personality its just they go somewhere something terrible happens then go somewhere else on repeat i didnt finish it so maybe all the good stuff is in the second half maybe ill give it another try eventually i dunno
  if you dont want to spend a lot of time reading and rereading to parse the plot you need to dabble in some modernist literature
  as far as difficulty mccarthy is like a discount faulkner
  its only 350 pages why wouldnt you just finish it
  cormac is like a mystical faulkner
youre just not used to it thats ok its a pretty tough work and theres a lot of repetition     its also really reference heavy and hes trying to write it like the old testament in style so give it a go with that in mind
  i bought the ebook and it said it was 600 pages ebooks page numbers change depending on your text size either way i got half way through and said fuck it now im reading slaughterhouse five
  faulkner had a much more digressive style along with neverending runon sentences mccarthy has the opposite problem he uses a lot of short descriptive sentences juxtaposed together making it hard to see if youre not following it closely
    he uses a ton of run ons in blood meridian iirc
    im only about 40 of the way through it but what the fuck if youve stuck through the prose this far how can you quit now         prose is like painting and especially with mccarthy you either like it or dont    read a little bit about his ethos and self imposed writing rules sometimes he has very big things happen in very sparse detail youre really supposed to chew slowly on the prose
    was always my favorite graph in the road    thanks anon
    they have completely different writing styles you have no idea what youre talking about
  takes time to get used to his style but when you do it goes faster   youll eventually get a handle on the dialog thing once you know he doesnt use quotes youll be alert to it   for understanding events hes a very visual writer and sometimes just describes how something looks without saying what it is so try to really draw a mental picture   also know that not every scene or chapter is of critical plot importance a huge amount is ambiance repeating motifs references and so on  i didnt finish it on my first or second attempt on my third it really clicked
  i got 300 pages in and gave up on it  so this is /lit/
  he uses a few that everyone remembers like the page long description of the apache war band but in general theres variety like in that example above from the road yellow leaves full sentence
  hes like faulkner but with stories you actually give a shit about
ah blood meridian monsieur
  actually reading  thats isnt /lit/
i literally just gave it a shot myself and remembered why i dont like his novels read the road but gave up of bm about a quarter of the way through he just vomits his mind on paper plot dialogue and all cant stand it
  blood meridian has a really weird plot for sure the main character is in the background for like the middle 75 of the book is the plot killing it for you or more the style
  return this book to the library asap and move on to something worthwhile life is too short for this drivel i made it to  65 and quit believe me i tried
corncob tortilla yecarthy  shiggydiggy
  are you retarded have you read both of them faulkners influence on mccarthy is extremely obvious and has been so from his first novel
  i was actually planning on picking that up tomorrow funny enough mostly thanks to a /k/ recommendation thread seems like it might be neat
  op try reading other cormac mccarthy books first blood meridian really is jumping in at the deep end    if youre new to mccarthy his lack of punctuation and prose can sometimes be daunting but if you start with books like the road no country for old men outer dark or child of god child of god might not be the best place to start but its where i started with him and it had me hooked youll get used to him pretty quickly    try blood meridian after that but also keep in mind its an ambiguous slow burner that focuses a lot on the desolation and sparsity of the old west with a lot of character actions and motivations being questionable and unusual especially the judge and the man at the end its often a heavily debated book often regarded as a classic so if you still struggle to understand it then thats all fine just make sure that if you finish it to try and look into some information on the book to help further your understanding im about prepped for my second read of blood meridian
   gave up 300 pages into a book thats only 330 pages    what was anons end game here
  durr it dont get it  it must be bad
  start with his two worst books  okay
  whichever books you consider his two worst are also likely to be two of his most accessible and a bad cormac mccarthy book is still better than most of the contemporary literature out there nowadays in my opinion     you could contribute more than just contrarianism were not going anywhere
  im with you op i cant read this book  the writing style is horrible plus the storyline is pretty boring
  dumbass lol
i found the style to be incredibly beautiful to be honest famalams
  wrongamundo peabrain    gang horses their way across texmex   describe cacti and rocks and sky and earth using 40 pages  kill some native injuns or spics brutally  describe cacti and rocks and sky and earth using 40 pages  find some native injuns or spics hung upside down mutilated and brutally murdered  describe cacti and rocks and sky and earth using 40 pages  find some native injuns or spics etc    lather rinse repeat
  thanks for posting solid content     read slowly limit any distractions ear plugs pomodoro journal as you read thats helped me exponentially
  prose is like painting and especially with mccarthy you either like it or dont  i respectfully disagree with a handful of exceptions i thought that prose that did more than just say what was happening was unnecessary until i read lolita
any esls in here is this even penetrable for a non native speaker
can people post more screencapped highlights from the book
ah the daily blood meridian thread this place never fucking changes
  more  that highlighted passage in  isnt from blood meridian
  pa why are eggs breakfast    what     you can put bacon on lunch     ye    but if you put eggs on stuff it becomes breakfast    the man spat and said the eggs are not for this world or from this world they come from the chicken but the chicken knows it not    he wiped his chin and spat
    dont forget the tortillas and beans
  if your native language is spanish then yes
  they wandered the borderland for weeks seeking some sign of the apache deployed upon that plain they moved in a constant elision ordained agents of the actual dividing out the world which they encountered and leaving what had been and what would never be alike extinguished on the ground behind them spectre horsemen pale with dust anonymous in the crenellated heat above all else they appeared wholly at venture primal provisional devoid of order like beings provoked out of the absolute rock and set nameless and at no remove from their own loomings to wander ravenous and doomed and mute as gorgons shambling the brutal wastes of gondwanaland in a time before nomenclature was and each was all
  mccarthy is far better than faulkner we just dont recognize him as such because faulkner came first
  embarrassing purpleprose tripe stuffed with indulgent macho themes
you will love this book if you want to hear a rocky desert explained for 100 pages
  i understand exactly what youre talking about  reading the story for the first time took me a long time  but when i reread it i was shocked by how vividly the scenes of the story laid themselves out in my mind id describe it as cinematic only better  as bloom has said the second reading is more important than the first
  theyre not bad theyre just way more accessible than bm
  bloom gave up on it twice it was the third reading that he broke through
  first chapter in doesnt seem too bad honestly sometimes certain lines require a reread but it seems pretty easy to get through without getting completely lost if youre just paying attention  does it get worse later on
  nope certain lines needing to be reread is really as bad as it gets i think a lot of people on /lit/ just jump into it because its talked about so much here and it does have a particular omnipotent impersonal voice and near lack of plot that combined with such stylized prose probably just dazzles and/or discourages people new to literature
  embarrassing
  giving up on a book  i shiggy diggy  ill admit ive read a few books that had me completely lost most of the time but i still powered through them it feels weird to just stop a book halfway through
  style i was hoping to get into the plot which i was just his style is overbearing
  slaughterhouse five  try reading some reddit posts they seem to be more your speed
  youre not alone in finding something written with punctuational minimalism hard to follow i think anything that has to be reread more than twice is completely unnecessary its funny because in interviews im pretty sure he said it was to make it less cluttered and an easier read but it just became the complete opposite i do agree that eventually it becomes readable once you get used to the style but its a completely useless style and a waste of time getting used to it as not many books are written like this anyways i gave up halfway through because of this
what the fuck was holdens problem
i loved the road and hated blood meridian anyone else
  op unironically from the way you write you seem like a lovely person merry xmas mate
  i gave up on mccarthy after the road then i read blood meridian and it changed my mind
  more liek what the fuck was glantons problem    boo hoo i cant see my wife and kids anymore so let me go butcherscalp every random mexican i come across
  glanton did nothing wrong
i felt this same way with the sun also rises and that book wasnt even long plus it had legible punctuation i just couldnt grasp it enough reading 1 page took me like 20 minutes not to mention a wtf plot sucks to find this out because i planned on reading this book next after what im reading now still its better to know what im in for i suppose
  find an audiobook theres absolutely no shame in listening to mccarthy rather than reading him
  glanton did some fucked up things chief among them was probably whatever his deal with holden was and tolerating holdens and later the niggers blatant pedophilia his campaign against the indians did make sense he kind of just went crazy after awhile
  and later the niggers  
  the road was written for the oprah audience
  after theyve taken over the ferry young girls are kept tied up to leashes naked glanton passes one outside the niggers dwelling this may be why holden had such an interest in him throughout holden clearly has a thing for raping and killing kids throughout the book too also wtf is holden
  shits weird im not well read but i picked up on everything almost immediately didnt know people were having trouble
  contrary to popular belief theres no real set kind of person who will get something a very well read man whose gone over and analyzed all the classics in meticulous detail can not get a certain book while someone whos much more of a casual reader will get it on their first read and vice versa  this stuff varies from person to person its not really an objective thing
nothing great or important has been written in over a decade now the tradition is over     prove me wrong
i cant youre right
  i dont personally know any examples therefore it doesnt exist  i havent listened to a contemporary album for over a decade i conclude that music is dead
  album  judging the state of music by the state of popular music
wow a decade literature truly is dead as is opie because apparently he is a bug with a life span of 30 years
  a decade  lol more like three decades     honestly if youre only a reader this isnt really a problem since theres already more good stuff written than you can read in one lifetime but anyone trying to write books in 2018 is completely wasting their time
  so you concede im right then
  i concede my interest in this thread
  music is alive and well but full length albums are a dead format similarly there is plenty of stuff being written its just that books have become obsolete
  can a book be great without being important also im betting your standards for important are quite arbitrary
youre wrong and ive no need to prove you wrong because it is obvious  if youre posting evangelion spurdo memes as an op image then im not sure who you expect to be taken seriously by anyway  i hate these threads
pale king was 2011 you mongrel
  the tradition is over  lold at that for some reason
  how do you know when a book is great or important dont you have to wait for proof of time
  it agrees with his worldview  thats
  no
  and yet
i dont read anything nor even try to look  there is great writing going on all the time as long as human beings write there will be great and important work done you are accustomed to being spoonfed all of humankinds achievements over the last 4000 years within the 8 years of reading in high school and college just because that rate does not continue and no one is spoonfeeding you with a syllabus complete with analysis and unpacking of allusions and context from your teacher and secondary material does not mean literature is dead    rambhadracharyas epic poems thats all im going to mention there are others but your pretentious shit attitude deserves even less than the one i gave
  no because part of the tradition itself is the cultural significance its over
  can only offer up second rate work by a literally who  accuses others of being pretentious     literature really must be dead
  by this definition literature becomes subcultural based on this we can conclude that it is not the primary engine of culture but it is heavily influential to some many of whom make up the greater culture  if this is the case then literature is still important to culture as a whole
  the point  you
  its about as influential as opera
  demonstrably false kafka burned most of his writing while he was alive what we have now is only what his friend decided to share with the world against kafkas dying wishes keats died at the age of 25 believing he was a failure his poems were not received well at the time by critics dickinson published only ten poems her whole fucking life and also died in obscurity kennedy toole was only discovered after his mom got it published after he died melville also went to the grave believing he was a failure he sold only about 3200 copies of moby dick during his life here are others but those are among the more famous cases     speaking of melville hawthorned wrote to melville once complaining that the bestselling books were all sentimental trash written by scribbling women that was 150 years ago and yet look at what was written since then that however much it did not crack the nyt bestseller list has taken a permanent place on high school syllabi across the anglophone world tif youre the same guy as op i am going to reiterate shit attitude pretentious and on top of that youre a pseud log off 4chan and start fucking reading you godless crank
  second rate work  you clearly didnt even bother to look into him they are epic poems with multiple varieties of meter and rhyme densely allusive his work synthesizes six traditional types of literature and some sections revive a 2000 year old style among other things    by a literally who  oh so it has to be a name you already know for it to possibly be good im fucking done here your aesthetic dehydration is as selfimposed as it is deserved
  damn that guy was blinded at two months old and memorized the entire fucking gita at the age of five now i really feel useless

  thats just not true opera lacks relevance partially because of its steep fee to entry books on the other hand are quite cheap you would be surprised how many people are directly affected by literature
tfw you realize there will never be a great american novel in your lifetime
  music is dead though     poetry novels music  millennials continue to kill art by putting zero effort into producing more
  bestselling books were all sentimental trash written by scribbling women    war war never changes
  tfw you wont write the great american novel
  ahem
there are no good contemporary write
  its dead but that doesnt mean it can  t come back
this meme is overrated there was some good stuff but overall the 18th c was slow for literature  few or no goat poets a few good novels but little compared to the 19th c things seem slow but it will take another 100 years at least to tell if the decline is terminal
  only time can tell moby dick was forgotten and only rediscovered like 60 years after it was published
  but full length albums are a dead format  id say that the situation is the opposite considering the revival of vinyl      year 110  nothing great or important has been written in over a decade now the tradition is over   prove me wrong    year 800  nothing great or important has been written in over a century now the tradition is over   prove me wrong    year 1700  nothing great or important has been written in over a decade now the tradition is over   prove me wrong
  old  good  new  bad
  are you 12 years old anon
  this right here not to mention you cant decide what is important in your own time needs historical context hindsight or the measure of the influence of the work
even if nothing great was written in the past decade how does that show that the tradition is over you are implying that there has never been a point in literary history where a decade went by without a great work being written which is another absurd claim
lives in the age with highest level of literacy and most amount of people reading books daily  hurr bewks r ded
what about knausgaard or that guy in australia whos like 80 and has never left his town murnary or something
90 of this board never reads anything released in the last 50 years yet will boldly claim that its because nothing great was written ability to think critically is something denizens of /lit/ are yet to evolve
  blood meridian for the oprah audience  no
  a large number of people on this board have read 2666 and submission both of which were released in the last 20 years
  whoa it keeps happening
  its not a matter of good books being undiscovered or unwritten as there are plenty its a matter of us being in a position where people simply dont read or discuss literature anymore similar to before we had the printing press theres just too many competing options for entertainment no reason to be so nasty
  it would probably be better if even less people read make the club a little bit more exclusive that way the masses dont spread their tendrils and ruin my hobby
  just because nothing popular or world known of substance is written doesnt mean smaller authors arent publishing quality books retard
    screen arts are literature they all started out as a script
    nathan hill  the nix  jonathan franzen  purity  thomas pynchon  bleeding edge
  screen arts are literature    but as in literature the vast majority of movies are trash
  while i understand the logic behind this especially in the age of hyper sensitivity and censure id like to discuss books with other people it hardly ever happens
  it is true operas lack of relevance has very little to do with how much it costs   the steep prices are necessary to its survival if it was cheaper the whole industry would go under because demand is so low pulp fiction and self help are the things that are keeping the publishing industry afloat    rates of reading are plummeting and will continue to do so until it joins the likes of opera and ballet as exclusive habits of the middle class pseud
  your shit self published novel isnt quality anything your pathetic cunt
  what happened in your childhood that made you such a hipster pseud
  do you know youll be dying tomorrow
  implying anyone really cares about this besides english teachers or newspaper writers    but i agree our generation will end up more voiceless than previous ones    waitin for that societal collapse
trips and genz saves art for all humanity

there hasnt been any writing to ops standard in the past decade  literature_is_deadbanic  what were the dark ages
  if i get dubs literature confirmed to be dead
  its funny how despite our ability to be heard is greater than it has ever been before we have used it to say nothing of lasting value    well nothing that we know of at least its hard to say what has lasting value at this point in time since we cant see the aftereffects yet
  an unfinished novel by a 90s literary icon (((published))) several years after he an heroed    maybe if hed actually completed the thing and it had been good you would have a point
  unfinished masterpiece tier questionable      poetry in translation tier no idea      mixed bag havent read them all but thats a bad murakami and the saadawi is a failure      not my favourite mcc but fair answer      rates of reading are plummeting  although book sales manage to consistently climb
  cringe
  this alcoholic goblin is literally the only one
  the underground railroad was only soso
  literature was dead in the dark ages     literature is dead now    both these things are correct literature can be reborn but it will take a huge change in culture as one technology gave literature eminence printing press another set of technologies the one two three punch of film television and the internet have taken it away there is no telling what the future holds but for now the book is closed
  although book sales manage to consistently climb  ask yourself what theyre buying
  epic poems with multiple varieties of meter and rhyme densely allusive his work synthesizes six traditional types of literature and some sections revive a 2000 year old style among other things    sounds epically dull and academic wanking hiyo
  but for now the book is closed    soumission was published 3 years ago on the same day as the charlie hebdo attack this book is as or more culturally relevant than any other piece of art produce in the last 3 years

the greatest comic ever written any books like it    also one thing i loved about both this and the homeric epics is the kings ruling small kingdoms the sovereign still leads his men into battle and is forced to take personal responsibility for the day to day affairs of state he has a personal connection with the community he rules any books set in times/worlds like this

  its miyazakis opus and quite literally a masterpiece give it a read if you have the time
  i dont really like this kind of stuff but you have cought my attention where can i read it is there any free version or should absolutly buy it
    i read it online the first time but years later now that i have some disposable income i went out and bought the whole box set obviously reading the physical copy will do the art more justice but you can find the whole thing on some online manga reader site
  one thing i loved about both this and the homeric epics is the kings ruling small kingdoms the sovereign still leads his men into battle and is forced to take personal responsibility for the day to day affairs of state he has a personal connection with the community he rules  it baffles me what sort of banalities people can enjoy in art
  this illustration makes it waaaayyyy more clear than in the anime that shes wearing earthtoned leggings under her skirt and not running around an nbc environment with no panties on
  watch the film its by far more famous than the manga
    the manga is far better the film only covers the first two volumes and leaves out most of the philosophy if the guy is already on /lit/ then he wont mind reading it
  kanji too difficult no way i dont do translated literature/film

dear /lit/    what is the purpose of purpose
  what is the purpose of the purpose of purpose
  how can we know without answering what the purpose of purpose is
  seems self evident to me
porpoise puns
  to serve fulfillment
  then what is it
  purpose is its own purpose
  unless you just gave yourself a you that anon is not you and so what is evident to anons self will be different than what is evident to your anonymous self as you are not that anon in particular and so cannot share in anons particular self evidence
  what is purpose
telos
  has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like
  english was a mistake
its a skinner box
  ha cualquiera en verdad sido tan lejos aun como decidido a usar aun ir quiere hacer parece más así
  the reason for doing something the aim to which an action is directed
to propose a universal catagory for an indeterminate esse in futūro whos becomeing is determined by that proposition when it becomes
  this means that purpose is a nomological habit operating according to the rules of inference
    i like it but does that make purpose arbitrary
  fuck off and die filthy hegelian    its a dialectic
1 phenomena signs words and symbols do not have inherent significance  2 these only have the significance or value they are given  3 the unique power of the subjective mind is to attribute significance to things  4 the meaning of existence is in the value of subjectivity whatever this may be  5 by 2 the value of subjectivity must be given and the subject can give it whatever significance he wishes  6 the proper starting place is to assign subjectivity the greatest possible significance  6a to give subjectivity the least possible significance is logically inconsistent as the subjective valueassignment of subjectivity as nil implicitly assumes the value of subjectivity in making the assignment a contradiction  7 that is the proper starting place is to consider the meaning of existence to be found in the perfect or in other words god  7a this is no proof of god but a demonstration that the idea of god is where man should begin his reflections
  actually im a peirceian hegel doesnt have enough secondness and peirces triadism does everything hegels does and more unlike hegel peirces phenomenonology and metaphysics are philosophically tenable    not at all what it does is make is make purpose real through the reality of universals those propositional catagories that determine the being of that indeterminate esse in futūro i mentioned earlier
  actually im a peirceian hegel doesnt have enough secondness and peirces triadism does everything hegels does and more unlike hegel peirces phenomenonology and metaphysics are philosophically tenable  instead of being magical thinking and retardation squared i decided to cube it  whats a level below scribbler
  not only does it make thirdnessor purpose if you wish but that doesnt fully capture the reality of thirdness real it leaves thirdness as the thing that animates the continuous movement of reality and makes thirdness the phenemonological representation of reality but representation requires more than just thirdness here is where terrance deacon comes in to develop peirceian ideas further with his catagory of ententional phenomena and their origin and existence in absence with this we see that the apprehension of thirdness has its origins in an animatedmy word system that has an empty space for thirdness to live in thus an animated system that can experience what is purposed in thirdness this i say is what where the reality of thirdness becomes living i say the metaphysical nature of life is as the space where living happens
  yep you cant even understand hegel
dear diary    what is porpoise     love jimmy
  i was reading something in the standford encyclopedia of philosophists about some analytic metaphysics it was somewhere in the location and mereology or plural quantification i think but i dont remember as i was very high spinning around could be anywhere and prehaps it was in a journal it was about someone who wrote about the mind as existing in context it sounds very similar to what peirce says about mind existing in the mind of naturei dont think this can be properly interperted as a kind of panpsychism and that thinking is the process of paying attention to certain parts of the continuous development of the reality of thirdness represented in signs that semiotic reality is what i like to call the reality of living thirdness   does anyone know where this radical contextual substantivalism comes from im very interested in studying analytic metaphysics with peirceian semiotics
  this would be infinite regress that is why the search for purpose is ultimately fruitless
  har någon verkligen varit långt ens bestämt sig för att använda ens gå vilja göra se ut som
suicide because contemplation caused by perpetual despair is disease
  there is no porpoise
  thats because hegel doesnt make sense in his metaphysics his politics at least were reasonably on point where they werent bootlicking
is this a good writing desk   i currently just use a freebie i found on craigslist but its terrible and falling apart  also what would be a good chair to pair with it
the only reason this board doesnt talk more about faulkner is that it has like all other 4chan boards latent issues with race you know its true this board loves joyce and pynchon but ignores faulkner the ultimate american modernist in the end those of you who are averse to his subject matter are just missing out on an incredible author
based i actually think most people here like faulkner however
  yeah they do and half the ones that claim to dislike him are just doing it to post that nabby quote
  i think most of us recognize that faulkner is way more complex than white people bad or black people bad that said i havent really seen any dislike of faulkner and he comes up pretty frequently here
  definitely     faulkner is basically opaque may not have had an explicit intent in his fiction at all
  this goes way over my head im sorry whats the race connection here not familiar with faulkner i just know that hes often considered one of the great american authors
faulkner is at least worthy of being studied hemingway is a goon and i hate reading about his languid characters in middleschool prose
  he wrote about slavery a lot
  yeah thats one of the things i love about him he doesnt feel the need to come out and beat you over the head with an overt message     he presents his own fictional stories almost objectively and makes you genuinely think hard about how you feel about them
        i agree he is not disliked thats not what i meant my mistake if it came off that way given the value intellectualism has here i dont think anyone from this board who has read could dislike him proper    i think he is ignored rather and left out of the litmemeauthors discussion like joyce and pynchon because of his everpresent discussion on slavery in the same way someone like woolf might also be left out you see posts on jordan peterson and altright stuff every so often which is perfectly fine people can talk about whatever they want and that indicates me that as much as we would perhaps like to believe otherwise theres still a contingent of that unintelligent 4chan anger on lit    i love faulkner obviously and think he is just as sophisticated and intellectual as all the other authors lit drools over in addition to being obviously very cannon i think he puts some people here off however with his open visceral speech on white sins which leaves him out of this circle of authors lit drools over
  i agree no need to efface yourself  it was my mistake to conflate not discussed with not liked quality thread
  i think your problem is more with internet culture in general and less political i agree that itd be nice to see more serious threads about faulkner and others but this is 4chan and meme/b8 threads about peterson and rupi are just part of the experience
  right you are right i dont particularly find that subculture interesting and thats part of my issue but to me some of the same people who participate in that culture also participate in the nonshitpost lit threads and it certainly has to affect the apprehension of some works by the groupthink to some degree    like i browse this board a lot yet i rarely see threads on very good authors who fall into more politicized perspectives adopted by the left especially in academia ive never seen a thread on byatt szimborska or even ferrante for example who are great and extremely relevant authors beyond the scope politics part of our role as reader and while were at it critic to some extent as most of us here have intellectual baggage to not only read but criticize is to project ourselves into otherness and other voices even ones we are unsympathetic toward
  youre from reddit
heard faulkner talk for the first time today kind of surprised me  
can someone recommend me some literature regarding the economics of the european union preferably something with a pessimistic outlook    no german propopaganda please

  no fap is pointless anyway brother    but heres a tip as someone whos done 3 months once you get through the first wave of extreme hornyness your sex drive levels out and its way easier its just that first 12 week window when you are in a state of unimaginable hornyness that its hard after that you just feel normal with occasional boats of mild hornyness    with that said no fap is not healthy because youre just swapping out one extreme for another no porn is the true red pill

  this is the problem with the education system in modern society there are thousands upon thousands of young men guideless leaderless and adrift this wouldnt be the case if we lived in independent polises where an older erastes could teach a young eromenos like the one we have here about practical life skills poetry literature and art instead we have a broken education system that by trying to cater to everyone reaches nobody on an individual level and the gap is filled by meaningless self help books and internet celebrities
  the purpose of generalised education is to cater to many different people who will later move towards a specific field    the problem with the education system is lack of support at home consistently parental support for learning matters beyond anything else just look at the us where nigger schools keep getting more funding but their horrific grades stay the same while asians at these same schools do above national average
  my parents are the ones who pushed me to go to college i think i wouldnt mind a simple wage slave while i do my creative work in my free time desu
  you need a college degree to get a decent wage slave job
my diary desu
  the purpose of generalised education is to cater to many different people who will later move towards a specific field  and this is the problem most people under 20 ive met cant even write a check they learn nothing of practical skills and know nothing of the arts the role of a parent can only do so much with educating a youth especially once they are of the age trying to be separate from them an independent tutor from outside of the family à la aristotle and alexander is the best education a young person can have college and primary school geared for this mythical general student cannot compare to it
  which is why i want to fucking kill myself sometimes im this lazy fuck that can only work hard on my creative interests
  people dont use cheques anymore your concept of what practical skills are is probably moronic  art is a load of shit for pseudointellectuals   parents can organise private tutors seems more of a component of greater parental support for education
  read the great shark hunt bud
  the problem with the education system is that it is completely subservient to the labor economy people from birth are groomed into systems they never even agreed to participate in    the education system should be a catalyst to what society ought to be not a labor factory
  yeah man were taught from kindergarden to obey and shut up or else were punished

  the horror of that library is the library itself because it is absolutely absurd it is of no use to us it may as well never exist at all
  can someone explain the library of babel to me please
  its a library that has basically everything its useless because its mostly junk read the borges story its short
  have you read the story its short and entertaining its basically about a guy who writes about a library with too much books with specific characteristics in an equally monotous library made of hexagonal rooms and tons of floors and stairs the library has all the variations in the combinations of 23 letters a space a coma and a dot so there could be anything written in these books lots of uninteresting and random things like irrational succesions of letters but also a catalog of all the books in the library a book about the purpose of the library a book predicting the particular future of its reader and their counterparts books denying what is purpotted in these last books i mentioned so in the end the library is actually useless and a sort of monstrosity for humanity because we abhor infinity or something like that
  read the fucking story nigger its like 5 pages long
  i wish i could kill you desu
give the the sequel to the karamazov brothers
  probably op
is library of babel the statement on the limits of human language or human creativity because if you believe in the infinite nature of human imagination the library should theoretically contain an infinitely running story spaced in an infinite number of tomes however this is clearly impossible since the library has finite number of books
itt books that youve put down and wont be picking back up for the foreseeable future
  im reading chapter iii why did you give up
difficulties with the language op
  read 150 pages or so probably gonna donate it to a bookstore
  you should donate it to a public library
this shit here maybe it makes me an idiot but fuck me of this shit isnt hard to follow im not sure whos talking whos thinking or if theyre actually talking out loud or thinking in the first place or if theyll ever get to the lighthouse or just think and talk about how nice it would be to go ive tried four times to read this shit over the past two years
  the bookstore im talking about is where i dump all the books that im done reading or that i think are shit its a charity and they sell it for really cheap
  its a great book why dont you like it
  i had to stop at the beginning of chapter 6 or 7 not becausei did not like it but because a jew requested a loan out of the library and my date extension was denied
    i stopped around 200 pages because i got bored of reading 2 page long descriptions of landscapes and battles the language is really beautiful but i just wanted the plot to hurry the fuck up and move along i also didnt find the judge as captivating as other /lit/ posters hyped up him up to be am i a pleb is the ending worth trudging through the rest of the book
  i found it uninteresting and uninsightful but of course i didnt read it in its entirety
  is the ending worth trudging through the rest of the book  yes
mario puzos the godfather
complete works of aristotle  so fucking long so fucking dry
  how many times can one man use the word and
  i also quit this    just felt pointless reading a comic novel desu
  reading for plot  yikes
  i am currently reading now page 150 i want to punch myself in the dick every time he goes on and on about mesas aloes pueblas and the sun     i unironically find nearly everything the judge says to be engrossing and its what keeps me going
  puebla is a mexican state m8
  if youre not enjoying the book then you should not read it its about the journey not the end i dont understand how a book can be worth it for the ending
  also i want to add that a lot of the literary intelligentsia in their 60s felt the books violence was too much many people in their early twenties that grew up seeing gore threads on 4chan are largely desensitized to violence so much so that i couldnt understand how someone could be so appalled by the gore in the book that they had to put it down
the first 400 pages were great the minimalist descriptions of him having a mental breakdown due to the release of the novel was amazing to read around page 450 the essay on hitler starts except the issue is that only around 50 pages are on hitler the other 600 pages just fucking jump around like crazy from paul celan to borges its all so disorienting hell talk about one poem or subject for a page and then jump to something else midsentence   he originally planned on making the last novel about how his marriage was falling apart but his podunk norwegian publisher said that was unreadable there was nothing on the page so he went back and rewrote it but it was rejected over and over again i feel like he just fucking gave up and decided to make it all philosophical just to placate his publishers  he should have just left the original draft because this is a terrible way to end the series i can see why fsg didnt publish this book while they published literally every other book in the series
  
count of monte cristo    it was cool but i got bored of it after the break out i didnt enjoy reading it and there were other things i was interested in
  is it not funny people have told me to read it
    i listened to a lecture from an ivy league literature professor about this book all she did was spot the references she didnt speak a single word about why these stories were relevant to the one being told    can someone point me towards some good literary analysis of any novel someone that has something interesting to say typing literary analysis into youtube gives you ceilingtofloor synopses
  the junipers though
  its been awhile since ive read it but im pretty sure the story doesnt go as far south as puebla i think anon meant pueblo but fuck if i know for mccarthys not shy of using archaic meaning of words instead of a words current common meaning
  maybe thats why i found the book so shocking i was never really into gore threads and always tried to avoid them and how mccarthy writes violence is incredibly vivid
seems like the entire book is condensed into the intro didnt read past the first few pages of ch1 too boring
  i didnt find it funny though its trying very hard to be
i just read bnw and its way more relevant and relatable why is orwell more famous than huxley
  because orwell wrote animal farm dumbass
  this  checked  based  redpilled also both his most famous works is way more memetastic than bnw
  because 1984 was used as anticommunist propaganda
because orwells dictatorships actually had reallife counterparts in the future whereas huxley worried about nothing
  holy shit you dont see the parallels between btw and now
  we dont have eugenics
  how about soma
  lol fucking fail faggot
  drugs are illegal in every country that matters
  because orwell wrote an accessible good vs bad novel with a love story  just what the plebs always crave huxley wrote a deeply considered philosophically interesting novel that predicted the future
  first genetically modified humans with resistance to a disease litterally born this month
  soma isnt about drugs its about the nihilistic hedonism that lives in our meaningless lifestyles
  well said
      can no see the symbolism of huxley fucking retards
the chad bnw vs the virgin 1984
why argue about these two books instead of the original and also superior pic related
  live
  instagram hook up culture is pure eugenics
  wuz
  superior  its some of the absolutely worst prose ever written truly the epitome of the interesting ideas no writing skills scifi meme
  3d cover glasses  lamo
  wyh argue about all three books when we all know that pale fire is the true superior
      i highly suggest reading island by huxley it makes you realize he is more of a retard than he seems from just reading brave new world        we has a much more interesting world but the writing blows definitely better than 1984 though
bnws world is interesting at first but its a really poorly written book neither are great but huxley is awful
  celled and interlinked fellow based 4channeller
  what is porn
  i like island
  is that a thing    im sorry i wouldnt know because i dont use instagram
  im sorry i wouldnt know because i dont use instagram  thats how we know youve already been excluded from the gene pool
  i have a pregnant wife
  and she has a secret
  because in america people are very afraid of big brother but not at all afraid of their free choices being bad for them brave new world shows peoples worst sides running the show but thats just efficiency no one has much problem medicating away their issues antidepressants medical marijuana etc or hooking up with strangers or centrally planning society politicians all run on plans economic and otherwise definitely very few people want to read or be scientists on the other hand if big brother came in and told people what to think all americans would hate it the difference is that brave new world is about what people would freely choose anyways while big brother is about being forced to choose something you dont want     big brother is objectively more terrifying
  i know if you catch my drift
in 1984 you are punished for noticing and trying to fight the oppression  in bnw you are prevented from birth from noticing
  agreed island had a solid message but boy was it hard to get through
  among
  what is abortion
  because orwell is one of the clearest english prose stylists of his time and his stuff is much more readable especially to plebs
  yes
  sounds like you havent read the book ever or decade old memoies of it     t just read brave new world for first time last month
    how is it bad prose the translation i read at least was good

  wissenschaftlicher quellentext  why does this feel a bit tongue in cheek
  because germany is so cucked that you are legally pohibited of printing an uncommentated read reee hitler so bad with a couple quotes out of context copy of mein kampf technically this copy is therefore illegal and my seller could go to prison putting wissenschaftlicher quellentext above it at least gives him the possibilit of getting a seler sentance because he did it for educational purposes but than again the seller doesnt really subscripe to pc thinking and makes fun of the people on his back regularly as you can read in pic related from another bad goy book copy      its really autism especially considering that you are allowed to buy original mein kamp copies and read it online
  as you can see obviously any body able to understand sarcasm will see no fucks given

how well do i have to be able to read german to be able to read hesse and kafka the last time i did german was for my gcse where i got a and im starting it again and things are coming back easily
kafka  alevel  hesse  university    its mostly a question of vocab as you probably covered the majority of grammar structures at gcse
phone always in need of charging so i cant keep it next to me while i read to look up new words i come across  dont have the memory to keep a running list of new words in my head to look up later  no paper to do it manually   guess ill stay a wordlet forever
  most people dont learn new words by memorising their definitions basically all of your knowledge including knowledge of words was gained through contextual understanding like nobody explained to you what greentext was you just learned how to use it through seeing it used
  shut the fuck up im not going to learn words like nictitation from context
  kindles have a built in dictionary
  you would if youd encounter it often that anon is right i am doing the same as you and i cant recall fuck all
tfw wordlet
  fuck you
if youre encountering dozens of words you dont understand in a single reading session then you are reading too far above your level if you cant remember 1020 words for a short amount of time then you might be retarded
so hogwarts abolished slytherin after the whole voldemort thing right
how do i into aristotle i want to understand him as well as possible
  study the organon
reading some plato is helpful given the amount of times he is referenced im not that deep in aristotle unfortunately but my experience so far tells me that reading some work from his teacher and making comparisons is the best way to go
  which works of plato should i read before getting into aristotle
  the republic is a definite and also meme tier
  its only meme tier because its mandatory reading in some schools and folks think finishing and understanding it is all you need to become a philosopher    start here go deeper
this but also for plato give me the most concise systematic study of them both
  i was told by a prof at my phil department to start with theaetetus and sophist and then read the 5 dialogues idk about after that tho
read his major works
  the republic is the cornerstone of western civilization much like the bible but unlike the holy bible not enough people know of its existence
  obviously you imbecile but in what order
  this fucking question    do as you please you fucking slave why are you so afraid of free will
you could start with the history of philosophy without gaps you can get the book or listen to the podcast the first volume ends with him and gives you a really nice context and an overall view of his philosophy its also a light read    i wouldnt recommend diving into his texts cold youre just gonna end up reading all of em a billion times remember people have dedicated their whole lives to those works but if youre up to it i wish you the best of luck in your trek if youre going to choose this path you definitely need to read some plato
  it really doesnt matter
  ethics
  organon categories de interpretatione prior and posterior analytics physics metaphysics de anima nicomachean ethics politics poetics rhetoric
  pray to one of the greek gods with his magic hell surely turn you into aristotle and youll able to see all his memories and understand him
  read his books  use secondary sources whenever you dont understand  use secondary sources even if you think that you are understanding
  read commentators in advance then read his work otherwise it is very likely that you will miss 80 of his content
rist mind of aristotle is a good bok
  crito meno the statesman for aristotles nicomachean ethics and politics gorgias protagoras euthydemus for aristotles organon and rhetoric phaedo theaetetus for aristotles on the soul parmenides timaeus for aristotles physics and metaphysics io symposium for aristotles poetics

  there are a ton of worthreading catholic authors a lot of christianity charts have sections for catholicism vs protestantism vs orthodoxy as well    pretty great list chesterton might be worth adding for another contemporary if youre looking for insight into a catholic worldview per 
  heres your reading chart canon vi of the first council of nicaea    let the ancient customs in egypt libya and pentapolis prevail that the bishop of alexandria have jurisdiction in all these since the like is customary for the bishop of rome also likewise in antioch and the other provinces let the churches retain their privileges and this is to be universally understood that if any one be made bishop without the consent of the metropolitan the great synod has declared that such a man ought not to be a bishop if however two or three bishops shall from natural love of contradiction oppose the common suffrage of the rest it being reasonable and in accordance with the ecclesiastical law then let the choice of the majority prevail  ancient epitome of canon vi the bishop of alexandria shall have jurisdiction over egypt libya and pentapolis as also the roman bishop over those subject to rome so too the bishop of antioch and the rest over those who are under them if any be a bishop contrary to the judgment of the metropolitan let him be no bishop provided it be in accordance with the canons by the suffrage of the majority if three object their objection shall be of no force     you are now orthodox reading chart is attached also listen to some jay dyer for the bigbrained takes
my heart leaps up when i behold  a rainbow in the sky  so was it when my life began  so is it now i am a man  so be it when i shall grow old  or let me die  the child is father of the man  and i could wish my days to be  bound each to each by natural piety

why have you spent hours on 4chan today when you could have read a book or gone outside
5
  yeah i know im trying to quit ive been on this site way too much in november
i can never decide what to read i have so many options in front of me and books are such a time investment that i struggle to just pick something up and read it sometimes
  4chan  stop living in the past
i only browse 4chan for about one hour before bed though and i did read quite a lot today
i did my duty which was to study i am free to do what i want not conform to what you prescribe    4chan has helped me tremendously knowledge ive acquired here which i othrwise wouldnt have had i gone outside
  because outside is for the beautiful people which im not
  you can read most books in about a week or two
  i consider that quite a big time investment
  you could be beautiful had you used your mind correctly
  liberals everyone
because its something to do during the commercial breaks in football
  i dont understand what youre trying to say
  i walked for an hour today i want to do more hiking when the snow melts but i gotta get more fit first
  do you have anything better to do even if you have a job or if youre a student you can probably still find time to read at least 50 pages on week days on weekends you can probably push it to 100 if you keep this rhythm youll be done in no time doesnt seem like such a serious investment to me
  i read a book today and also went outside and have been on 4channel for roughly half an hour
  i do actually read a decent amount i just couldnt decide what to start today so didnt read anything
  outside is cold wet and gray  i have no excuses to make about not reading a book
  just take some books out of your stack close your eyes mix em around and pick one
  man im fucking tired of being stuck in this loop of mindlessly browsing 4chan or the internet i just want to read mang i dont feel like i am in control of my actions anymore

  not if it translated properly but remember if you read translated works you are reading someone elses interpretation and not the work itself
  i enjoyed it immensley but as someone wiser once said translation is the death of comedy the language will definately read stilted more like a historical document
  meaningless   no

    does anyone actually own a nice collection does anyone actually own a collection that isnt just memetier
  speak for yourself
  yes
    wanna post
no 
    youre a silly waste of time for posting such useless content then and i dont believe that you have said collection
  why are you being mean on the internet i dont owe you anything i just helped you by pointing out this is a bait thread a couple of genuine pics but the early ones were cringe memes taken from somewhere else go read a book

  thats like looking at my parents bookshelf
  i left the majority of my collection at my parents house four years ago and have never gone back to get it ive gotten a fair amount of books since then but for a good portion of those years just used libraries cause no money have lived near main libraries in two towns plus libraries at school and not wanting to own books i dont care about that much or that i just want to quickly look at it kind of pains me that i dont have my full collection but i figure itll be like a birthday and christmas all in the same day when i get them all back
  nice

    ive read a lot of themits my job     ive managed two successful congressional campaigns and currently work with a political pr group i also am on the board of a hedge fund    my wealth and power are drawn directly from this library/body of knowledge will happily keep posting if you are interestedcan also provide in dept reading lists on a range of topics what are you most interested in
  how does the knowledge drawn from your library aid you in managing political campaigns
  appreciate the effort but still seems like some larper was just taking photos at a library
  its obviously not a library and doesnt look like a book store to me either but youd think if anon was as rich and powerful as he says hed get better shelves or have more room in his house to more neatly store all those books but we cant know for sure
  its obviously not a library   all the departments at my college have small libraries with specific lit which exactly look like this one
  no labels on the spine not in any sort of order ok but thats peculiar for a library
  sell all that shit and buy /lit/s approved 100 books
  no labels on the spine not in any sort of order  not necessarily but youre probably right the only realistic option is one person owns and read all these books and they post here
        jesus fuck you people are distrustful this is my goddamn basement heres some proofnow stfu with this larping bullshit    why do i have shelves like this because i live in an antebellum house that structurally cannot take the weight of a 12000 book library i have a nice library but its full of picture books and shit people like to linger around when drinking wine at dinner parties and shit on top of that i host people constantly and specifically keep my library outside the general public viewnot only do i find this totally distasteful and against the purpose of the library which is for my own accumulation of power but there is a lot of information in the library that i would not share with the people that tend to stop byeg people who also seek power but for their own purposes
        this seriously looks like a library to you what shittier university do you attend
  anyone can stand next to a bookshelf and hold a note into a camera desu

  all those books on bob hawke
  hey i remember you man werent you the guy offering people free books until some asshole annoyed enough to stop     if the offer is still open my request from last time is still up pagan mysteries in the renaissance its now been recommended by multiple poets ive been reading but ive had no luck finding them
its not organized in any way
  im enjoying it its semiautobiographical because its about dicks schizophrenic break and exegesis but he distances himself from it into third person i actually meant to buy the exegesis itself but on a second look its overpriced and valis is essentially the summary form anyway    good still need to get to nova express but i read soft machine mostly either on stimulants or microdosing lsd it lends itself well to nonsober reading
  despite the memes and clearly this is bait i do see some books i like here like the rise and fall of the third reich and i think i see some ballard or asimov and book of the new sun at the bottom  im sure you got this from reddit for instayous but if it is actually your shelf then theres some stuff on there i dont mind its not typically my thing though but if you enjoy it then no harm done anon
  what the fuck kind of shelf is that
   there are people out there right now who find it acceptable to display certain books in front of other books
  lmao honestly had such a great laugh at this and i really needed that my day had been so shitty thank you anon

  how did you get into reading the western classics    and if i were to get into the chinese classics where should i start cause the only chinese classics i ever in popular culture are the i ching confucius and sun tzu then again i havent gone around the chinese history circles at university but itd be like a chinese person thinking that the only western works worth reading was homer and some plato and thats it we have such a poor appreciation of china over here its depressing

im working on a political campaign to take the vote away from senors 65 unless one is still in the work force or undergoes testing to verify ones intelligence this is going to be a long battle and i am going to lose a lot of money due to ageism laws in canada so id like to get some book recommendations on citizenship and civic duty as well as works that deal with the hypocrisy of a disempowered youth and the empowered elderinfants whose deathdrive allays itself with conservative nihilist policies any recommendations for fixing our democracy by denying voting rights to the incompetent not including the fairer sex
youd better argue to take voting rights from anyone not having children or not taking care of their children your proposition is also worth considering though
   implying there is someone worth voting for  youre a bit too late buddy
i just read flowers for algernon what did i think of it
i dont know what did you
  the sub plot with richards was fantastic and superior to everything else in the book by so many order of magnitude its ridiculous and frankly inexplicable they way he connives his way into the conference for differentlyabled ventriloquists by feigning to be a mute was hilarious and geniustier writing and all the while theres just this feeling starting subtly mounting gradually coupled with insinuations reaching a crescendo before the moment he actually opens the backstage door and sees exactly what we all subconsciously knew was coming and yet never consciously guessed it 10/10    the rest was honestly good but when compared with that wonderfully wild and well written ride it couldnt help but feel middling
  its an okay book for high schoolers
pretty good book

  tardtier retort
ive been perplexed and amused by fabricated notions about socalled great books that for instance manns asinine death in venice or pasternaks melodramatic vilely written doctor zhivago or faulkners corncobby chronicles can be considered masterpieces or at least what journalists term great books is to me the same sort of absurd delusion as when a hypnotized person makes love to a chair
what a fucking god
what the fuck was his problem
  write vapid work that sounds pretty  criticize works that are orders of magnitude better than yours  hmm
  corncobbier detected

    has only read lolita and didnt even finish it

  nabokov is within the top 3 for english prose stylists imo but his novels never strike a deeper chord with me   he is the ultimate incarnation of style over substance so it makes sense that he would only rate writers with superior style because thats all he cared about   dont get me wrong i love his writing hes an undisputed master and deserves the acclaim but theres just more to be found in literature than just style and his words should be taken with a huge grain of salt
  why do brainlets always say he had no substance just because he didnt rely on overt sentimentality doesnt mean there is no substance to his writing    fucking plebs who only read excerpts of lolita
  go to bed mr ruskin
  theres substance but not great substance that you find in other great works of literature hes just mediocre in that regard
  how does he btfo me so thoroughly and repeatedly    hes been dead since like the 70s but every couple of months i discover some pithy remark he made in passing half a century ago that destroys every facet of my being    its not fucking fair there needs to be like antitrust legislation against nabokov that breaks up his intellectual monopoly on literature his iq is too high its stifling competition
  yes       dont call him a brainlet thats rude
  shut up
nabokov  substance  lolita and invitation to a beheading were skin deep compared to the masterpieces he criticizes theres something in pale fire but it doesnt even begin to approach the level of beauty of writers like mann and faulkner even jasons section in tsatf is deeper than anything nabokovs ever dreaming of writing and he didnt even realize it hes hilariously shallow didnt he place ulysses up on some godly divine pedestal lmao
  brainlet
never trust a man who doesnt understand/enjoy music
nabokov never once backed his opinions
  yes he does read lectures on literature for example
  he liked classical
  i hate this old ugly pedo so much
  i dont own it sorry could you perhaps give some examples here
  he can write but hes got nothing to say  isaac babel
  ulysses is godtier are you new or just illiterate
  no read and experience more peasant to call nabokovs works overly cerebral and relying on dark humor is a very valid criticism
  he can suck but hes got nothing to swallow  you
  nobbysuckers gonna suck
  i think he is on to something people have a tendency to exaggerate something to be much greater than it really is particularly if claiming to like that something will make them appear as wellread or sophisticated    take shakespeare for example nobody actually likes any of his writings but i know you will all pretend to like it because you want people to think youre smart there is nothing intellectual or cultured about bad puns you pretend otherwise though because you dont want people to think youre stupid even though you know deep down that you dont think theres anything special about shakespeare    its like the story about the emperors clothes the emperor is naked
there is something missing in all of nabokovs work his starchy aestheticism comes through as cold crystalline and almost inhuman we wait in vain for that warm human glow that pervades all the works of gogol turgenev dostoevsky tolstoy and chekhov and his work lacks the psychological or emotional depth that might have compensated for the limited range of characters and situations    when i read lolita i was initially overwhelmed by the verbal fireworks and the sparkling wit but i eventually tired of it and didnt finish it it didnt seem to be going anywhere    one can hear the clatter of surgical tools in nabokovs prose    nabokov inaugurated the literary culture of book nerds of books by and for bookish types and more egregiously books about elite middleclass professionals ie wankers    nabokovs work theoretically deals only with questions of art and style the artist and his art present readers with aloofness indifference and hermeticism it is all mechanics the perfect swiss watch the prototype of a postdarwinian vision of both life and art devoid of any spiritual dimension and denying any ordering force in the universe    essentially a bore selfindulgent fantasy    don quixote chased after a dream and unwittingly traversed through a dangerous and changing world nabokov chased after butterflies and undoubtedly acquired some scrapes and bruises which one was the fool    into the trash it goes
nabokov this is my opinion and therefore its true
nabokov was the original shitposter but ill never be not amused by corncobby chronicles or a nonentity means absolutely nothing to me or a favourite between the ages of 8 and 12 but not after
  clearly has neither read the stones of venice the central tenet of which espouses function over ornament for ornaments sake nor modern painters  good lord dude these are his masterpieces
is there something wrong with me for wanting to read lolita
  you know of a good edition of modern painters folio society did a decent stones of venice
  joyce is even more style over substance than nabokov the ultimate pseud
  i know what you mean man ts eliot used to be one of my all time favorite writers then i encountered nabokovs observation that his name is an anagram of toilets and he seems to have been ruined for me intellectually i understand that nabokovs witticism it is not a valid critique but its somehow really gotten to me ever since then i cant get through a single poem by him and when he comes up ill usually trash talk him excessively in my head and this is a poet who i used to say changed my life and who i went around declaiming all through high school
  telling people to read more when you cant even read one book with any depth sad
  dude even nabby thought shakes was the goat   the fucking length nabbyfags will go even if it mean contradicting nabby
  same sort of absurd delusion as when a hypnotized person makes love to a chair  he should read manns mario and the magician lmao
more often than not what is taken for substance is just a pretentious bias if it doesnt have style its garbage if it doesnt have an agenda all the better which is why nab hated orwell
  all writing has an agenda whether the author intended it or not
  vapid work that sounds pretty    sooooo all fiction ever written
  that guy isnt a nabbyfag
  no one wants to spoonfeed you    ah yes the great isaac babel an immortal writer lmao
  pure style will compensate for the gaping void where a soul should be  you know who else thinks like this
  hes right though its like comparing one bar of a chopin nocturne with a beethoven sonata it could lead you to think that chopin is the better composer but actually all he wrote was nothing but perfumed garbage
  i have rather old everymans library editions multivolume of each i collect them i rec each collection
  they can be had reasonably if in pieces on abe at least that was the case 5 yrs ago
  let him speak for himself then
  coming from the guy that probably thinks philosophical works that havent solved or done anything other than obfuscate and abstract arent vapid thats pretty rich
what does corncobby mean
  set in a rural shitscape with provincial themes and wewuzzin dimwit characters
  better than nabokov
  i love faulkner btw
  the second paragraph of lolita literally mocks this you nuretard
  thats ok 
  fair enough souls sound but agendas not   so do ihe can create a moment of atmospheric impression like nobodys businessbut you dont find him a bit pretentious joyce regretted his own odyssey reference
  no dummy its a reference to a salacious scene from his book sanctuary which is pretty typical of nabokov dismissing an entire writera work based on a throwaway novel written for money i dont particularly like faulkner but vlad was just dodging having to contend with his serious work
hes absolutely right about the fact that academia is full of charlatans who hide behind established works and figures take the bacchae by euripedes its absolutely worthless as art there are literal childrens books worth more than that book yet there are droves of academics who will defend it to the death
  thats not a book its a play you dumb faggot and its well known euripedes is the weakest of the tragedians
  your first point is weak pedantry and your second point does not disprove what he said about there being droves who would defend it
  oh i never read sanctuary
  pretentious  nigga he never graduated high school and never mouthpieces in any of his famous works
  your original post about the bacchae didnt make present any evidence or argumentation so heres my counterargument no its not
    caring this much about his opinion  not realizing half of what he was doing was literal trolling    pale fire is perhaps my favorite book but does that mean i really put much stock into what he says about eliot or pound not really no i mean this for your sake not mine for the love of god dont dislike something merely because nabby shit on it at one point
  it is i thought it was because faulkner smoked from a corncob pipe is there more info on this
  nabokov upset that he is nothing compared to mann second rate compared to that dilettantish bourgeois nonceponce what an insult and we all know nabokov resented his brothers inversion
  it wasnt my post which you can tell from how i said his and not mine in the post youre replying to youve now shown repeatedly you have no reading comprehension weak little baby brain
  hes cuntry
  is there more info on this  yeah read sanctuary or google sanctuary corn cob i dont know why people just make up their own answers
  like i said i understand its not rational i just cant help it eliots poetry used to be one of the great joys of my life now when i try to read the love song i just hear the sound of a toilet flushing in the back of my head because of nabokov
  nabokov upset that he is nothing compared to mann  mann was fucking awful man
  ts well known euripedes is the weakest of the tragedians  the bacchae is considered to be not only euripides greatest tragedy but one of the greatest ever written modern or ancient
  i cant say i disagree with him and since nabokovs weakest works are stronger than the supposed great books hes criticizing i dont think we can easily dismiss his opinions here
  im the guy who made up his own answer it just sounded like what nabokov mightve meant to me sorry if i stepped on your foot there
  every faulkner book ive read and the magic mountain are both better than pale fire and lolita and invitation to a beheading fwiw nabokov very clearly and obviously favored style over substance
  he favored it but he considered teacher to be one of the three aspects that make a major writer and you can detect it in his work if you are not a brainlet it is just not easy and pandering like it is in the work of people like mann and faulkner
   it is just not easy and pandering like it is in the work of people like mann and faulkner  thanks for making it clear youve never read either
  ive read everything by faulkner im the one who set people straight about the corncob diss coming from sanctuary and have read three of manns most famous works their morality is easy and they are inferior to nabokov
how the fuck is lolita not banned in every country
  you make a convincing argument pseud
  too infamous at this point
should i read pale fire
  more convincing than yours you havent made a real proposition either ive at least refuted every weak thing youve tried to say cited his good readers essay to show style isnt his only concern and proved ive read the lousy writers you liked
  please enlighten me as to how nabokovs teachings are less easy and superior to the likes of mann and faulkner certainly youd agree your viewpoint is not one that is common intuitive or unbiased especially considering you lift it directly from the man youre defending    only thing youve proved is that you cant get off his dick you even use his terms and cite his essays 
  but vlad was just dodging having to contend with his serious work  sounds like par for the course with nabokov really does he ever give more than just a couple lines of polemical bullshit in his critiques
  you can read his full lectures on two of his least favorite authors
  aesthetes problem good job being a drone though
  lol practically everyone on here is being spoonfed by nabokovs unsubstantiated babble on here anyway
  yeah youre lying
what books end up being revered has little to do with their actual merit but rather the whims of society journalists reviewers critics etc which causes these societal grooves to form where particular works become elevated for arbitrary reasons if you disagree with this consensus cucks will come out of the woodwork to defend it without thinking for themselves emperors clothes style  he was right to challenge these conventions
  agreed
  i read the sound and the fury two days ago and i am not sure that it surpasses your typical mark twain    its not that i dont think its an excellent book but it seems to me that the first part is a masterpiece of structure the second part a masterpiece of psychology and the two last parts are average work written as if faulkner just knew he had to finish it somehow and so invented a silly hollywood story about miss quentin running away with a circus guy in order to unsatisfactorily complete the cathedral he had started to build
constantly see nabokov jerked about here  finally decide to read him  deeply unimpressed  its cute that he suggested dostoyevsky was the mediocre one even stylistically nabokov is very middle of the road among well known authors
  merit is a social construct  thats a yikes famalam
  absolutely based and redpilled
    wtf
nabokov is /lit/ incarnate he constructs a mountain of bitter contrarianism having imagined himself in competition to disparage those who tower above him hes also a faggot
  literally our guy
  shitting on nabokovs style while praising dosto
  hes not a contrarian though he just has his own taste he likes popular authors and he hates popular authors you dont have to like everything in the canon
  less is more faggot dosto writes with great economy of expression    s not a contrarian though he just has his own taste
reminder he thought pynchon was a bitch    and a bad student
  nabukov would be the kind of person to write stupid pseud goodreads reviews on as i lay dying and heart of darkness that we all make fun of    lolita was only popular because it was controversial the plot was hot fucking garbage and the prose was nothing special
  explain how hes a contrarian he holds some of the most conventional literary opinions while diverting on others         he doesnt even shit on dosto as much as people make out
  only criticism he can come up with is some generic and meaningless remarks on plot and prose  calls nabby a pseud    why do you people act like nabby commented on stuff he knew nothing about youre going to have to make more than some off hand comment to prove he knew nothing about literature its not like the man wasnt willing to admit when his knowledge was lacking like he does with music for example
  im sure he knew a lot about pedophilia anon but he didnt seem to know much about writing an engaging or meaningful plot    humberts musings and internal monologues are interesting in lolita literally nothing about its incredibly bland and cliche plot is
  lolita is full of genre parodies so of course its clichéd as fuck you faggot
  no he didnt
  i agree the benjy and quentin parts are fucking amazing but it drops off extremely hard after that
  im glad you said this people even his fans seem to overlook that a big part of his work was parody
  its supposed to be cliche and uninteresting thats the point    ironic shitposting is still shitposting commenting on bad plots is not an excuse for writing a bad plot
  im not going to get into that since youve consistently shown you cant argue or form genuine opinions but if you or anyone else need it spelled out for you and cant be bothered to read fiction critically then check out the book the secret history of nabokov
  but its not for commenting the whole idea behind lolita is that nabby is constructing an artifical reality to mislead pseuds into some kind of a moralistic stance its not reality as fiction but fiction as reality its littered with references to its artificiality and genre parodies are only one aspect of it
  nobody actually likes any of his writings   yeesh
  yeah shakespeare is great
  nobody actually likes any of his writings  lol     yeah youre lying  but why as i explained in a later comment its not that i dont think his work has any depth its more that its not his strength if you go by the standard that the point of art is to shine light on the human condition i dont think his work excels in that regard
  this seems like a very large stretch to explain away what is by all means a poorlywritten physical plotline especially considering the fiction as reality is an absurd situation that has no basis in reality or truth how many times in real life has a pedophile burst into a hedonistic millionaires mansion to murder him for stealing his girlwife do you think its the plot of a generic soap opera with extra pedophiles not fiction as reality
  brainlet confirmed
  seriously whats not to like about shakespeare maybe if your new to elizabethan english its a little frustrating but even a somewhat educated reader should be able to get over that hurdle quite easy and just have fun with it  i could see arguing that hes overrated but saying that no one actually enjoys his writing is pretty yikes tbqhwy
  i always found it funny that humbert baits the analysis of his childhood with the first failed sexual encounter of his adolescence and then hands it over to the reader having made it blisteringly obvious and thus really unappealing to explore any further purposefully dead in the critics hands
  if you dont like him its because you find him difficult  when youre done yapping pass the onions burgers
  you confuse the two anon
  cool argument anon i like it a lot
  i literally said the exact opposite you brainlet
  brainlets dont need to be argued with 
  not so much   you dont like him its because you find him difficult  as if you cant understand why other people might enjoy his work you clearly havent got past the entry level barrier  almost the opposite really my point was more that shakespeare is not difficult to enjoy so its ridiculous to say that no on actually likes him
  fiction as reality is an absurd situation that has no basis in reality or truth  thats the whole point lmao
  in your own words you said it was not reality as fiction but fiction as reality constructing a poor and cliched plot line isnt presenting a fictional take as reality its literally just aping trends thatve been done before more poorly to be entirely honest its very difficult to read your explanations as anything more than cognitive dissonance to explain away nab writing an unbelievable meaningless and profoundly boring plot
  what is it in shakespeare you dislike or find overrated genuinely curious
  its good that you dont even bother then i like it when someone sticks to their philosophy
  just to add im not arguing with you because you dont like shakespeare thats fine im arguing because you made the bizarre claim that no one likes him when hes very accessible when you get past the original 400 year old language barrier  even if you dont like him it should be easy to see why other might
  the issue is that by making a point to say he is not difficult you are implying thats why someone here would not like him i know hes not difficult i had read and understood most of his works by 8th grade hes very juvenile again you are a s o y loser phony
  since people arent making the logical conclusion of that statement i guess ill just explain it outright why would anyone bother reading something that neither associates itself in reality with any way nor uses its intentionally fake nature as a vehicle unless you want to claim that the artificiality is the point and its all about how morals and ethics doesnt real at which point the question remains of why you would possibly bother reading it in the first place    its better than the alternative of nabokov just straight up writing a shitty plot sure  which is what he actually did  but its unrealized highschool tier philosophy at best when treated as intentionally fake
  there is much more to the book than you currently think i suggest you to read the annotated version at least before making such statements
  if i keep pasting basedboy memes ill make a coherent point eventually  again completely missing my point couldnt care less that you personally dont like him its that you claim that no one does
  but it is intentionally fake anon its the whole point of nabokovs fiction its his gimmick that even most of his fans dont get
  a i never made that claim this  was my first post b you would not have liked shakespeare if you had encountered his works anonymously same with pretty much everyone sorry youre so s o y
  so what makes a great book nobby why didnt you share that opinion    are you implying there are no so called great books because im convinced that there are you yourself worshipped ulysses as if it were the second coming so what is it dead man
  because its an eloquently constructed literary puzzle with no clearcut didactic message slapped on it its metafiction without openly admitting to being metafiction
  sorry youre so poorly read     your college failed you by not exposing you to that
    then ill ask again why i or anyone else should bother taking anything he writes seriously if a work doesnt concern itself with reality its not going to say or do anything physically interesting by design which nabokovs works do not the only reason to read intentionally artificial works are when the fakeness is used to convey a point about reality such as what waiting for godot does if the only point to it is the artificiality and circularly that the artificiality means that the subjects of the work are irrelevant then its not only a philosophically empty piece its also a complete and utter waste of time to read through at least if you read for something other than pure prose in which case your time would be spent just as well reading rupi kaur    i prefer to consider nabokov slightly more intelligent than that if only because i dont want to have completely wasted the time ive spent reading his works        wrong a brilliantly constructed literary work is one in which you can draw countless interesting and cohesive points and interpretations from  something like crime and punishment a puzzle with no solution is a useless piece of shit claiming after the fact that not having a solution is actually the solution is circular logic and tells you absolutely nothing but it makes pseuds go woah
  physically interesting  
  if you cant enjoy a piece of work for its aesthetic qualities and want to be spoonfed moral teachings instead than do as you wish
  a brilliantly constructed literary work is one in which you can draw countless interesting and cohesive points and interpretations from    a puzzle with no solution is a useless piece of shit    lmao
  i though you were the original anon  i was replying to who made that claim  why can you not see why people would enjoy shakespeare even if he is juvenile people like juvenile things im not discussing the quality of his work people like plenty of shitty things your claim makes no sense which is why im continuing the futile discussion to try and unravel what you could possibly mean    used up 4chan memes are good insults  i think juvenile or not you could do with reading some more shakespeare and borrow some of his wit good or bad its still miles more entertaining than yours
  ie plot and message       aesthetic qualities are meaningless and vapid if they have no significance behind them everyone enjoys vapid meaningless things from time to time listening to music that doesnt make you feel anything but sounds nice for instance but dont try to claim that esthetics can supersede actual meaning      brainlet
  as someone that greatly prefers dostoevsky to nabokov youre kinda talking nonsense   had the same thought as this anon  youre contradicting yourself
  ie plot and message   this makes me no less perplexed by your choice of of adverb
  you would not have liked shakespeare if you had encountered his works anonymously  hahahahahaha  post something you wrote anything thats not from an online duscussion please  hahaha
  yikes
    i really didnt think that needed explanation but alright no solution // no single solution they are vastly and dramatically different a puzzle with no single solution could have thousands of different valid solutions that offer something interesting and fresh in interpretation while a puzzle with no solution would be one that has no actual significance no matter what interpretation you draw from it       as opposed to a piece that is fun to read or aesthetic
  as opposed to a piece that is fun to read or aesthetic  yeah i get it what i dont get is why you said physically
  no one likes him hes the epitome of good writer in peoples minds and so they either pretend or go in trying really hard and convince themselves that they see what is supposed to be good about him hardly anyone who likes shakespeare likes any writer with even a remotely similar style to him its just pretend
  physical is in reference to elements of the piece that are on the page so to speak you can lay out the plot structure of a work interpret its symbolism and meaning and even analyze the prose but the aesthetic sense is felt instead of analyzed or understood it was relevant in the context of the discussion
  explain how shakespeare got his reputation in the first place especially when his contemporaries hated him and saw him as a pleb
  well i suppose i have a different definition for the word solution  maybe from being a maths student  what youre talking about sounds like an interpretation not a solution
  because people liked him
  well just say that then    his contemporaries hated him and saw him as a pleb  source
  probably some subversive jew got the ball rolling not because he liked the englishman but because he knew he could use the dick jokes and incestuous royalty to undermine western civ
  you are talking about interpretations not solutions you use beckett as an example but his plays are similar to lolita they provide no solutions only a myriad of different interpretations
  solution is sometimes used in literary analysis to refer to an individuals comprehensive understanding of the overall meaning of a piece because understanding is relative good literature should not have a single solution as would a mathematical problem
  read       the entire point of what i said and my critique of your understanding of lolita as fiction as reality and an artificial work is that that interpretation leaves lolita without any valid comprehensive and total interpretation whatsoever or you know a solution
  this  but so what if they dont like writers with similar styles theres a reason why hes gone down as a giant in the first place and theyve been largely forgotten   that aside  whats not to enjoy theres nothing particularly complex or inaccessible and plenty of common plot threads that people enjoy  great word play putting aside the whole towering giant business why cant people just enjoy say midsummer nights dream as they would a comedy
  but so what if they dont like writers with similar styles  weak use of quotes faggot its not a subjective concept  it shows they are faking you know who i think is great tolkien and i like writers like him same with everyone and the writers they like but meanwhile when it comes to shakespeare most people will be like steinbeck fans or whatever but also just like him and not christopher marlowe or whoever
  ah okay just to be clear though maths problems can have multiple solutions its just that the solutions dont contradict/disagree with each other if youre right youre right and thats that
  without any valid comprehensive and total interpretation whatsoever  i said it before its an openended ethical puzzle deliberately constructed to challenge your moral boundaries as a reader not every work of fiction has to convey some didactic message to have artistic merit lart pour lart
  you know who i think is great tolkien and i like writers like him  nothing wrong with tolkien but just lol this explains a lot  and i approach literature very differently there are some common threads of interest but my favourite writers are very diverse in terms of style time period etc
  hardly anyone who likes shakespeare likes any writer with even a remotely similar style to him
  thank god we have proust who cares about nabokov
  hes the second biggest writer that people pretend to like hardly anyone reads him anyway though but fair enough bloom and a few others may genuinely like shakespeare though
  just the fact that most of nabbys criticisms are sweeping and vague and one or two lines is reason enough to disregard them    at the very least the works of mann conrad hemingway faulkner etc deserve more than what nabokov gives them and in fact nabokovs statements are fairly irresponsible and frankly childish nabokov himself said that criticism gives readers including the author of the book some information about the critics intelligence or honesty or both and his cavalier assessments betray more than a little about either his honesty or intelligence or both     nabokovs four great masterpieces of the 20th century are all very pretty reads at least in english translation probably moreso in the native language but with the possible exception of belys petersburg they are painfully shallow and wear their themes on their sleeves they are not works renowned for their thematic depth or teachings as nabokov would put it on to be cliche but appropriate the human condition nabokovs famous works widely conform to this characteristic as well except its never really clear what is being taught or if anything is being taught at all pale fire particularly is essentially a treasure hunt with no treasure when you finally find the x and start digging enchanting sure but ultimately vapid and dull masked under smoke and mirrors lolita is the same i dont mean this as a criticism more as stating the facts     so its no surprise that nabokov likes the works that he does and dislikes works that have some depth under the surface like dosto and mann and faulkner and conrad best just to take his opinions at face value the same way youd take some random faggot on 4chans discard them theres nothing there except lack of intelligence or honesty and theres no point reading into it
  these interview snippets arent full criticisms
  kill your self i usually just write down kys but you deserve it in full
  and i approach literature very differently  your approach is to lie to yourself
  in search of lost time  painfully shallow  kys
  nabokov vladimir shitty esl writer probably pedophile dislike him works read pretty but ultimately are a form of mental masturbation theres nothing under the surface thought well of him from age 812 but have since grown up
  banning books in 2018 in non nigger countries
  not him but the primary motif is literally unironically in the title desu senpai
  jokes aside the search is worth the effort
  did you read pale fire
  yes theres nothing in it please prove me wrong protip you cant
  everyone with different tastes to me must be lying  there are plenty of supposedly great writers i dislike and plenty i love that arent seen as important i still have quite a diverse list of things i like and dislike many things that are supposedly similar for example i love camus and hate sartre
lol this thread proves you guys have such an elementary understanding of literature
  people that cant speak frog      im the one youre replying to yes its my favourite of his
  i love camus and hate sartre
  yes please tell me how you use criticism to arrive at objective ranks of works
  thats fucking brilliant
  based nabby strikes again
  since when did nabokov even claim it to be objective he is clearly using his own opinion you twit
    cormac mccarthy
    he was just mad he couldnt produce something with the same honesty as the sound and the fury what a pathetic cunt
  anagramtoilets  just a sophisticated form of aesthetic censure a type fwr very effective these days by aesthetic i mean makes a direct appeal to the readers senses of course consider nietzsche for instance who employs this mode over and over again the stench of christianity for instance he must plug his nose and turn quickly away lest he vomit all over the place etc essentially nabokov does the same at the remove of two figures an anagram that doubles as a metonymy the plural toilets brings public toilets to mind where toilets  stinks t s eliot stinks  id say youve been seduced by his wit when a broader understanding is gained of the use of such figures the mighty dont fall so easily in ones microcosmos
  kek but also ive quite recently really gone off eliot
  says the guy who got mad over comments made over 60 years ago    lmfao baka
  brainlet read his comments
  he presented it as though it were pretty objective
is he the greatest pseud to ever walk this earth

i hate nabokov but manns prose fucking sucks
  i personally dont get the hype of conrad i dont understand why hes hailed as such an amazing prose stylist and i didnt find heart of darkness very engaging in either its themes or narrative  id like to understand but i dont
  ive only read mann in translation the magic mountain and his faustus and whilst i enjoyed them i felt at the time that his characters were a little too prone to enacting his theories for him like vessels for his ideas feeling a little unnatural  though at other times they seemed really believable there does seem something quite unfashionable about his modernist realism
  a huge grain of salt
  faulkners corncobby chronicles  goddam
nabokov is a great writer in the sense that he is a great grammarian he isnt a great writer in the sense that dostoevsky is a great writer this explains nearly all his bad takes all these critiques of his have the same tone as those of the university educated playwrights from shakespeares day who disdained him before he was universally recognized as a genius im convinced that this snobbery is an intellectual limitation more than anything aesthetic provincialism with its nose turn up a great writer by the standards of critics of this sort would seem to one who is a master of form content be damned whose style does nothing to offend the literary fashions and cultural sensibilities of the intellectual elite in the particular time period in which they are writing which it goes without saying are drastically different from those of critics living in previous and subsequent periods yet dostoevsky has saved the lives of countless young men living over a hundred years after he died will anyone in the throes of despair ever decided against committing suicide because they read pale fire it seems more likely theyd go through it before finishing it
  lol shut up faggot
  you could just have said he is a pseud
  i do see why hes revered as prose stylist but i also failed to engage with heart of darkness despite that ive decided just to come back to him later to see if it clicks
  based
    based and redpilled      dude was a pedophile libtard but i repeat myself
  rereading lolita  crying uncontrollably again  every fucking time bros
    nabokov is right about him conrad is a romantic writer for boys past a certain age you stop caring about him
  ulysses is godtier are you new    confirmed for being unable to form his own opinions outside of 4chan    a modern tragedy really
  actually probably the complete opposite conrads prose is actually difficult because its so dense  and this is probably the reason why he gets such low ratings on goodreads   i dont even like conrad yet but two of the most well read and educated people i know say hes a favourite and advise me to come back to him at a future date i trust their judgement more than some guy on 4chan and a man who flippantly albeit entertainingly discarded half the best works ever
  nabokov was more well read and educated than your friends i can promise you that    but thats besides the point you dont even like conrad but are deferring because of his reputation grow a spine lmao
  i dont like conrad but i dont think i get him im always wary of disparaging writers who have gone down as great as theres pretty much always a good reason for it its an easy way to look like an idiot three years ago i wouldnt have seen the point of many of my favourite authors now and theres no better guide than what history has deemed worth keeping thus far   i dont doubt nabokovs genius but with the amount of great writers hes derided that i do revere it would be foolish to take his comment as the truth  also forgot to add that both people are decades older than me and much more experienced  certainly not schoolboys conrad may not ever be up my alley but discarding his talents just sounds ignorant  nabakov may have gotten away with it because he was nabokov but most everyelse just sounds foolish saying it
  i dont like conrad but i dont think i get him  hes a fairly simple writer most of his novels are nautical adventures and spy thrillers with some didactic moralising   im always wary of disparaging writers who have gone down as great as theres pretty much always a good reason for it  hype doesnt equal quality
  hype doesnt equal quality  i think after 100 years its not really hype anymore    hes a fairly simple writer most of his novels are nautical adventures and spy thrillers with some didactic moralising  only read heart of darkness and this was the complete opposite of my experience this just sounds like someone just read the blurb for the good soldier or something you make him sound like john le carré
  npc meets literature
  le carré is a better writer than conrad as it happens
  i think heart of darkness is incredibly overrated but conrad takes a lot of the ideas from the novel and rewrites them in lord jim a few years later which interestingly seems self aware of its romance  i really recommmend it  much more psychological and dare i say ironic than hod also the secret agent is an absolute bop
  this    only a retarded arrogant pseud desperate to validate their hobby values meaning over beauty a masterful writer let alone storyteller can imbue their art with meaning but its in every single way secondary to the purest essence of the art itself
  deeper
  this its cringey when they try to have a point especially when the point is just the authors retarded undeveloped opinions poorly inserted and ruinous no good fiction writer is going to have good ideas in the deep sense and if they do they wont be able to marry them its best when left vague and interpretive so you can actually derive something by your own mind that isnt so vapid and childish these points can be written plainly their vapidity exposed whereas something without a point at least not a strict one can result in the reader walking down their own nuanced paths of thought and reevaluation    actually id like to experiment with generated text by many means random included and see if it would be useful in coming up with ideas or new angles we see things subjectively of course so different people can get very different ideas about some piece of text when attempting to derive its meaning despite it lacking any that is intentional we have different memories habits personalities associations and so forth you could think of it as trying to find a good trigger
  its not about the ideas themselves but how their communicated  good idea writers like dostoevsky arent good in simply having the idea but in the picture they paint to elucidate it if it were just an idea that can be communicated without the work theres no point to their work its about what they show about the human condition that cant be communicated just telling someone an idea but in showing them the idea  and theres a beauty in that itself theres a lot of ways to write good literature than merely aesthetically pleasing work
  are you saying melville isnt a good writer though cause i will admit typee isnt too great
  if anything jasons chapter is the most psychologically probing
how do i really put a wrinkle in the jammies of this natalist at my swim club can you guys help me brainstorm some ideas that will just rumble his jumblies something fierce or give me a book on the weaknesses of the natalist mindest thats always something ive wanted to spend hours learning about

hey were can a guy find history pdfs for free im looking for    the phoenicians and the west politics colonies and trade  by maria eugenia aubet mary turton paperback  and  ancient phoenicia an introduction classical world by mark woolmer 20110616
  check library genesis libgen
  or maybe go to a real library
  yeah but i would like to have a copy of these around libgen has a bit by woolmer on his greece historical stuff thanks for the suggestion anyhow
can you name one good debut novel published in the last two years
my diary desu
i dont read an author until they have a few good books under their belt or if they made a one hit wonder decades ago that has been cemented in literature history reading a book takes too much time to gamble on a new work
  you can work out if a book is worth reading within two hours at the most thats not a gamble
  those two hours add up when you keep gambling on new shitty works nearly all books released in the last two years were shit especially debuts
so in other words no
/lit/ youre pathetic you complain about the current state of literature and yet you dont vote for what matters now with your money if we supported solid contemporary literature even if it wasnt perfect we could change the market   search for debut novels from the past few years what do you see mostly idpol rubbish thats partially our fault npcs buy what theyre told on command and the market bends to their whims but if we began supporting contemporary artists we could get publishers to take on similar artists which means the market shifts toward a more desirable landscape
  you fat dog
  yeah but you know im right too
  no
personally i like the tiny bit of hope the left version implies that the human spirit cannot be destroyed in its entirety but i feel like the way orwell wrote it the right version was his intention if winston was going to write 22 and stop i feel like emphasis would have been put on the uncertainty and struggle of being legitmantly unsure instead its described as an automatic and unconscious act
22    is more subtle    225  just sounds like hurr durr totalitarianism presents untruth to the mind    but orwell sucks
  basado y rojo pìldora
  why are there these two versions  its not it was translated from ancient taelon
  people are censoring a book about censorship
  im not sure anyone knows for sure    american copies always had 5 british editions sometimes had 5 and sometimes just 22 depending what decade it was printed in it changed the two versions go all the way back to original two publishing runs some people think it was an accidental error that got replicated for decades other people beleive that orwell himself decided to change it since he was still alive barely when the the 22 version was being preparation for printing
  22    is cooler like whatever answer you give us its going to be wrong because we create the truth    while   225  is more limited in scope
  i keked

  damn i dont give a fuck about anything shes saying but listening to her talk is comfy as fuck

true west by sam shepard is outstanding kinda like a raymond carver story but with truer more authentic dialogue just saw a filmed version from the 70s with gary sinise and john malkovich watch it i dont think youll be disappointed     
  sorry not from the 70s but from 1984
the weir by conor mcphereson  a bunch of culchies sit around in a bar telling each other and a pretty younger newcomer from the city ghost stories
was he a cuckold why else would he have drinked the hemlock like that    also did plato want to fuck alcibiades did socrates cuck him
  idk maybe read the dialogue he drinks hemlock
  it doesnt really explain it he just does whatever the government tells him to like a bitch
  plato was using him as an example of the devotion to the polis that any citizen should have
was jesus a fuck
  cuckold is the thinking mans fetish
  have you even read plato
i guess you could call it tacit cucksent
  ill be honest i skimmed him it was boring af in my defense
  plato is boring  yikes
  i mean you probably like him because youre boring and a nerd

im a korean and i hate korean literature so bad
  why arent you working to become the first korean author who doesnt suck dick it is your holy literary responsibility to redpill your fellow gooks on the horrors of kpop industry and videogame autism
  im not really interested in our literature but you dont have to be such a dick my fellow gook anon  our ancestors only wrote goddamn poems anyway

do you think wikipedia is a good source of information do you think it ranks with the other great encyclopaedias    bonus round is wiktionary comparable with other dictionaries such as oxford or collins
verify the content with the sources
wikipedia should not be used by anyone for any reason whatsoever im being completely serious     wikipedia google searches and related onestop info sources will destroy knowledge which possesses a structure by reducing it to structureless fact bubbles bearing no relation to the history of ideas as they were actually developed    this kind of fact consumption leads people into engaging in discourse/arguments when in the passed they would have merely shrugged their shoulders and moved along it seduces one into believing they know about x when in fact they know very nearly nothing 2 or 3 facts about x     example all i know about nietzsche the will to power wrote a book called thus spoke zarathustra 19th century german philosopher god is dead    do you know who nietzsche is    yes of course    do you like nietzsche    no he was anti religion and i think he paved the way for nazism    this kind of conversation is not even about the topics it purports to be discussing it is vast reduction into atomised facts bearing almost no relation at all to the things they name     i dont think it can be stopped but yiu can stop yourself from being consumed by it
also wikipedia is completely overrun with propoganda subtle advertising and ideology not surprisingly in relation the pages in question
  wikipedia is a good place to start it has much pages than any others  for a philosophy however use     bonus round wiktionary  is there an online version of those      this you just have to watch out for pages and check the sources for bias
can we start a new critique thread thanks if so ill post what i have much appreciated

did a book ever ruin you life
my diary did
  les chants de maldoror i was 10 yo i wasnt ready for that shit
  same
  kreutzer sonata   still havent finished it because it changed my mindset way too much way too fast
  chastityposter
  no sorry i dont know what youre talking about
proust
  whats this about
  a professor that goes to live on the hills while the great war burns down turin  its incredibly well written and the best book ive ever read about survivors guilt
  how did it ruin your life
  i think i internalized it too much i dont know its just that after that i never truly put myself out there anymore its like something clicked  not trying to justify my shortcomings and i didnt know this until i recently reread it after about seven years
i left the garden of eden  i can never go back
i wanted to be a marine biologist since i was four and have always been super into taxonomy and natural history of all sorts when i started having access to the internet and reading big boy literature i was 11 thats when i read the end of the line and started using the internet to learn all the horrors going on in the world i raged became depressed i was finna shoot my life went to shit around that time and my desire to do well and follow my dreams has been perpetually crushed ever since which i think was an inevitablity given the state of the world and my personality and interests
its been a long time    i once lurked here regularly back when i was taking my masters in philosophy oh how little has changed still the same pedestalization of ulysses gravitys rainbow and infinite jest still the same foolish contrarianism about shakespeares supposed mediocrity still the same old /lit/ core lists albeit with a few slight revisions some shuffling of lolita to a lower rank here some overgenerous elevation of the book of disquiet to a higher line there how wonderful it is to return to see again this soothing purple and light blue palace whose labyrinthine corridors it was my wont to haunt for hours at a time watching and sometimes talking with its faceless inhabitants and guests oh how i missed it    i missed the shallow and uninformed analyses of great philosophers kids tripping over their fingers trying feverishly to type some unintelligible interpretation of dasein will to power or dialectic then posting their madcap ravings and standing guard over them like soldiers over their very sons as if ready to fight to bleed to die if necessary in their defence i missed the scoldings of delicate unlovables posturing as willing celibates and gallant knights of faith i missed the banter the camaraderie the sense of being a part of an aesthetic underground a secret club whose members knew as i did of the incomparably poignant bliss to which the life of the mind leads its acolytes even if only for fleeting moments of intuition and vision
  but though my return to the old stomping ground has brought fluttering into my heart some slight notes of nostalgia as when one visits the elementary school playground under whose monkey bars one received  from chantelle the skater girl who began to accentuate her dark watchful eyes with mascara many months before her dawdling contemporaries caught on and followed suit  ones first kiss it is true what they say about home you really cannot return     the rickety playground has been bulldozed and replaced with a safer shinier model chantelle is pregnant with her fourth child and this one rumour scandalously has it was sired by neither of her former husbands we could not kiss again as we did that early spring morning for the monkey bars are gone and with them have departed the children we once were having faded into nothing more than the glimpses i have of them in moments of rumfuelled revery so too with the man i once was on /lit/ and so too with /lit/ itself still the same old place and yet at least to me so deeply conspicuously different
  i wanted to think a great thought one that would pierce the otherwise impenetrable bubble in which the common man exists i wanted to speak with the great thinkers and writers of history not as a fawning idolator but as a peer i wanted to write in short i wanted the very things that you yourselves do but somewhere along the way i rubbed the film of magic from my eyes and saw my most precious desires irretrievably transformed into vain delusions    tomorrow morning i will wake up at 6 am i will groggily trudge downstairs i will sip my coffee as i watch the news i will shave shower and dress i will take a granola bar from the pantry step out of the house into the frigid and snowswept albertan winter drive shivering in my car to work and slump down at my desk there i will try yet again to work without thinking without feeling without acknowledging that the rest of my life will be wasted labouring at a job i hate for money i need to feed myself i will try to work without acknowledging that regardless of whatever else i could have done with my life on a fundamental level none of it really could have been otherwise its all just mindless work its all just boredom disillusionment smoke and vanity its all just wandering through a grey waste searching for moments of lucidity and happiness and clinging to them like a drowning man to another prolonging only slightly the end to which they both to which we all are gradually sinking

      pretty gud diary desu
  were you a tripfag and/or irish
  neither my dude
i just logged in the first time in a long time as well friend whose mental being brought him to here     how long have you been gone what has changed in your life since
      welcome back prodigal incel pic related your prose tonight we feast for you have returned home
  im not op but what do u mean ur friends mental being what happened
i left 4chan for some years as well i started in 2006 and left from 2013 to around 2016 i think its hard to remember exactly as the years blur together the site is the same at the core though there are things which are different the style of humor has morphed through the years sincere  ironic  currently postironic all of the political spamming is an expression of this i think i enjoyed the ironic phase the most back around 2010 or so
  what do you mean by postironic
this fucking wall  no tldr in sight  summarize it faggot i dont come here to read i come here to avoid it
  just read you illiterate baboon
  the same foolish contrarianism about shakespeares supposed mediocrity  sorry im a pleb but did you mean that shakespeare is mediocre and contrarians say hes genius the double negative with fool supposed got me confused
  the same foolish contrarians asserting shakespeares mediocrity
  its expressing something sincere in an ironic fashion eg tfw no gf
    to explain a little better a good example is the change from mfw to tfw my face when was a joke in which you would post a face which didnt necessarily reflect your own reaction about something the joke was the impression created by the face you posted this is an ironic joke that feel when is a joke in which the joke represents what you actually feel making it postironic this is opposed to a simple sincere joke which is just funny on a surface level like over 9000 or something
nicely written and some poignant observations i think most people can relate to your struggle with the meaninglessness of a 21st century wageearning existence i know i can the only advice i can offer is to cling to beauty whether that is in the form of literature music family friends nature or a mix of all of these savor the beautiful turn of phrase the mothers hug the mellow orange of the sunset for it is in these moments that our souls are elevated from our dreary toil if you are able to take pride in your work do so
now now wagie i must interject you arent submitting to drudgery merely to feed yourself because it is not necessary to resort to yearlong wageslavery simply to subsist unless you are a sucker
talk about your story to keep these poor threads alive four more days edition    what works inspired your story  how long had you been thinking about the story before writing it    
  is it too late to start
  youve got less than 4 days so unless youre ready to write 12500 words a day for the next 4 days then yeah
  nothing in particular inspired my story though a few years ago i read the godspeaker trilogy and after i analyzed the feeling and thought itd be really cool to write a similar story over time the idea has changed and refined in my head but i guess this is the manifestation of that original feeling    there are two main viewpoints in totally different regions  a runaway princess and a mad sorceress the princess is innocent and surrounded by her five trusted companions and she is trying to reach a city to the north with lots of fantasy landmarks between the sorceress has her one main traveling companion and tries her hardest not to use her powers as she heads to the princesss home its slowly revealed that she avoids using them because in order to use the powers she needs to burn her own memories  tldr at the end of the book the princess with only three of her companions left reaches a mysterious oracle with curses her to the power the sorceress the vp was really her in the future over time she forgets why she is returning home and that its home at all and as her memories faded she began to assume she was heading there to murder the king because her companion corrupted at one of the cursed landmarks and a totally different person has been suggesting it and the book ends with the sorceresss viewpoint finally arriving at the home city
  this sounds very appealing to me how far along are you
  what works inspired your story  those would have to be the werewolf the forsaken core rule book various kyell gold books the long goodbye from hyperion    how long had you been thinking about the story before writing it  at least since high school so 8 or 9 years now ive always thought id write a fantasy or science fiction story but id never really considered incorporating a romance element that didnt happen until the middle of october i was disappointed by kyell gold and tank jaegers books none of them were terribly compelling and i wanted to write something that is
  i tried to rush for nanowrimo but its difficult to change my habits i go two or three days without writing then have a session where i vomit up about 34k words so according to my log ive only wrote five times in november and have about 20k words  at this point the princess has reached the first landmark which is an entire forest which had been petrified by a lovemad witch whose whispers now haunt it the future her the sorceress is currently making her way through a swamp the last chapter i wrote had her setting up camp and then being attacked by undead beneath the mire during the night
god fucking damn it    i really tried this year i was going hard on this shit and i still managed to fuck it all up in the end i was on track to make the 50000 until around 1 week ago i binge played skyrim and it screwed me out of my freetime     i guess theres always next year
  you still have time
more a general writing question but what should your strategy be as an author looking to be published for the first time submit to any online shitzine that will have you actually look for a decently reputable journal that you enjoy and try there give up and self publish and hope some bored anon bothers to read you     i literally have no exposure to the literary world outside of /lit/ i know people here like to meme about how ded literature is but it seems to be at least somewhat alive given the amount of magazines and journals you can find plz help
  this depends on what you are hoping to publish if youre a short story writer get short stories published anywhere soon youll have a resume of random magazines and will be able to get published far easier start at the bottom and earn your way to the top    if you write novels
  i go two or three days without writing then have a session where i vomit up about 34k words    we are on the same wavelength this happened to me after a wopping 6k word kill then i had nothing for about 3 days after ward  just got 3k today and it feels good phew    how is scrivener by the way is it good enough to pirate    if anyone is struggling with their word processor i recommend calmlywritercom  shit is distraction free and displays your word count as you type  they have some tiein plug with grammarly but you have to manually activate for it to do anything so i dont think its a concern      i only just reached 36k today my man keep truckin  you can do it
  i like your premise i guess the challenge is not to make the twist too obvious the second people hear memory deletion but also to give the reader some misleading impression about how the two plotlines will collide for tension     technical niggles     defensibly should read defensively   when it neared the surface should be had neared to avoid tense mismatching   the erecting their tent parenthesis should probably be a full clause
  id actually been working on a different thing with similar themes for a while and got the idea for this one as a sort of thematic sequel it was fun to just start something new and ive managed more of this than i had in several months on the other    the idea at the start was to be a bit murakami sliceoflife style meditative everyday stuff but with a comic turn as ive gone on this month its got a bit more mysteryflavoured as a result of my trying to get a plot in nothing supernatural just plot hooks about other characters aims and a soft love triangle
  what works inspired your story  a tenryuu doujin by dam labo    how long had you been thinking about the story before writing it  about eight months although it changed pretty drastically in the leadup to nano
  i love scrivener even though i barely use any of its features being able to click all of the scenes on the left and label them write in fullscreen and export in one click with endless personalization is everything i need i pirated my copy years ago but ive been thinking of buying it because of how much it has helped id recommend pirating and trying it for sure      yes thats been something im struggling with in the sorceress chapters and right now its probably really obvious but ill handle polishing the mystery in one of the rewrites    technical niggles  thanks     the erecting their tent parenthesis should probably be a full clause  i aint got no degree in this shit bruh can you explain this again in laymans terms
  he threw away his literary aspirations for the a terrible video game
    tents    i just feel like the sentence is too busy if you say they stopped erecting their tent that makes it sound instantaneous but you also describe some sort of decision making process it just reads a bit funny that way
put my story into the nanowrimo word counter  its 50 words bigger  tfw gonna make it
2k left get fucked normies
    what genre are your stories anons
   id recommend pirating and trying it for sure  man that sounds cool thanks for the recc anon ill definitely try it out
  im not really sure its postpost apocalypse australia about a mechanic and robot but its not written like genre fiction so it doesnt feel right calling it scifi its mostly focused on the main characters the robot growth as a person
15k words to go  tthats alright ill just write 5k words a day
  mainly dragonlance a novel i forget the name of involving a magic system i thought was neat and a pathfinder campaign my friend ran that wasnt a complete trainwreck of furry bullshit it was only partially a trainwreck of furry bullshit    the first book was five years of drafts rewrites and revisions because i didnt want it to be a steaming pile of garbage now that ive polished my writing skills enough to feel comfortable and im on the second book i guess only about three months i didnt plan the sequel out that much until the first was fully revised
  during your next writing break go take a typing speed test then multiply your wpm by 60 to get your words/hour
  just  fucking  do it    i believe in you anon
  i dont know if itd be accurate but id call it sci fi slice of life i like your premise artificial intelligence finding their humanity is something that im working on as well
  huh well there you go so ive got about four hours of typing to do double it for small breaks to think of what to write and eight hours really isnt so bad
  i wish this was how writing worked i could easily type 5k by dedicating one hour according to your calculation gods i wish i was a robot
one hour and a half gone by  only 900 words so far    like trying to get a goddamn wall to dance the watusi  i can walk up to the bricks i can bow and cajole but i cant make this fucker move  reeeeee
  thats 896 more words than i have after 4h today but easy wrote almost 8k yesterday fuck my brain
    i know where youre coming from man all of my shit has been pantsonhead sporadic    why cant the words come when we summon them  how do the published wizards do it
  its not even that hard for me to follow a long term schedule its just the lack of regularity in the workflow thats annoying even during the productive days i often spent half of the time getting nothing done even when there are no distractions and i know what i have to write next and then suddenly it clicks and the productiveartistmode kicks in or like today it doesnt
  then suddenly it clicks and the productiveartistmode kicks in    this is the little bastard right here how do i tie this to a chair and make it get to work  king said half of the battle was showing up and i have been just like you but its so frustrating when my brain doesnt want to turn over and start
closing in on it fuck fuck fuck  this hurts      writing some fantasyhorror bullshit btw  vampires inspired it vampires and westerns    i was stewing over another story about a month before nano started then i jumped ship and boarded the novel train with nothing but an vague idea under my belt and a prayer
    im at 40k bitch  yessssss    im going to bed im beat  see yall tomorrow
what are you going to do with the final product are you going to self publish on amazon
  send it to every publishing house i can find before giving up after countless rejection letters and self publishing on amazon
  sending to publishers  dont do this do some research everyone today needs an agent all of the publishers that you want to be contracted to dont even accept nonagented manuscripts write a query letter and send it out to any agent mildly interested in your type of story then give up after countless rejection letters and self publish on amazon
  sit on it for a while before a proper hard edit send it to agents maybe try again     self publishing never i wouldnt shill well and ive got no interest in vanity editions
anyone else doing the exact daily amount daily  reading everyone elses input even my friends makes me feel like im the odd one out
  2k guy here its about a moreorless failed writer getting dragged on a trip by an interdimensional bounty hunter and general fixer at times its a political thriller at others a lovecraftian hellscape
  cool but once you present two related timelines with contrasting mcs the twist would pretty much be guessed by most readers
i was looking into writing a new series and i kept hearing women bitch about theres not enough strong/female/black protagonists in stories i can write anything so i said fuck it and plotted a multibook sci fi adventure series with a young black female protagonist and a cast of 90 females without mentioning the forced/internet/3rd wave feminism that seems to be ruining a lot of recent books/star wars films the story actually works out pretty well without coming across as disingenuous or feeling like it caters to a certain group it just is what it is well see
  90 female cast sounds as unrealistic as the usual dick fest cancer whats the instory reason for most men dying
47k words  just about to enter the third act  
  its not a huge cast    1 adventurous girl  2 middle aged warrior type woman  3 robot no gender  4 an older woman survived an attack by putting her own brain removed with an auto doc to then put it in what looks like a bubbling jar atop a 1950s style clunky robot a la original lost in space in time she has an identity crisis when the change gets to be too much and shell have trouble coping  5 an eyeball atop tentacles type alien that uses bipedal power armor its female and with brood  6 a fizban/obi wan/gandalf/ type older dude  7 tons of faceless enemies both male and female firefight fodder  8 mcs best friend sidekick and anchor to old life kinda looks like merida from brave  main big bad is a mass changing woman bent on killing the heroes  see mass master from the comic book powerpack crossed with the alien queen chick from that game starcraft she leads a band of scifi legion of doom types but all their supposed superpowers are based on actual science     the genders of the characters really doesnt mean squat except for the eyeball alien who is actually giving birth  you could seriously flip a coin on sex but its the conflicts of the characters that are whats most important trying to steer clear of a standard heroes journey template to work with more layers been there done that not looking to retrace steps
  6 a fizban/obi wan/gandalf/ type older dude  aww what a missed opportunity the old male mentor dude is such a tired cliche though i guess its somehow balanced out by the middle aged warrior woman    though the rest sounds aight assuming the antagonist has some decent reason to go for the cast mass changing powers sure sound fun to fuck around with specially in a more visual medium
why is everyone writing genre fiction lol
  old dude is gravely wounded in the opener and sticks around to give mc excalibur in the form of an engineers gauntlet which he created as a young man when building the utopian space station the mc grew up in its something like a science based swiss army knife for building but if tinkered with it becomes a multiweapon for the mc to use i googled and youtubed most dangerous chemicals and substances to find the most volatile shit you might not want used against you and then reworked it for a scifi effect if you ignite chlorine triflouride and push it through a   pressurized tine youve got a flame thrower that burns at 2400 degrees  do the same with liquid helium and youve got a freeze ray  if you line small cartridges withteflon you can keep flouroantimonic acid rounds that seriously act like alien/xenomorph acid and eats through anything  its all real science but if you saw the boring descriptions off and bend a minor rule or two youve got some fun shit to play with   theres also silicone based lifeforms white holes time dilation interstellar movie and a host of other things  im at 30k words should be done by valentines day
  oh and before people start yelling infinity gauntlet its actualy closer to that game dead space with all the nuts and bolts instead of wish fulfillment
  because us genre fiction writers can manage to not neck ourselves before finishing a novel unlike the perpetually disenfranchised perpetually depressed perpetually uninteresting literary fiction writers 
  there are more than just the two viewpoints theyre just the main viewpoints and the way i wrote it makes everything clear because i wanted it to be but any similarities arent distinct within the actual text that being said as i said here  the difficulty starts once the loss of memory  powers idea is explained itll likely be obvious to anyone looking deeper than surface level
  because any genre is just a marketing gimmick so might as well go for one that offers the best commercial opportunities
    i was doing the daily initially but i realized i that i had missed a few days because i jumped into the challenge after it had started  so i wrote more to catch up  add in some blocked/ dryspell days where nothing came to me and i was pretty much obligated to go balls to the wall for wordcount
    you act like i have a choice
    i need to edit the hell out of it  and then possibly illustrate it so it cant go anywhere except my desk for a little while
  i kept hearing women bitch    tumblr and the outoftouch media machine that reports on their freakshow dont represent women at all  you got memed  hope you can make some quickbux off your story though if you can get someone on /co/ to draw a cartoon cover for you you might be able to get some traction around the internet  one of those robots better be trans too or youre dead meat
    im going in for 5k today too  let me off this wild ride
  too bad  youre going to end up writing more novels there is no way off
    anon pls _
  the robot identifies as both a ham sandwich and a tire iron so everyone can just cool their jets
  ham sandwich    kek
earlier in contest plenty of time/ words ahead  writing is ok at best  got slack now on a tight deadline have shitloads of words to go  writing my best work ever
only two days left  hope you niggas are writing
  no can do home slice im drinking tonight  then again ive got less than 1400 words left to win and ive only just started the third act
  my book is a basically a ripoff of the terror but instead of british sailors trying to navigate the northwest passage its spanish conquistadors in the jungle and instead of a polar bear monster its a jaguar monster
6k left to go and three more parts i gotta finish writing to have this finished manuscript done    its turning more into a genre fiction novel that an exploration of lost identity so im going to throw a sex scene with a chick with a dick in there somewhere
  aare you me from the future
  i like it already do native tribals play a role
  maybe
  not being drunk constantly while writing  not gonna make it
  what works inspired your story  shitty animes like oreimo eromanga sensei my sister my writer  how long had you been thinking about the story before writing it  about 20 minutes idk i got kinda drunk and rethought my last plan for a story with something more casual and serializable for a noob like me    about 10k words in obv not gonna make it but thats 10k words i didnt have back in october     have a shitty preview of the last thing drunk me wrote i guess
  even if it sounds unlikely go tor it try to get 50k spend every waking moment writing away
    that kids gonna squeal like a pig isnt he
  i dont have nearly enough alcohol to do this  that said lol okay why not im taking til december 12th tho since i didnt start writing this piece until november 12th
    feminine benis    this place gets more and more fun everyday
    well that wasnt the gif i wanted but hey well go with that
  you know theres actually a guy writing his novel about a futa robot right  its me 
    lewd    carry on
  proceed
    theres only two lewd scenes
  did you just assume my alcoholism
    well now what will i do with my time _  i want to read lewd stories not craft one of my own  tfw procrastinating on your own work    i gguess i could always get back to writing
  i started incredibly late and have not really been sticking to the 1600 words a day rule i have however been writing every day and im going to finish it within a couple of days at least i kind of fucked myself in a way because what it is technically is a sequel to an idea that i have yet to write so the early part is just godawful and going to need the most editing of the entire novellai mean honestly the entire thing is godawful but im learning a fucking lot from just vomiting words onto the paper    the inspirations are stuff like parker daniel boone mysteries dennis lehane genre shit    i thought about it for two months not every hour of every day but just a vague idea i sat down and started writing in the middle of november
  were almost there boys one final effort im at about 47k right now  my story was inspired by my buds and some silly shit we did for talk like a pirate day some dumb jokes and warcraft kinda has the same sort of tech and magic vibe going  i came up with the villain first probably a couple weeks prior to the start of november then i came up with the story around him  its time for a story about pirates magic bullshit and a cowboy  tfw you think of the perfect opportunity to make a parallel to the opening in the epilogue
  parallel to the opening in the epilogue  its usually cheesy but damn if i dont always love it
  this sounds real fun i want to read it
smash out 5k words today  only 85k left to write and two days to do it  gonna make it lads get hype
  thnks bby  hava a shitty flashback/dream as well
ill start sprinting the last 1400 words  after this coffee or maybe this and the next one
got this in an email from a published friend of mine looks like last years nanowrimo work may quickly bear fruit yet lads
  keep it up brotherman youve got this    i love making callbacks to the opening with my endings in my shorter works but this is the first time ive hit it this hard with such a similar sentence feels good and i love the cheese a lot
  congrats anon thats the dream right there
validated with 30 more words than what libreoffice counted    still not done with the third act were going to be at 52k or more during the climax and post climax sex scene
should i stay home and write or go out and get laid anons    ps its a sf dystopian interstellar travel short story and the girl is asian
  have you reached the goal go out not yet get those fingers on the keyboard
  oh and inspired by pkd lies inc recent read
  ill get to typing then maybe i can do both have about 5k words written lmao
  getting laid doesnt take that long unless youre one some stuff
    for inspiration or to get in the mood
  but what if my book isnt about pirates vikings or cowboys
  maybe it has a character that is mentally ill and thinks hes a pirate viking or cowboy
im going to take the day off tomorrow ive already validated for 50k i want to go fishing
  whats your story about
  a fisherman
  a gay romance between a boy and his werewolf
4k words left  have to go to work  will only have a couple of hours after i finish work to complete the novel  gonna be a close one lads wish me luck
accidentally spent all night writing code instead of writing literature  never gonna make it  on the plus side my program is now infinitely better on the downside i feel depressed like i did nothing productive wat do
  squeezed in another 1k in 20 minutes  im feeling it
  
i wanted to write a story about a depressed guy who decides to write a story in an attempt to not be depressed but he fails and so did i
  meta
  maybe the final version will be about the guy writing a story about a depressed guy    no ill probably finish my nonromance story first
  listen to the hymn of the high seas vol 1 album in the background while writing my pirate book  one of the characters is a cowboy type  as soon as he started taking a prevalent role in the chapter the wild west songs started playing  fucking pottery
done so this is five eighths of a minimum publishable novel length
  edgy kid falls in love with an alien grill who ate his crush    still over 4k to go until midnight 
i did it lads 50127 words thats one third of this turkey done
  well done multiple anons actually carrying something through here
  cos its the last day i want to say i pushed myself to write more this month wasnt participating because long work hours and gf and i got 13k words done over three chapters im proud of pushing myself despite not nanoing and hope you all are as well
  mean to say proud of yourselves
  they want their work to be read 
post your final score i guess
  i still got like 3 hours on the clock but im only 350 words away so i guess ill make it
  hit 50k on the head
  and done
only two more scenes to write and im done one sex scene and one deleuzian deterritorialized mental breakdown
  whats the line between genre and literary fiction anyway theres plenty of books considered literary fiction that also fall firmly into established genres
ahhhhhh
tfw wrote a novel  cant tell my friends and family about it because the main character is a futa sexbot
  tfw wrote a novel before a family member whos a 6 year english grad and who has tried at least three times before  cant brag about it because my novel is a gay romance between a werewolf and a twink
  my sister is exactly the same but with a ya novel the description is crazier than my own novels  set in small town australia literally every character is some variant of poc female noncis  town is filled with mythological creatures from every culture on the planet just trying to live their lives but whitey keeps interfering   her hair is as dyed as you think it is
  ugh  this kinda makes me want to dunk on my own family member by stealing their latest novel idea for some totes mcscrotes hard sci fi shenanigans
i finished 50k words in what appears to be partly a novel but mostly the inner rantings of a nighomniscient lesbian in a future fantasy world at least it meant i could just write whatever i want without worrying about coherency so much
post your stories niggas
  how are we going to do this anyway just upload our stories somewhere and post feedback here theres like 5 or 6 finished novels thats a lot of reading desu
  people are fast readers on this board lad  otherwise they arent /lit/
  in a day or so i may have won nano but im not finished with the actual story yet
dont let this thread die you havent given me your novels yet
well i may have failed miserably but i now have 10k words i did not have before        go check out our thread on their site click the profiles of those who won maybe theyll share
what works inspired your story  ministry of utmost happiness  gravitys rainbow  when breath becomes air  how long had you been thinking about the story before writing it  about half a year there are themes in these books that really resonate with me but i want to explore a different angle with them couldnt find any books similar to what i as thinking about so i figured id try to write something short myself to see if i can
  those books are an interesting mix whats your novel about
  i thought we were going to self publish them on amazon and get scrooge mcduck rich from the royalties
  only if youre better at shilling than at writing
  sweet any chance you post an extract
throwing down an extract    
   protagonist is named connie
      its not really fleshed out yet     what struck me the most about ministry was how the characters developed off one another i liked that a lot gr had a lot of scathing criticism about decadence and one of my favorite things there is when slothrop walks through the countryside alone and eventually disappears into the woods to prevent anything controlling him but himself at least how i interpreted it from breath i was immensely moved stoicism in the face of mortality     what ive got so far a man finds out hes dying of a terminal disease and relocates from the city to a small northern town he wants to die on his own terms he contrasts with some of the townsfolk who idolize urban lifestyles as he always idolized a quiet life in the woods somewhere the story begins with extremely bleak overtones and slowly grows brighter thematically in juxtaposition with his declining health     i only have a couple pages so far ive never tried to write anything before so im afraid of it being unoriginal or insincere so i can only really work on it when a particular mood strikes
  heres one from mine     for reference pandora is a robot maggie is a mechanic  names are not my strong suit
so nanowrimo decided that i actually wrote 50k words but i obviously didnt wat do
   you won    what did you win
  congrats on your 50k
  
  if steven universe if your first thought when a character is named connie then it speaks more about you than him
  that was great you going to post the whole thing
has anyone here been published
  in previous threads there was one guy who said he was after writing 5 or so books he wrote
  does amazon count
  i meant traditionally but if youve self published im also interested in hearing about it      thanks
handwriterfag i expect to see your work posted here even if you need to take pictures of the pages
  disappointment and guilt
    i too would like to read an excerpt   holy moly you lads are exceptional i never even got to finish on time
    not me   but then thats the future goal
  im the guy from the previous threads heres a general post i made about the process  and the responses give more specifics did you have any questions
  did you have any questions  not atm thanks for the link ill read through your posts and replies my goal is to be traditionally published but i havent even completed my first novel so im not making a serious attempt anytime soon im feeling like reading about someones experiences with it
sent excerpts to guy  guy said hed read and edit my writing long before nano  admitted today that he wasnt interested in novel  okay youre allowed not to like things if you dont like things you can still give constructive criticism  admitted that he hasnt read anything ive written  admitted that he hasnt even read the excerpts ive sent him  admitted the only reason he was pretending to read my stuff was to get a schadenfreude like sense of accomplishment i had fun exploring the writing process and we accomplished and created things    dont ever put out posts asking for anons to read your work and expect even semiserious constructive criticism at this point im one novel and a fapfic and a half into not knowing what they criticized in good faith and what they were giving half assed criticism or just shitposting at me
  thanks anon actually im still writing but of course the last couple of days i did fuck all despite having free time just because november was over
  giving fake criticism  thats some next level trolling right there
  this will happen frequently unfortunately even with people you meet irl but the worst is people who pretend they have read it and they say yeah i liked it and are unable to answer a single question because they only read the beginning i have had friendships end because i just want them to admit they are lying and they refuse but then theyre unable to tell me a single thing that happened past the first few pages then in the next breath say it was really good idk what else you want me to say  fuck people can be frustrating i love when people say i read the first few pages and its not really my type of book because thats all i even prefer unpublished pseuds who buy my book and send me emails ripping it apart to idiots who pretend to read stuff theyre the absolute worst
since noone else is posting their full story heres mine completed unedited so theres probably a lot of minor grammar and spelling errors  
  top lad ill read through it eventually probably
any good books on writing ik the nano is over but im gonna try to write a couple short stories this month but i dont think i have the skill for it yet
whoooo i sold one book on amazon self publishing
  and it wasnt a family member or friend
  when did you publish it have you done any shilling      ive heard good things about on writing by stephen king i havent read it
   family member  no im too embarrassed to shill to my mom or dad     friend  ahahaha  good joke      i just uploaded it to amazon on november 26 no shilling  ive only sold one copy im no jk rowling
  what genre you can always shill it on reddit or stuff like that i didnt mean a huge marketing campaign congrats btw
  im too shy to tell my own mother to buy my book much less le we did it reddit the genre is foreign language education i suppose i write a series of shitty short stories in a foreign language and then write the english translation so people can learn the foreign language
  well congrats then anon good work
  thank you
  what are the short stories about i dont think that a lot of people are going to buy some random book like yours to learn a language    next book you write just use a pen name
  ive heard that about on writing too forgot about it thanks anon
  i did use a pen name i do agree about the not a lot of people buying the book its not zero though so i keep writing them im also leaning the foreign language myself so it helps me learn the language too if i didnt write the stories i would still have spent a lot of time studying
  i was talking purely from a sales success point of view keep writing anon i believe in you
  yeah one day i need to get over my social anxiety and shill like those people on reddit but until then im safe in my shell
  whoops accidentally posted the clean version this is the full version with sex scenes intact 
  only 4 pages longer  im disappointed anon
  ill add more in revisions
dont die yet thread
  if this thread is still alive by thursday ill shittalk you then
my professor is trying to sell nietzsche to us as this aesthete romantic and misunderstood selfhelp guru who battled valiantly against christian dogma and sacrificed himself in the process i havent done an extensive study of nietzsche but i cant help but feel that this is missing a lot of the details of his work and how truly bad he thought everything was before he came to realization of how good it was its almost like hes painting him as a hedonist is this a good interpretation of the moustached man
  no fuck you and your professor nietzsche is a disease plain and simple
  just nod your head and agree with whatever your education commissioner i mean professor says anon
  pretty gay takes desu
  7s confirm   also im a big neech fan but i stopped myself from responding in a my dad will beat up your dad sort of way
  you are right to be suspicious is your teacher also failing to note that much of nietzsches criticism of christianity stems from the fact that it is a judeo faith the slave morality that is pervasive in christianity is just an extension of jewish morality which is the original slave morality nietzsche is quite plain about this but when i was taught him in class the professor rather conveniently skipped over all of the antisemitic stuff
  how in the hell can you be a fan of a man like that i am asking a genuine question because it baffles me how so many people can fall into his trap
postkaufmann sanitizing of nietzsche    best thing you can do is just read nietzsche his voice comes through loud and clear hes more powerful than your professor
  i doubt he would go over this
  im not a fan of his philosophy per se but of the style in which he renders it i find it poetic also i used to get beat up a lot and use the mantra of life affirmation to work through the trauma
  that seems to be the universal appeal to him everyone can get on board if theyve suffered and every fucking body suffers so everyone can get a piece of the nietzsche pie he is not empowering not lifeaffirming definitely not courageous and by all means a weak effeminate nutcase who could conceal vapid meanings behind pretty words
  christian dogma  is he american why is it always americans who think some meme about their outlier christians limited to their country are representative of that time and place urbanite european christians of nietzsches time were all libertine borderline atheists painting christian dogma as oppressive with progression winning out is literally stock christian dogma and culture secularised also he shits on those aforementioned libertines and hedonists too
  cant really argue with this haha i think it will be a while before i can meanginfully overcome my own angst however so i will continue to seek refuge in the nietzschean tradition     my own intepretation of his approach is that even were to overcome his own angst he would plunge himself back into the realm of disquiet in order to guide his future readers through their own internal conflict to dismiss him as merely a nutcase is i feel a bit premature
  he is not empowering  blatantly false most of his philosophy is based on the overman which is made into being by enmpowering yourself  not lifeaffirming  also blatantly false he teaches that life and earthlove is one of the greatest things man can aspire to  definitely not courageous  see part 1 most of his philosophy is based off of oversoming yourself which takes courage  and by all means a weak effeminate nutcase who could conceal vapid meanings behind pretty words  lmao maybe you should actually read nietzsche start with thus spoke zarathustra then move updates
  also he shits on those aforementioned libertines and hedonists too  where does he do this
  up
  he is a waste of time who should be hated with every ounce of being he is the last thing preventing any of you shitheads from actually doing something
  t christian who unironically thinks neetschee is a nihilist
  he was the one to get me out of christianity in the first place ive spent the better part of my last 3 years reading and rereading everything he wrote letters personal correspondences lesser known works even
  checked    i wonder who is behind this post
  anyone who uses nietzsche as an excuse for inaction has made the mistake of reading nietzsche in a very cursory fashion
  ive spent the better part of my last 3 years reading and rereading everything he wrote letters personal correspondences lesser known works even  appeal to experience not an argument
  if your the one who wrote  then youve got more rereading to do
  youre absolutely right holy shit i didnt construct an argument and i imagine if i did it would be filled with fallacies and more weak assertions but when all is said and done the very idea of being a nietzschean or a fan of his is selfdefeating
    youre both very silly and quite dull i hope you will one day learn why you self harm in this way i guarantee one of you will reply in an incoherent artless way to me assuming i am like the other posters in this thread very sad
  ive done all i can do i dont want to spend the rest of my life tied down to his inane lunacy
wait if christians were basically atheist in germany at the time why did he feel the need to rail against it
  you fucking nitwit if you want to pose as me outstanding at least try to write like i do makes it more believable
  christian dogma is here a synechdoche for all other exigent systems of hierarchic social value from one which one might emancipate himself or herself       read between the lines  hes made a compelling implicit case for why he might not believe nietzsche to be a nihilist youd only have to read the first half of maxims and arrows i have you now nihilists to stop unironically believing nietzsche to be a dogmatic nihilist
  thank you i sincerely hope that for everyones readings of nietzsche they can finally say to hell with him and move the fuck on to something new
  youre welcome a devils advocate might say that even nietzsche would have the same hope for his readers however
to me nietzsche means absolutely nothing
  thats what i believe i dont think it was for no good reason that he had zarathustra say now i bid you lose me and find yourselves
  rail against it  what did he rail against the moral doctrine and history namely some laughable shit about slave morality which i think holds very little weight but the sentiment is relevant morality as a continual product of history remains regardless to this day it remains even in libertines and the most revolutionary rejections of ones culture/society     basically atheist in germany  yes christianity has been on the path of diluting god into some overarching force then into an impartial physical law and then into nonexistence god or no god or that and this god the culture and morality embedded still remain
  why is it always americans who think some meme about their outlier christians limited to their country are representative of that time and place  painting christian dogma as oppressive with progression winning out is literally stock christian dogma and culture secularised    you answered your own question right there
  based hoellu
  my professor is trying to sell nietzsche to us as this aesthete romantic and misunderstood selfhelp guru who battled valiantly against christian dogma and sacrificed himself in the process  thats pretty spoton except for the selfsacrifice bit    i havent done an extensive study of nietzsche but i cant help but feel that this is missing a lot of the details of his work and how truly bad he thought everything was before he came to realization of how good it was  youre a stupid idiot listen to your professor
  nietzsche is nietzsche
      antisemitic
why dont you just fuckin read nietzsche anyway since his shit is tight no matter what your professor thinks of him
  this youre paying for credentials just go through with all the shit until you get what you came for
nietzsche was an invention of wagner he never existed
how can i mentally disassociate nietzsches free spirits from stirners ego
  dont know if it can honestly be done stirner was the first to philosophize with a hammer
  true nobodys put reality back together quite the same way since
  stirner is cain    after the flood moses had to unravel the will of god and build upon it the morality of the commandments     stirner kills this because he can for he has free will
s closest friends and other people near to him were perplexed no one could remember ever having heard the name of stirner from nietzsches mouth there are dozens of letters in the archives that bear witness to the confusion of his friends they understood well enough why nietzsche had been publicly silent about stirner but why did he given his habitual communicativeness overbeck never mention him even in the most familiar circles only overbecks wife ida remembered in 1899 a discussion she had with nietzsche about twenty years earlier during which he unintentionally let escape the remark that he felt a mental kinship to stirner this was accompanied by a solemn facial expression while i attentively observed his features these changed again and he made something like a dispelling dismissive movement with his hand and spoke under breath well now i have told you even though i did not want to speak of it forget about it they would talk about a plagiarism but you will not do that im sure
stirnerfags should kill themselves
  distill it
  i think this may be a fabrication born from the assumption that nietzsche is tied to stirner which was seemingly commonplace from the getgo less known now he most likely is but the belief that he is was more of a meme so that i doubt any evidence of the time
all of them
all of them
all of them
      based
why are women so stupid
  because they arent men
  true true you make a good point

  which one      it seems to be about an elderly couple
  yes a wandering knight joins their party along the way
motherfucker if you actually read don quixote you wouldnt need to be asking this question
  im reading sir gawain and the green knight for a major project about knights right now if you havent read it you should definitely try it
tirant lo blanc  palmerim of england  amadis de gaula  these are the books that in don quijote didnt get burned  the faerie queene
orlando furioso too
morte darthur is exactly what youre looking for
not really a knight dragoon but noone talks about von grimmelshausens the adventures of simplicius simplicissimus its a morbid yet charming tale set during the thirty years war written by a veteran the book is partly autobiographical penguin classics paperback version is by far the best
ivanhoe
  parzival
candide
  lmort darthur is the big boy version it has all the stories
  which one he says
check out the white company great book
briennes story in asoiaf but maybe song of roland french vs muslims
blood meridian but has cowboys instead
nibelungenlied a german classic
  looks stupid
    read chivalry by leon gautier its great on the tradition and the bibliography will be a goldmine for you
the second part of don quixote

i get an obscure feeling whenever i scroll up and down /lit/ board  not just only scroll but read and  i geniuely feel the world is over the whole culture collapsed everything is over and anons here are those who survived who paid attention is things that matter but not  vanity    holy crap
holy
damn never thought of it that way
  is this an elaborate ruse everyone here is pretty much pic related
  ding ding but no its not a trick
people on this webzone are so vain that they posture over books they pretend to have read anonymously thats right they are trying to gain social credit with posts that can never be connected to any other one they post or them as a personthe only person they could possibly be posturing to is themselves every single thread on a book will include a greentext on the book name attached with a disgusted looking harold bloom who they of course havent read thats how people argue here they just post a smug ohh i cant believe youd read something like that or snicker you actually think that with no context im convinced that no one has actually read a book on this board theyve just memorized names and face and vague ideas associated with them and just bounce the same baseless conceptions back and forth with each other until it forms a board wide gestalt consciousness of pseud like someone here could show you the most obscure portrait of kant looking like a negrogoblin a wacky anecdote about coffee or his masturbation habits but ask them anything about his actual philosophy and you will get total silence ask about an entrylevel book total silence ask about a basic grammar concept total silence ask which author had the biggest forehead 100 replies with the most bitter arguments imaginable how anybody could think this place the last bastion of literary culture is unimaginable this is the theoretical zeropoint of intelligent discussion on the internet
can i read dg without first reading marx
  you can but itd be pretty pointless
if you want im not going to stop you
youd just end up having to backtrack so much that you would wish youd read marx first
ugh fine kills myself
  now youre gettin it youll be approaching the bwo in no time
  just marx isnt it possible but not without freud marx kant and neetche
  have read the other two
  yes
  yes dont read marx
what the fuck was his problem
  lookin like a bagel
probably missed his old glasses
  too based to be stopped  his only mistakes were not writing more elaborately and believing meme science of his time
  this
hegel is a charlatan who conceived the now pervasive philosophical prion
  virgin will vs chad absolute   no wonder people ignored his classes
  based hegel was probably closer to a pantheist or cosmic optimist or something schop was just a assblasted defeatist with mommy issues who probably didnt even buy the black pills he was selling
  sometimes i wonder if people like you have even read a single original sentence of schopenhauer or hegel
  he was so passionate about speculative reason he forgot to actually exist
  who the fuck is that
be good or kys
imagine being a roman emperor and your wife still cucks you imagine writing a whole book just to cope
  a book which basically all selfhelp books are based on
which edition of kants critique of pure reason on amazon should i get not new to philosophy so just hit me with it
either pluhar hackett or guyer cambridge  id usually tell people to get the cheapest one possible but right now theyre both being sold for 35 on amazon  if you plan on reading the two other critiques i suggest you to get them from the same publisher
guyer/cambridge definitely    you can go back and read nks or muller for fun later but for your first time around you should read the current authoritative
come now you know its true
just get the dover edition and save your money i only regret wordsworth dont have one out
reviving for different question    do you guys have luck with the collected works books or should i skip and get separate books    not specifically for kant actually looking at dostoevsky but for any philosopher really
        should i prioritize reading the first edition is that in the cambridge one
      cambridge
  dostoevsky and kant both wrote lots of different books that have different moods feelings philosophical questions addressed by them  dostoevskys demons is just vaguely related to notes from the underground  likewise outside of his critical system kants works have very little in common amongst themselves his metaphysics of morals has very little in common with his religion within the bounds of bare reason except by virtue of being related to the critique of practical reason and the critique of judgement  just because you mightve enjoy reading one it doesnt mean youll want to read the rest of em
  the guyer and most kant editions include both the socalled a and b editions of the cpr integrated into one another    guyer handles it by simply synthesising the sections that are mostly the same noting changes/differences in the footnotes and also noting subsections that were added in the b edition via footnote and for the parts that differ drastically between a  b it simply includes both the prefaces/intros mostly
  both the cambridge and the hackett editions have text from the two editions put one against the other  theyre slightly different in certain regards but not too much so as to seem like completely different works you should definitively read both but when in doubt about something id suggest you consult the second edition over the first one
all hail the divine plato    pin this thread if you support neoplatonism and understand the esoteric interpretation of plato and have been fully initiated into the mystery cults    hide this thread if you support the monstrous abortion that is modern philosophy and think philosophy consists of sophism and word games rather than preparing for death    reply if you wish to engage in peaceful dialogue and shary comfy feels regarding knowledge of the forms at this late/early hour
  based and platopilled thread modern philosophy cant compete
im finishing a scifi book and then ill head straight into complete plato im excited is it going to be a hard read im kind of a brainlet
  640x480x 256 color vga was the most patrician format prove me wrong
  standard vga was 640x480x16
  could anyone reccomend one of his dialogues besides the republic that deals with the idea that being creates the world
    absolutely based to me plato is not the father or founder of western philosophy he is western philosophy itself the tree on whom all subsequent philosophies have grown as branches
what is argument guys there are many definitions some say that all discourse is argument some say that only valid or sound formulations of logical form can be argument some deny that argument is at all but what the fuck is it even
  based anon has realized that atbottom there exist entities which cannot be defined in terms beyond themselves which we are so familiar with we dont even notice our lack of ability to understand them i have learnt much by following this road let me throw you a few crumbs of wisdom to set you on the right path here are some other concepts which cant be defined except inthemselves  goodness beauty justice etc  ruler/king/queen/etc  fire water earth air  sky mountains trees etc  and many many other entities    reflect on them anon ask yourself the same question of what they are not scientifically but as essences follow this road and someday you will see i cant give you my learnings you have to get it for yourself ill give you a hint nondualism
  timaeus
  there is large variation in the difficulty of the dialogues i would start with the traditional 4 dialogues sometimes called the last days of socrates which goes euthyphro  apology  crito  phaedo these will give you a good taste for the genre
  based thread  please let this become a regular thing
  where do i start with uzdavinys he seems to what ive been looking for
  you dont seem to understand im genuinely curious
  plato  divine  the human being can be divine  you are not doing your homework correctly m8
  orpheus and the roots of platonism is the best intro very moving written at the end of his life similar to kants prolegomena philosophy and theurgy and philosophy as a rite of rebirth are somewhat beyond my ken but worth owning i would also suggest the authors he cites such as hadot and mcevilley and assmann
  dialectic is an encounter by thought with the outside of thought ielove/sex/war/death/rebirth/etc  badiouan deleuzean maoist portato fascist with complete fidelity to the schizo socrates event
  i cant put my finger on why but im very grateful for this post thank you
  you might want a reading guide or not jumping in might be challenging jumping around might be fun neoplatonists promote the timaeus and critias and parmenides as the peak symposium and republic are usually regarded as the most favorite works of classics and philosophy students respectively college classes typically read the trial and death of socrates first euthyphro apology meno and phaedo
  then continue to be so

  it reaffirms the mystery of life the fact that over two thousand years later we still cant explain these core yet abstract concepts proves that there are some things that feel as if they are beyond the minds comprehension why do we draw blanks when attempting to explain these handles you can give examples but you cant truly capture what it is it is almost as if by defining something we put it in a box and isolate it we cant wrap our minds around certain qualities they are too big for our minds to corral them following this line of thought deeper down the rabbits hole makes you realise some pretty peculiar things about the way we think and the nature of reality and the self
  i read a lot of plato and i like everything he has to say except the bit about art as mere imitation i think plotinus has a better idea there  how do i go about understanding the esoteric implications of his ideas
  i cant answer it for you other than tell you that you have the answers already      youre welcome friend for your kind words ill give you a few more  purity  freedom  cuteness  humor  dream  number  love  emotion sadness anger and all others  noses eyes teeth lips hair hands and any other physical features  temperature  texture    simply ask yourself the question of what these are again not in their scientific definitions but what they are to you the one observing them      the anon here claims the mystery of life but i ask you anon what is mystery mystery is itself a mystery isnt it and yet can this be can one speak of a concept at all here mystery without one already knowing what it is     as i have said nondualism holds your and the other anons answers both plato and advaita have the answers which are both nondualist but from different angles you must reflect on what ive just told you on your own im sure youll come to where i have in enough time just as i did
  christ is the form of the good
  philosophy is about preparing for death  ive never been able to articulate this but have always felt it
  seconding
  this implies plato was human
  any good secondary literature on the forms im very unsure of my understanding of the idea but it seems to me that distinct forms emerge as a result of the space between matter and the contrast that this distance provides    also esotericism is a big gay borderline headcanon
foucault is better than plato
  delet
what works should i read for a basic understanding and/or introduction to plato
  he was
  reading plato by szlezak
  jesus christ just read it why do you need someone to dumb it down for you
  do as  more crudely said and simply read his dialogues directly anon his work is presented very accessibly its merely that the concepts themselves are so profound that one can and likely will contemplate them for a lifetime after the concepts thenselves however are not difficult to grasp in a basic sense youll have plenty of resources afterward to serve as commentary but you should first read him directly they arent simply expositions theyre plays and have dramatic elements in them as well which need to be read directly
  no evidence for that in fact all the evidence suggests otherwise
  this the general scientific consensus is that he was indeed divine     fun fact dante in his inferno placed plato in the first circle of hell because he was a virtuous pagan but not a christian even though he lived before the time of christ lol
thanks for this thread op
  platos mother was pregnant of apollo and forbid his father to make love to her the muses brought honey to his mouth when he was a child to signify that he was going to speak incredible truths he was the brother of the medicine god asclepius send from apollo to humans to tend their souls

  and have been fully initiated into the mystery cults    how can you consider yourself a platonist in the fullest sense if the initiatic chain of these mystery cults has been severed for a thousand plus years and you completely lack a basis for any sort of theurgy   the only things left of these traditions in themselves are the texts and the philosophy they taught was in no way meant to be confined to reading books and thinking about things on a purely virtual level
  i think he meant it metaphorically as in being a metaphorical member of such cults
  this is true but you must start somewhere and the texts are as good a place as any

now that which everliveth differs from the eternal for he hath not been brought to being by another and even if he have been brought to being he hath not been brought into being by himself but ever is brought into being
i just got the complete works and started it planning to get through some of it during the christmas break but at a nice slow pace     so far ive read euthyphro apology phaedo crito and theaetetus and the prose and arguments are actually easier to follow than i expected with minor exceptions where socrates makes linguistic jokes that dont translate into english theyre explained in the footnotes though     its amazing how much stuff still feels relevant practical and useful to analyze today especially the ideas about justice and the social contract in phaedo so far
  id say start with the symposium and the phaedrus they are great reads and introduce some interesting concepts also read the apology if youre interested in it then you can probably tackle the republic and youve got yourself a basic introduction of some dialogues and platos most important work      absolutely retarded answer how much of value do you think a new reader would retain from simply reading platos complete works from beginning to end as  state without grasping reading plato can very well be a undertaking of a lifetime and theres no point in rushing into it
    undertaking of a lifetime  
how do you stop yourself from becoming a pseud as you read more and more books  seems like the temptation is always there to think youre smarter than you really are  i dont wanna become like one of those rddit euphorics who type out entire paragraphs trying to seem smart when their entire post always boils down to communism good capitalism bad magic sky daddy not real
start by deleting all your frog pictures
you have a real job at the same time and remember reading too much is bad      this also
  this
  reading the bible and be humble would be a good start
  do any of you that post this actually think that pepe is going to disappear any time soon
  by far one of the most pseud things ive ever read forsaking authenticity of expression for ease of acceptance doubly so when said sincerity is readily marked against you is the very essence of being a thought faggot
  what are some good books in the bible related to humility
  thoughtless
  frog  pseud  what
  say what you want about frogposters but i generally dont think of them as pseuds
  theres nothing sincere or authentic about reaction images of any kind
  this
  they contain tremendous nuance that is the very nature of art to better express something than words alone maybe you fail to appreciate the niceties involvedbeing a pseud
  its generalization you moron the opposite of nuance
  only pseuds complain about frog posting  literally every single poster that has ever complained about it has been a fucking pseud
  when you post a reaction image youre literally substituting someone elses face for your own its the definition of inauthenticity  at most youre showing everyone what designated meme clique you belong to
  btfo    /thread
  except you choose from a vastness of images and you use then in accompaniment with words which are used to distill the nuance of the image imagine ops post without the frog just the words it doesnt have nearly the same effect at the same time lots of posts using the same image dont have the same effect either
  youre dumb  any example other than the frog could maybe help your point but the addition of an image is mostly just for flavor
  you expand on this statement
  seems like the temptation is always there to think youre smarter than you really are  when you read a lot the exact opposite happens    go read now

  how do you stop yourself from becoming a pseud as you read more and more books  the whole point of reading is to become more self assured in your new role as a pseud
  why is pepe so hated
  unironically start with the greeks   read platos apology crito and phaedo
  no it doesnt even make sense how does frog posting  pseud  youre a fucking retard /thread
          why do pseuds hate pepe so much do they think it makes them look smart
  its impossible we all read because were pseuds   we read because we want to feel smarter than our peers who dont read reading is for pseuds      fucking pseud
  how do you stop yourself from becoming a pseud as you read more and more books  follow xunzis advice  to volunteer information when you have not been asked is called officiousness to answer two questions when you have been asked only one is garrulity both officiousness and garrulity are to be condemned

  lesbian
  the entire series was a christmas present from a misguided family member i read it because of a sense of obligation but also being ignorant to what it was i should have stopped i really really should have but i finished it
  its a joke trying to get someone to ask what is ligma usually by saying someone has ligma and when they ask the reply is ligma balls it sounds like lick my balls
  why do reddit/goodreads plebs get so mad when you suggest that their teenage romances arent very good
use the lword  body of work  l a r d
  its really just down to personal preference if i like ya genre fiction  but it literally is
  literally yes intellectually not so much
  i read the whole thing when i was younger but had never seen what the author looks like until just now and honestly i feel violated
  i cant tell if my sarcasm went over your head or your sarcasm is now going over mine
  same reason people get mad on here if you shit on a work they like
whats the problem op she does have a very impressive if not massive body of work

  youre even worse than op for enabling this pseud behavior
  hes not crazy just disgustingly pretentious this is what happens when you dont discipline your kids during their developmental years they never learn how to not embarrass themselves

should post this on /x/ theyd appreciate it
okay but what about the lemurians
  lemurians are the dissipative white potency a white hole would be a lemurian aeon but that might be stretching it id hardly associate bataille and lands thought with gnostic aeons
  hes not pretentious if you actually grasp what hes trying to say the only reason people get annoyed by his posts is because most of it flies over their heads
  comparing this to timecube is just dumb
  who on earth is comparing this to timecube

  also anon have you ingested psychedelics in your life
  the image of thought is deleuzes characterisation of what comes before thinking that which philosophy implicitly presupposes and explicitly projects a prephilosophical and natural and hence dogmatic image of what thinking is the dogmatic image supposes that what thought wants wants both materially and wilfully is the true morality leads us to presuppose this it is presupposed in the sense that everybody knows what it means to think as though it were common sense we all have this common picture of what it means to think its an image in which subject and object and being and beings are already assigned their proper place and relation one to the other and so long as philosophy holds to this image it does not matter what it goes on to think conceptually if the image of thought guides the creation of concepts then those concepts will be part of the same image projected moreover it is the supposition of a natural capacity to think in this way that permits philosophy to claim to begin without suppositions it is a supposition which is endowed with the power to undercut the conditions of the present moment and its attendant perversions
  can i get a tl dr on this pls
  what happens inside black holes directly corresponds to what ccru thinks is the logical consequence of western history the complete subjugation of time and reality to technology the singularity  or oneness  of the universe is both what creates it and what sits at the end of its development reproduced technologically as the omega point  western thought is just the process by which it gets there    then its compared to schellings doctrine of the potencies the two fundamental principles of the god the negative contractive force and an expansive lifegiving one systole and diastole the former is the motor of the western dialectic and the principle of selfhood because schelling compares it to the original dark inwardness of the godhead completely selfimmersed selfswallowing which bangs into a universe but ultimately returns in another shape through western philosophy of identity there also some parallels with freud here the death of the obscene father who haunts the symbolic order as its principle and outside    the latter force is what lands thrown his chips in with and also the principle of otherness alterity not difficult to see why land would it is the rejection of totalizing identity of the subsumption of difference into transcendental conditioning structures and ultimately of the entire western enterprise itself the black is the system the white are the termites that want to drag it back into the soup the roil heat death chaos what have you    basically ageold dualities manifesting themselves cosmologically technologically and historically
  yes      no
based what is your comparative take on badiou have you got the chance to check out the final installment of his system the immanence of truths
  besides the basics ive honestly never really engaged with the guy but hes on the list i didnt know he released a new book care to talk about it anon
  i havent either but thought you may have just havd read rudas article on him and hegel and from his own books pocket pantheon which was garbage
  can you link the article are you the guy trying to read the dash i stole the time is the mouth that eats itself line from that kek
  yeah   its in this paper collection  
  i can agree with a  a
  iq 115 things the problem is maldigestion of other peoples thoughts and magical thinking that isnt quite controlled at that intelligence level
  i think youre confusing style for maldigestion nevertheless id like to hear you expand on this magical thinking      based thanks

  im really happy to see this thanks    basically what im trying to do is articulate a way out of the globalistaccelerationist impasse a middle way between collapse and full throttle which of course bend into a horseshoe     i wont sit here and tell you im on the cusp of the next kantian breakthrough because theres something obscenely hubristic about that not to mention its not something im really aiming for or capable of but i will tell you that my hearts just not really in either the posthuman sounds more and more like the antihuman these days or humanism proper though im definitely sympathetic to the cosmotech aesthetic and mode of thought you see here on /lit/ which im very happy to contribute to in my own small way there is power here    with what limited cognitive resources allotted to me i want to at least accomplish this for myself and in myself even if the world never hears a peep and it honestly probably never will    i use stellar imagery because the hydrostatic equilibrium that keeps stars together is a perfect balance of the centripetal force of gravity and the centrifugal push of energy radiating outward remember also in kabbalah tifereth represents the balance of cosmic polarities    of course when stars die in the penultimate moment they have to throw their chips in with either one or the other black hole or supernova but wait what about white dwarves what vision of humanitys destiny of technology and the soul of god and mysticism would correspond to the fact that white brown and black dwarves last so long they basically shortcircuit time itself could we use metaphors as a springboard into something new i dont know but so far its clicking together pretty well     ill probably take a hiatus soon and let this all percolate a bit more
    well based you have the heideggerian talent for echolocation     have you seen the light anon
  i think i have friend i think i have
  i mean you could take a bunch of lsd and experience some plotinus shit if you wanted
  i dont doubt that i would honestly just cant find it around here have you done the same /x/tier lsd mysticism is one thing but what are psychedelics like when youve studied philosophy and mysticism as i assume you have
  the
    dank aesthetic who is making these
  you can order it pretty easily from the dark web pay with bitcoin etc strange but true    i dunno how much a difference the reading makes maybe more the temperament of one who would read that etc    anyway by orders of magnitude the most profound experiences ive ever had st teresa and plotinus shit one is not worthy of 
  i know that feeling i always end up betraying that light sooner or later you lose your temper with something or let small petty things occupy your thoughts its hard i know what alchemists mean by the duality of the self
  and now at last the highest truth on this subject remains unsaid probably cannot be said for all that we say is the faroff remembering of the intuition that thought by what i can now nearest approach to say it is this when good is near you when you have life in yourself it is not by any known or accustomed way you shall not discern the footprints of any other you shall not see the face of man you shall not hear any namethe way the thought the good shall be wholly strange and new it shall exclude example and experience you take the way from man not to man all persons that ever existed are its forgotten ministers fear and hope are alike beneath it there is somewhat low even in hope in the hour of vision there is nothing that can be called gratitude nor properly joy the soul raised over passion beholds identity and eternal causation perceives the selfexistence of truth and right and calms itself with knowing that all things go well vast spaces of nature the atlantic ocean the south sea long intervals of time years centuries are of no account this which i think and feel underlay every former state of life and circumstances as it does underlie my present and what is called life and what is called death
  based dishevelled pepe and wojak poster
hey op youre the guy who made the cosmotech threads right or you at least participated in them love your mad energy and your interesting posts you should genuinely consider compiling them    i posted quite a bit in the cosmotechs as well but from a more pragmatist point of view i almost invariably agree with your viewpoints on the subject but as you and others have pointed out numerous times the key here is western thought is the motor driving the singularity forward perhaps the biggest concern for people invested in such a thing is keeping western thought as a thing in the world ie keeping the west western im sure you know what i mean by this it wont be the west much longer if the rest of the world comes to live here and actual westerners and hence their way of life and thoughts are subsumed by nonwesterners and nonwestern thoughts/values/ideals    land himself has made many dogwhistling posts and a few that outright state as much you dont get to a singularity when the average iq is 80 and people have little to no time preference
  how come every single larping schizo types like theyve never heard of a comma before its like theyre intentionally trying to be unintelligible to seem more esoteric and uncomprehensible  pretty gay if you ask me
everyone in this thread    take it to   take it to   take it to   take it to     mods pls relocate thread  op please remain in your containment board
  thats actually girardfag/landposter i wont claim credit for those threads theyve done quite a bit to raise the culture of this board    you make an interesting point i think the westernization of the east is already happening even evola recognized it back in his day they dont necessarily need to come here    the groundwork the philosophical skeleton for a singularity is already here absolutely no doubt about it now it just comes down to momentum whether the system is already going too fast to be slowed down by mongrelization/the threat of dysgenic collapse once gene editing goes mainstream dysgenics/miscegenation will be a nonissue as soon as we can customize biology its ogre then were looking at the monster of genetic segregation pleasure domes that whole nightmare scenario
  looking forward to the next posts anon
      i mean theres a double movement here western technology and lifestyle is saturating the east while the east and middle east etc are getting their tendrils into the west but theres definitely some giveandtake china adopts a brand of capitalism suited to its temperament america subsumes the negroid pleasure drive into its youth culture fueled by ideologized ressentiment       basically the west is only turning into brown slush at ground level the tip of the pyramid is just getting more powerful inscrutable domineering i gotta side with nietzsche here the higher are getting higher the lower are getting lower each side its accelerating into its notion as it were     to sum up i dont think theres really any danger of the west no longer being western as long as the hands on the steering wheel remain white unless the elites themselves join us in committing ethnic suicide doubt it the central command of nuliberalism are not as naive or pathological as their tools that motor will keep on running mongrelization is just the lube dissent getting bred out like a maladaptive trait
  absolutely worth it memes aside im no psychonaut but ive tripped hard enough times to feel that it can render philosophical insight i dont find the value is so much in having philosophical breakthroughs while tripping but more so that you can embody a philosophical system in a way much more visceral than its intellectualized form you experience while studying it on a good trip the world is pure wonder which as we know from artistotle is the origin of all philosophy psychedelics in a way are like forced philosophyby being ejected from its usual conceptual framework as provided by the dominant culture your mind has no choice but to philosophize itself a different system you may end up in buddha or nietzsche or kant maybe even a divine synthesis of all of the above you might not understand anything better afterwards but ive found its given me a wider breadth of phenomenal experience thats made me quicker at identifying the feelings various philosophers are evoking in their concepts     however be careful to resist the temptation during the trip to describe it to yourself in philosophical terms if you are too selfconscious in evaluating it you can find yourself in a precarious place better to let yourself be willingly wiped clean and let the concepts come as they will
  yeah ive noticed weed has the same effect suddenly what these guys are talking about becomes so comprehensible that you kind of realize philosophy 40 language and 60 temperament i dont want to say feeling more like a kind of inner condition drugs can be a shortcut too     im gonna try and find some shrooms
  yeah temperment is a better word its basically the argument nietzsche makes in his book on the presocratics the point of reading another philosopher is not to discover if theyve done better than others about rationalizing their way into thinking of the world in the way that makes the most sense but is instead an attempt to experience a unique worldview for lack of a better term that a philosopher has formed by thinking through the coherences of their lives    good luck on getting shrooms id recommend taking around half an eighth no point in going overboard your first time spending time in the woods and considering heidegger
  as long as the hands on the steering wheel remain white  this is where the issue comes in those hands are either people pretending to be white ie jews or as we see more and more become the case nonwhites who are given the highest tiers of power via quotas in some kind of attempt at restorative justice crap that gets peddled by progressives  i think im overall more blackpilled about our future prospects i suppose i agree that if the hands steering the ship remain western then maybe there wouldnt be an issue ignoring of course that whites will become minorities in their own countries  i dont believe that a people should have to justify their own sovereign existence but those hands are becoming less and less western as time moves on
  well i think the point is whether or not they remain white  whether or not they express some fidelity to a nation or a race  will become irrelevant eventually the car will learn to drive itself see heres the thing i just dont think you can have your hands on the steering wheel of a machine this large and intricate and remain committed to some ethnic stock or some national interest its alienating in its essence whatever color the hands are theyve already pledged themselves to a vector that recognizes nothing certainly not cultural heritage      were headed for a bad time         yeah it really clicked with me when deleuze said comparing philosophers is like comparing painters its about being introduced to a whole different bandwidth of cognition that enlarges your own instead of autistically picking apart axioms and arguments    you seem to like heidegger is there any literature on him or by him thats sort of in the same stream as these threads i really need to read his essay on technology
  love of god is hate of children    unironic and underrated
  tfw youre picking up hints of heisman in fucking timecube    the rabbit hole is too deep bros
  the book question concerning technology is good for the title essay and age of the world picture both of which are relatively easy to understand without having to get deep into heidegger i would put him in the category of cosmotechnic thinkers only with the caveat that he describes the system mostly to criticize it there are implications throughout his writing that man can adapt his use of technology to have a closer relationship with being but for the most part his discussion of technology centers on describing its ontological properties to show that it is a mode of thinking that must be escaped if youre already deeply read in more contemporary cosmotech thought eg deleuze land simondon yuk hui im going to guess you wont find the intellectual content of his more cosmotechnical discussions that original though stylistically it is enthralling and worth reading just for that from the historical perspective as well its really cool to see him laying much of the groundwork for most of the current cosmotech thinkers    much of what is posted here about how truth manifests itself in space and time has strong parallels to heidegger so if thats your interest as well then i think all of his writings cover some aspect of that    for additional recs that might be up your alley  being and times discussion of tools  heideggers confrontation with modernity gets posted a lot here but i havent read it
yfw even the schizos are profoundly boring  why do you waste your time writing this
  why is it boring
  and this
  aw shit dont tell me this nigga is arborescent
  all right i will yeah im familiar with this milieu so shouldnt be too hard going    much of what is posted here about how truth manifests itself in space and time has strong parallels to heidegger so if thats your interest as well then i think all of his writings cover some aspect of that    im unfamiliar with heideggers late thought besides ereignis and lichtung what do you mean by this
  these are great whose making these
  using philosophical concepts to describe black holes in correlation with spatiotemporal existence describing temporality and spatial occurrence in black holes despite black holes being only an anomaly that can also be destroyed via heat death just as the universe could be
  he took it literally    baka senpai
  how in the fuck are black holes to be considered metaphorically are you just attempting to say abyss instead
  in black holes    no within the event horizon not the singularity proper big difference
  its all in the op     and the materials here 
  but space and time still necessarily function in a unity in that moment there still remains an existence of the object therefore meaning that the form of spacetime correlates with the events of the event horizon despite an outside observer being ultimately unable to apprehend the phenomena making the condition of the black hole still relevant to the terms of the universe hence meaning that both the event horizon and singularity are subject to the similar existence of spacetime and that there is no necessity towards the conversation of space and time working in a disjointed process temporalization of space and spatialization of time as the functionality of black holes are entirely based around its difference towards the universe and not of time and space itself fragmenting in absolute terms even something like accretion disks still has the maintained property of matter representing the speeds and not of the temporal entirely working upon a potential wholeness of space the black hole is not simply a phenomenological thing it is discernable only to the extents that apply of the universe as a whole and not towards an intentionality formed of its existence the reason why i mention this is precisely due to your interpretation of this physical thing as something to be regarded epistemologically as if this state is comparable in any fashion to the knowledge of humans in the sense of apprehending time or space its a futile task that can only be regarded by those who would read bergson over einstein
  heidegger categorized his later work as a philosophy of ereignis so if you understand this concept then you might be able to imagine how it forms the basis of truth being distributed on historical grounds basically the fact that being can cohere itself into things meant in a specifically heideggerian way that can connect up with other things and form systems/cultures means that the manifestation of any given thing is determined in an everyday sense by how a culture appropriates an ereignis into a coherence that functions in a communicable sense for instance his dictum language is the house of being illustrates this just as different styles of houses give us different ways to live different languages give different places for how being shows itself to us although being eclipses every culture mans only path to being is through culture so much of philosophy is about how locating various the various openings to ontology within our culture that it receives from being a good example of this though written before he became more explicit about the term ereignis is the greek temple in the origin of the work of art the temple receives its fullest manifestation of being as being a place where properties of the physical earth are given a historical rootedness in the sacred practices of man that usher in a truth specific to the place this is the sense of history that heidegger brings up in contradistinction to our usual sense of hisotriology as in the scientific study of the events of the past to determine what really happened best source on this is basic questions of philosophy     the book that encapsulates this is the beiträge zur philosophie vom ereignis but this is his most difficult work and you cant tackle without being familiar with heidegger for a while the best avenue into it is reading a bunch of his post turn works which you could roughly say are all investigations into specific manifestations of being in various historical forms so his analyses of poetry are always tied closely to earthrelated imagery investigations into language focus on the gathering power of words within communities meditations on architecture are asking about how a building creates a distinct sense of place in its presence the two collections poetry language thought and on the way to language are recommended for this aspect of his thinking
  i do there will be more later when wojak posts next thread whenever that is
  well im not gonna sit here and tell you im a physicist but its pretty obvious these are phenomenological/mystical interpretations of cosmological phenomena what a black hole is corresponds pretty closely to what schellings negative principle in god which lines up pretty well with the platonic conflation of unity/oneness with identity which itself sheds some interesting light on western temporality and the presuppositions that drive it etc etc      okay anon thank you heidegger really is the mac daddy of this isnt he
  in terms of explicit influence heidegger is most responsible for several of the most pertinent lines of thinking in cosmotechnics today however you see a lot of the strains of his thinking arise in a few different philosophers in the late 19thearly 20th century the one that springs to mind most readily is bergson whose critique of science as being confined to the pure exteriority of space could serve just as well as the foundation for much of continental thought today german thought in the 30s and 40s was very attuned to the metaphysical implications of man merging with machine as you might expect from a society so affected by industrial warfare so there was plenty of precedence in the issue when heidegger threw his hat in the ring with question concerning technology for instance ernsts brother friedrich junger had been writing about how man metaphysically alters himself in serving machines you can detect these concerns in walter benjamin as well heidegger became the most influential philosopher on the issue but it was on the mind of many intellectuals in the decades before and after the world wars today this influence is most explicit largely from poststructural thinkers most notably foucault and derrida crediting him for opening up the philosophical mission they were now continuing and/or critiquing    if youre interested rudiger safranski has a great chapter on the german intellectual atmosphere toward technology in his book heidegger between good and evil
is it possible to reconcile ones relationship with the female race after reading weininger  i made the mistake of finishing sex and character and now i become physically ill when im in the presence of a female
  weininger is a grade a incel the best thing he did was killing himself only in a pseudoliberal monarchy artobsessed shithole could such an antisocial and amoral class of thinkers evolve and find an audience think real fucking hard whether what you just read was in any way scientific and not some fucking rambling of a critical modernist selfhating jew in the repulsive city that was late 19th century vienna
  weininger is a grade a incel    not an argument
  obviously it was only an introduction the title of the book that was my whole post if you will read it fully
  kys      why women are wonderful if you dont let them anywhere near your heart or wallet you just have to become a stoic sex god who fucks and dumps and acts amiable in any social situations with women that dont involve blowjobs keep your emotional distance and all will be well
  kys  are you offended because im right
  thats some bad writing anon
  the pleb womanizer vs the patrician romantic  youre supposed to fall in love with 3 women at once cheat on them all with bar sluts and then be heartbroken when they leave you
  good thing im writing on a fucking vietnamese basketsewing forum dumbass
  other than doing lines of crushed dianabol and coke nope
  this is also a good strat
  cringe    if hes good enough for witty then hes good enough for everyone
  retarded faggot
  t afraid of emotional pain
  once you overcome the sexual drive your relationship to women is basically the same as it would be with any childish and/or effeminate man you are free to be offended by them but you are still obligated to treat them with legality so long as you are under civil law as well as humanity so long as you are under moral law
  cringe
  the hard thing about being volcel is that women instinctively realise they have no power over you and increase their seduction games a lot
  that is why you do not invite them to your dinner parties
  theres actually some degree of truth to you are saying weird to see the replies anons are giving you
i hope i live long enough to see roasties holocausted after the artificial womb is invented
  cringe
  witty read him ironically
    i feel a lot of this selfdescribed physical sickness around women is just an inverted hatred at an inability to fulfill a primal and human urge    more than men women can often be petty but to say half the planet are innately disgusting is no less hysterical a romantic relationship even love is one of the most revelatory experiences you can have     it is not the only one of course but the posts of all these incels sounds to me like the cunnolingual version of a sour fox
  a romantic relationship can be a revelatory experience  if complaining about the pettiness of incels on 4chan then justice is on your side but weininger would not have denied your claim he has a whole chapter dedicated to eroticism and its significance for man
  youre
  t obsessed jew
  you are a really poor writer

  there are three subspecies of humans that live on this planet  men  women parasites  submen parasitized worker drones    this post was either made by a woman parasite or a subman parasitized worker drone it is impossible to tell because the subman takes on the ideology of his master women becoming a translucent husk whose only function is to reflect that ideology     women produce and emanate the ideology reflexively because it is their native condition its all they can see in the world if a man is not obeying a woman her brain will produce an error message and she will default to saying well i bet hes only doing that because he isnt one of my chosen pussy squadron who is worthy of my sacred pussy that explains it there can be no such thing as a man who does not want my great and powerful pussy so he must secretly crave my pussy and hes angry that he cant get it therefore as with all other beings in reality whose anchor is my puss he is still my slave in fact he is an even lower and more degraded form of slave living out in the harsh chaotic wilderness away from the pure awesome light of my divine cosmicizing pussy in pussy privation from the axis mundi if you try to say to a woman no really excuse me i have a wife and children already and i am not interested in your pussy or if you say maam please stop telling me about how i must secretly crave your flaps i am francis of assisi and i have a lot of work to do today in fact just now im travelling to tours the woman will default back to the error message and begin calling st francis a beta male who cant get no holy divine pussy the manifestly sole purpose for the universe existing the ens realissimum around which all else orbits     the subman has no thoughts per se but repeats slogans and shibboleths that he has timidly introjected and now repeats mechanically whenever he sees the sacred pussy being mocked by wild barbarian men who still live in freedom he too insists that the paradoxical free man must somehow be an illusion must really be an even lower form of slave than he is himself the existence of the free man is too painful the only explanation for someone rejecting the awesome power of the pussy the only purpose of life is that he must secretly crave it so badly that it has destroyed his mind and left him bitter and broken the subman has no concepts and he is incapable of discursive thought the pussy is his mysterium tremens and he desperately scrabbles at rites and formulas sufficient for venerating it he travels the countryside chastizing men for not kowtowing to women with a dry rasping tongue he is forever a slave to holes
  good post funny seeing the negative replies like kys cringe yikes makes me think

the great man of science unless he is also a philosopher  deserves the title of genius as little as the man of action
i hate women i have an image of women inside of my brain that makes me feel sympathy and pity for them that makes me want to treat them well and protect them that makes me attracted to them but this is just an ideal a falsity that has no bearing on the reality of what women actually are and what they actually are are hideous vile monsters but my brain wants me to like them its this turmoil and cognitive dissonance that makes me hate them but even if that were to resolve id still hate them because of what they are
  kek the effeminate passive aggressive attempt at being dismissively witty only proves him right pussyboy
  hateful little faggot
  i wish i was a faggot since i wouldnt have to be attracted to women
  youre not attracted to women youre attracted to flesh arranged in a certain form
  trannies arent women buddy
  do you feel powerful saying this
  humans are animals human females are meant to manipulate males indeed they can do so just with a certain look or some tears unfortunate but it is what it is cant escape your form biology no need to hate just emotionally disassociate yourself from them so as to retain as much sovereignty as possible

i think women arent too different from men
  cant attack the argument  better attack the person behind it  is this how the brainlet mind operates
expecting 4chan to have a productive conversation about anything involving women  the only reason to post threads like this is to bait what is always the saddest parade of limpdick pseudointellectualizing sadsacks trying to convince themselves that they arent so petty as to hate women merely because they cant fuck that there has to be some material higher reason for their frustration faggots not even man enough to be elliot jr and he had an actual real juicy ass pussy for a mouth    this is why there are no girls on the internet the mere mention of them is like showing your teeth to a room of brain damaged chimps

weininger is god he solved it all even the jewish question thats why he will remain forgotten or reviled at best
  there is no argument
  they are as subversive as the eternal female while being much more intelligent
  see now ure doing it too
    embarrassing you sound like a pua fag circa 2013 sort yourself out
  does anyone tell me why weininger kills himself i heard he killed himself because he was gay it sten andersson mention him like a homosexual in his book filosofen som inte ville tala
  yes because weinigers claims are unsubstantiated    the guy had very little understanding of how women worked
why do incels get so angry when they are called incels the insult is not at all dissimilar to the hole insult which they espouse so much the incel is defined by his celibacy as the woman is defined by her hole
    shut up femoids     what you think of how you work is unrelated to the reality of interaction with you
  probably because he was jewish      explain
  your analysis of my psyche seems pretty wack how could one know more about me from a few posts ive made on a message board than ive known about myself from years of experience being me it also strikes me that you call me a femoid while there has been no indicator that i am a femoid
  explain  he doesnt provide scientific evidence and his writings are mostly based on individual observations    his writings have as much worth as the average copypasta on women here
  appeal to authority    he does make some clever observations but his reasoning is very farfetched he makes assumptions without significant evidence and from these assumptions stem all of his theories of woman     to go from women are liars to women are illogical and non ethical is a pretty big jump yes it makes sense in his logical framework but that framework is completely unsubstantiated
  this is what marxist shitheads think
  i have never interacted with women in my entire life  i have never read the bible  i call out appeal to authority and ad hominem in my conversations like a high school student  im a marxist shithead who thinks men and women are equal  i dont think man and woman are inherently in opposition and they both want the same things    what fucking world do u live in you are a shitty reader hmmm it says here that a dog is a mans best friend but is there any scientific substantiation for that claim
  does that make them wrong though
  anyone who has these views instantly outs themselves as a retard that is being overly particular about his worthless feelings if you havent noticed  barley anyone on this wasteland should even be considered human  that goes for men women blacks whites jews all of them huffing the fumes of their identitarianism and when you see them squabbling no me human they betray their weakness they are thralls to language     you can have your word human  i hope the title feels earned
  great men dont care about chasing tail  stephen hawking was a complete pervert who used to go to sex clubs and strip clubs on the regular  would sit in his chair and get naked while naked women grinded on him  wouldve been out chasing tail so hard if he could actually move    
  all the idiots in this thread who used to post exclusively on /r9k/ but who now draw on guys like evola and weininger to justify being bitter faggots who spend all their time crafting browsing and cataloging theories of their sexual impotence under the pretence that they are explaining why women are inferior to men  i hate all of you so god damn much
  well this is ad hominem you do nothing to critique my post nice rebuttal     apart from that dog analogy you could have a point here except that weininger starts with the idiom that all women are liars is that true though dont blame me if i dont believe hes just making general statements based on individual anecdotes
  preach sister i bet hes a virgin

when did you grow out of your science fiction bad phase
when i read nick land quentin meillassoux reza negarestani and ray brassier
  i mean theres probably good stuff out there but most of it is shit like manga except i like that
never cared enough to dislike it it just doesnt interest me
  based
it isnt like it isnt enjoyable there just isnt any work that contains as much literary merit as most literature
  i never had that phase it just so happened that all sci fi literature ive ever read was shit
is dune actually good guys book of the new sun
all i got out of your image is a reminder of how much i would rather be teaching emily dickinson than science fiction right now
  someone please explain the line between genre and literary fiction
  this   or rather i was into it in my teens but it no longer interests me   recently reread fifth head of cerberus and enjoyed it though so i may do the same with book of the new sun
  that image is like a 13 year olds idea of what proper literature is its more  proper literature is probably more the jet pack in nature
i didnt because i know that science fiction is predictive programming for the coming technocracy
  yes at least the 1st one no
  dune you can skip if youre not typically into scifi  wolfe you should read but you can try fifth head of cerberus first for a taste to see if he may be up your alley
  its the line between fancy and imagination
  genre  things old university jews told me are childish  literary  things old university jews all agree are deep and important
when i read some strugatsky brothers
  based
never did but most science fiction is trash admittedly this is true for most genres and scifi is generally better quality entertainment than fantasy
  when i read pkd
  i forgot when i mean genres i mean all fiction there are plenty of bad serious fiction books
  i never had one but i started with fahrenheit 451 so that may explain it
  after reading a rose for ecclesiastes and a canticle for leibowitz
when i entered the science fiction worse one
  ive unironically never been interested in genre fiction good literary fiction is much more interesting than genre fiction
  science fiction is better in visual formats  prove me wrong
  this i read hitchhikers guide and lotr and thats it for genre fiction unless you count stuff like 1984 and brave new world as sci fi which i dont i do want to try book of the new sun though
  i also want to try ubik
  you should definitely check out wolfe and also check out mervyn peake pretolkien fantasy  i also liked le guin a lot as a teen but im not sure how shed hold up now
  the only scifi i read are warhammer 40k novels
  for better or worse science fiction and fantasy are really childish though and contemporary writers seem to have an obsession about making it more adult not that theres anything wrong with it but if you enjoy it youre probably a manchild
  id say theres nothing wrong with the occasional bit of genre fic and there is some really good stuff but if thats all you read then yeah youre a manchild same way that there is good anime/manga nge berserk etc and if you like anime as well as other stuff then thats fine but if you never read/watch anything more complex than anime youre a manchild
  id argue that anyone who enjoys that kind of media in general anime video games etc is a manchild to some degree no shame in admitting it
  i agree with that if theres the to some degree im just saying there are degrees of separation
  id argue that anyone who enjoys that kind of media in general anime video games etc is a manchild to some degree  this argument is wrong
  well obviously theres a difference between enjoying it on occasion and being a neet who collects anime pillows
  it depends why youre doing it and how much if you just want light easy to digest entertainment then theres no difference between reading shit genre fiction and watching marvel movies and like watching movies you dont want to do it all the time because it isnt anything more than light entertainment  if you want to get something out of it then most genre fiction is incredibly bad for that if not detrimental
  science fiction literature can be really good if its actually literary and not just descriptive stories of cool shit happening william gibsons the winter market is one of my favorite works in general when i first read the opening and got to this line i knew i was in for some good stuff  because she was dead and id let her go because now she was immortal and id helped her get that way and because i knew shed phone me in the morning
  for better or worse science fiction and fantasy are really childish though  ok schlomo
sci fi    eg dune foundation series the culture etc    its much better than fiction etc it takes speculation of alt worlds and repercussions alot more effort and skill
  a must
ive never not enjoyed science fiction im currently reading a collection of kurt vonnegut and the sirens of titan is one of my favorite novels
why does science fiction get a bad rep on this board is it just pseuds who only read philosophy like what else do people even read at that point then
ive always loved hard sci fi it fills a very different spot than proper literature but it has its place
  i started reading scifi as a kid and as i grew older i kept reading better and better scifi same as with other books  so i never really had that moment but i definitely read plenty of garbage both genre and otherwise
when people say scifi is garbage what they really mean is so much scifi is garbage that you might as well say all of it is garbage
  based tanith first and only poster
  when i discovered that scifi has hot alien milfs
science fiction is top tier art how can you see it as anything less than cutting edge philosophy nerds should eat it up for its implications but really sci fi is the true pleb filter as most people are concerned with having big brains or at least being perceived that way     god you pretentious faggots should all get aids
scifi is inhuman autism literature its not about characters as humans rather characters are robotic tools for whatever autistic concept the author wants to explore you can see it in ops image where the focus of the scifi side is a jetpack where the literature side is a group of people conversing with each other
when i read dune and the works of phillip k bepis
thoughts on the space traders    
  characters in literary fiction are just tools as well for whatever political or philosophical ideology the author wants to peddle
i dont mind science fiction so long as there isnt an overemphasis on technology too much science fiction has too much of a boner over rationality and zomg science and technology rather than an exploration of humanity the human condition and morality through futuristic stories
  imagine being so autistic that you take op pic at face value
  t autistic fiction reader that cant empathize with other humans    i didnt say that was what was intended i think it simply shows inadvertently
  hard scifi claims another pleb
  whats the hardest scifi out there
is aniara technically scifi
  not sure about hardest but nivens ringworld books are apogee of autism
  one of my favourites
  hard means most scientifically correct no ftl travel for instance
  i never went through one    although i will always have a burning disdain for anything from the syfy channel and anything star trek related absolute fucking trash
  go for lem the strugatzkijs and maybe ballard
  also the bleakest
  genre is basically a theme which works exceptionally well because it fits the taste of the normie 100iq population so it is repeated again and again and again with a myriad of variations gothic novels were probably the first genre fiction reading genre means you want more of the same stuff like going to mcdonalds you will pretty much know what you are about to get with a few exceptions there will be no surprises sorry if that sounds snobby
it is a genre for people that understand neither science nor fiction but would like to tell themselves that they do
  aniara  no even if it were it would be an exception so it we
  genre is basically a theme which works exceptionally well because it fits the taste of the normie 100iq population  proper hard scifi eg greg egan counts as genre and no normalfags read it
  there is plenty of science in some sci fi the issue is the genre includes both fantasy but in space and scientific ideas but awkwardly turned into a story
  reading genre means you want more of the same stuff  fantasy is usually repetitive tolkien pastiche but scifi is rated almost entirely on innovation do you think anybody cares about the prose or the characters in ringworld its famous purely because of the cool new idea the ringworld asimov churned out enormous quantities of crap but he came up with the three laws of robotics and that was new and interesting scifi is the most noveltyseeking of all genres literary fiction is more repetitive in every way except style
  see here it is  do you think anybody cares about the prose or the characters in ringworld its famous purely because of the cool new idea  this is my point exactly 
  thats a big pizza haha
  forever war is autistic about ftl but it also has psychics and some other odd stuff
  literary fiction uses its own techniques characters tropes imagery narrative structures and so on all to tell the authors own story    genre fiction frequently plunders the techniques characters tropes imagery and narrative structures of literary fiction or more often other genre fiction which itself took it from literary fiction it does not tell the authors own story it tells the genres story    so for example dune goes all into the nature of idols how peoples are shaped by their environments religion the idea of the ubermensch space jews and so on meanwhile princess of mars takes all the tropes and character archetypes of pulp fiction and transplants it to an admittedly rather original world and tells a bog standard pulp fiction story aboutthe american hero saving the day and the princess

  both dune and book of the new sun are kino
  when i read this
  when i started reading lem
  for you lmao
  which ones the best
  the ones featuring pirx or ijon tichy as the protagonist
  this but without the old university jews
  which ones are those aside from tales of pirx the pilot
  i havent read them all yet but ijon tichy is featured in at least the futurological congress the star diaries and memoirs of a space traveler
  theyre pretty different  different enough to make philip k dick think that lem is actually a group of soviet agents trying to infilitrate the american scifi market    pirx and congress were my favourite so far
  fiasco  ijon tichys diaries  observation on the spot  the futurological congress  peace on earth  the last two are goat
        thanks
  liu cixins books are pretty hard i didnt like them personally but thats probably because i dont like hard sf
it is bad though sf writers get too obsessed with being clever and forget to add any human element the characters are usually cardboard pasteins merely to further the plot as an excuse to show off more falsecleverness the beauty of clever science in sf is that it doesnt have to actually work as opposed to being an actual scientist/inventor/engineer irl sf is where pseuds go to masturbate over their sweetheart theories that would be chopped into bits in five minutes by any actual engineer     vonnegut is vulgar trash
  you arent wrong about this but its simply a stylistic choice by them i enjoy the autistic approach they employ because prose isnt everything you jackass i bet you hang on every word hemingway wrote but cant see the beauty in the simplicity of asimov    kys
  asimov is one of the exceptions to cardboard characters because he had both a heart and a brain   hurr you must like hemingway  i really hope you arent implying hemingway is bad hes not the best but hes infinitely more valuable a read than sf writer 526 its another hardboiled detective genre fic but with an evil empire even cuntier women who are always the most beautiful woman ever some self important prick of an mc who always has a clever plan everyone acts depressed all the time because alcoholism is how you show youre enlightened and deep and lets throw some quantum physics allusions and entry level data science concepts on top so lemmings think its clever and that was something you fuckstains on /lit/ specifically recommended   here ill say i like speaker for the dead by orson scott card why he can actually write human characters with more complexity than a flat stereotype he uses the science fiction elements to provide an environment for his characters as opposed to most sf writers who just want to masturbate over how many wikipedia articles theyve read and use the characters as an afterthought to prop up wow spaceships and hurr uhhhh ray gunszzz yuh knowing what centripetal force is and elaborating on it to make a fancy spaceship concept doesnt make you smart it lets the rest of us know thats your idea of what smart is   talking about the humanity of a work  hurr prose isnt everything  if you cant tell the difference between character development and prose please fuck off to your general and never again leave
  because prose isnt everything  complaining about the lack of a human element means you only care about prose  this is autism you cant even conceive of the humanity that science fiction lacks because you dont relate to it at all keep your literature in the containment thread where it belongs or better yet in the trash can
  wow you got your asshairs in a twist its obvious that im saying hemingway is great but your tiny brain makes the distinction between him and most science fiction because hes high art and you view science fiction as beneath you again your crazed ramblings just make no sense and you cant acknowledge its just a stylistic choice hemingway writes a lot like asimov as in how dry they can both be its funny because the archetypes youre talking about come from the golden age era of scifi and the strong knowitall male characters have fallen out of fashion since the 80s you massive cocksmoker asimov was golden age and one of the big three i feel bad that you cant explore the ideas of arthur c clarke because muh character development duurrr yah buddy you can only limit the scope of philosophical ideas to the human experience fuckin pleb
  his feelings are hurt
  tldr go back to your containment thread
  hhes in our scifi canon so you cant say anything bad about him  no one cares about your golden age notice how comic books use this same terminology it must be endemic to nonliterary endeavors
  he starts memeing because he has no education in the genre     wow im glad all that spiritual development you got out of reading serious literature prepared you so well whats sad is that its obvious you think youre superior without any working knowledge of the genre youre just a troll parking as an intellectual contract aids at once
read japanese science fiction  characters are actual humans that develop and the science fiction ideas are almost secondary  read western science fiction  autism look at my cool science idea this is static character x9830 who will be serving as our protagonist also look at this cool idea did you see this idea
  being this gay
  no u
  has no education in the genre  stop using serious terms for things that no one takes seriously it looks silly
  literary is a genre
  does it hurt holding in all the turds in your tight ass i cant imagine taking myself so seriously in a world where literature definition wont eveb get you laid anymore
tfw the best work of science fiction is an anime
  wwell you dont have sex  so this is what science fiction readers resort to in the end
  yah i mean im sure pkd sells more books than tolstoy but like haha nobody cares right
  japanese science fiction  drop some recs nigger what are you doing    reading serious literature  waaaaahhhhhh mommy that anon said my robot series books arent serious literature mommy mmooooonnnnnnmmmmmmmsfadsdaf
  0/10
  have fun reading crime and punishment for the third time so you can excite the guys wearing bow ties in your humanities department
  when did you grow out of your science fiction bad phase    if anything i grew into a science fiction is bad attitude not because thematically there is anything wrong with them  the themes and social commentary or questions they raise can be incredibly relevant and profound rather it is the delivery the package that i find most disappointing the prose the plot the general flow to the story rarely do you get a writer who can understand these and tie it in to an interesting science fiction topic
  theres also a second book featuring pirx not mentioned or seen in the picture more tales of pirx the pilot if anyone knows about any other books with pirx id be thrilled to hear about them hes by far the most likeable character ive stumbled upon thus far
    samefag is samefag imagine being this triggered by people reading robo space operas because youre so worried about the art you consume being taken seriously
  im more worried about whether i myself can take something seriously
  drop some recs nigger what are you doing  i was really just talking about visual novels
    snob     how can one make such ridiculous sweeping judgmental statements     you like x activity which is neither illegal nor can be considered harmful to ones self physical or mental    i will now label you and judge your entire being as a person
  sounds like a personal problem bro
  its a question of integrity
  wow did you learn that from your deep understanding of borges or something    nice to see someone taking a stand on the important issues here
  i learned it from personal reflection
around 17    read asimov and lem and they both fucking sucked
  filename
  this is literally a picture of us right now     guess which one i am
  the lengths people go through to feel important is absolutely astonishing
  its not bad overall but its mainstream appeal and demographic soi males and smart roasties made a highly commercial genre with few works worth anything
  i know man accusing someone of samefagging because you refuse to accept the reality that more than one anon thinks youre a cocksucking idiot what a loser
  sooo youre saying that massively popular genre fiction is bad for appealing to the unwashed masses but youre fine arguing strength in numbers to some anon    top fuckin kek
  imagine needing to justify your shitty book genre this hard
  everybody hurrttssss everybody criiessss    sooomeestimmess
scifi reader acting like an autismo  what a surprise
  never had one
  thats not something you grow out of thats something you grow into
  yes but take this tip in dune eventually the protagonist will start foreseeing a bad thing i wont tell you what it is only that after you see it being brought up once or twice you can skip every paragraph about it from then on its filler that frank thought we wouldnt notice
prone to deus ex machinas because of science  tendency to inconsistency because of technology  probability for lack of realism because of fiction  im not saying scifi is bad per se but 90 is trash and 10 is noteworthy other problems consider lenghty explanations outdatedness nerdyness perverse alien sex scenes marysues
i always liked science fiction and probably always will because its fun
  this is the only distinction that matters here everything else is just childish elitism from people who cant see the difference between a spiderman 2 and an age of ultron
  i pretty much started reading with scifi its been only like 1 year and half since i dropped this genre i kinda regret reading so many scifi book but even though on my shelf there many useless books also there is a good number of pearls wrote by really good writers for example lem and dick or maybe even clarke gibson simmons henleinen and others as a genre has its flaws but often presents an incredible immagination and unironically makes you think
  is this how books work now you need a snappy oneliner at the start or people just drop them
  isnt this kind of a category that most things can fall into given enough time
  same way that there is good anime/manga  you fucked up there there is no good anime or manga its all shit for edgy teenagers      nge berserk  cringe
  which one
  if you dont read sci fi youre a massive cunt that needs to be decunted
  logh
    cringe

  literary writers get too obsessed with being clever and forget to add any human element the characters are usually cardboard pasteins merely to further the plot as an excuse to show off more purple prose     the beauty of clever science in sf is that it doesnt have to actually work as opposed to being an actual scientist/inventor/engineer irl sf is where pseuds go to masturbate over their sweetheart theories that would be chopped into bits in five minutes by any actual engineer    read different science fiction there are lots of writers who put autistic amounts of research into being plausible
as long as the technology/science is a stand in or metaphor for a wider topic science fiction can be damn good if it is just technology that serve no greater purpose it really is missing an opportunity
  thats how some scifi works a line in the first page or two that opens out the scifi elements of the world
  there is no good anime or manga  he said on an anime website
  there are also no good anime websites
  ive always liked it
  is gravitys rainbow sci fi
  dune actually good  no
oh boi  my favourite ya novel of all time is getting a movie treatment         and its fucking terrible    oh wow the russian guy whos hair turns white as a plot point in a later novel is now a white haired black guy    oh yay the first female recon officer is now uh not that  now the commander is a woman and the techie is a woman yay now every single goodguy is a woman    the whole gnomish text that was made for the universe has been replaced for no reason woah great job    magic bows and instead of fighting fantasy creatures with conventional hand guns    laser rifles those characters couldnt use as a plot point are now totally normal    gotta destroy the characters the fans love to make the characters appeal to the international audience    i mean why make a movie actually follow the plot characters or themes of the book when you could just take the title and make some generic bullshit for the widest audience possible ruining every single aspect the book was a cult classic for in the first place
i once saw a movie called miss peregrines house of unusual children or something it wasnt very good but the main character looks like an ugly version of asa butterfield

  but the goat is tom jones still the greatest english novel middlemarch fags can fuck off does middlemarch have a drunken catfight described in mockhomeric language does middlemarch feature a scene where a man accidently goes to bed with his own mother does middlemarch feature the author breaking the fourth wall to explain why youre a pleb for liking all the plot twists hes feeding you    this sounds fucking good desu senpai
  its even better than ive made it sound  as a vast herd of cows in a rich farmers yard if while they are milked they hear their calves at a distance lamenting the robbery which is then committing roar and bellow so roared forth the somersetshire mob an hallaloo made up of almost as many squalls screams and other different sounds as there were persons or indeed passions among them some were inspired by rage others alarmed by fear and others had nothing in their heads but the love of fun but chiefly envy the sister of satan and his constant companion rushed among the crowd and blew up the fury of the women who no sooner came up to molly than they pelted her with dirt and rubbish  molly having endeavoured in vain to make a handsome retreat faced about and laying hold of ragged bess who advanced in the front of the enemy she at one blow felled her to the ground
  youre an idiot if you read rousseaus confessions and thought of him as anything other than a kept woman he might have tried for a few years to make something of himself but ultimately he was findomed into genius by a more intelligent woman you want to do tic for tac my year is open bitch come at me
  uhhh what are you talking about

itt foreign depictions of western culture accurate or otherwise
jokes aside this manga is pretty legit guy did a lot of research even taking the time to explain the roman triple battle line pretty entertaining depiction of the 2nd punic war
  thats pretty amazing even the art is western
  me on the bottom left
  hahahahahahaha so true so so true
  where can you buy ad astra in english
      lol
    top kek
would you say this is accurate
  dunno reading it online   
  its a little meanspirited
  thanks anon
  good fucking morning  fucking breakfast motherfucker    is this what a morning person looks like
      accurate
it even depicts the senate house accurately not even western media does that wtf how does one nerdy japanese guy depict the romans better than most western novels/shows/movies
  how does one nerdy japanese guy    if its just one guy doing it then hes not going to be limited by a committee of television producers telling the director/writer to cut down on the politics and have more sex
  i guess its helpful that his japanese audience wont have many preconceived notions of what the roman world is supposed to look and feel like so he can go 100 authentic rather than pander to tropes take the senate house for example in most western media they depict it as a semicircle and so most people believe that it was always that way if a movie were to depict it like it truly was then the audience would be confused and think that the film got it wrong

post redpilled reviews    pic related is of the trial
  he finished the ending it doesnt cut off mid sentence wtf did she read
  mrs  uhuh
  the castle apparently
im about to buy this please tell me i am not getting memed right now
female author    yeah im sorry youre getting memed
you arent theyre fun and informative and easy to read   graves version is badly written and dont listen to nerds who say read apollolondorus or whatever the fuck his ancient ass name was its a really dry telling of the stories like graves and ovid is only good once you know the myths
  its a good way to get into the myths and have a basic understanding of them when you sit down and read them in full individually
im also about to buy this later hopefully its good
  she is only one of the authors some of them died thousands of years ago
get hesiods theogony and ovids metamorphoses instead  the former is the greek creation myth told by a person who actually believed it and the latter is a beautiful compilation of myths bound together by the theme of change written by one of romes best poets  go get homers iliad and odyssey too while youre at it
  ugh no he should get on those after reading hamilton shes literally the best introduction there is stop memeing
ive always loved greek mythology and i bought this book cause everyone shilled it but holy shit is it boring
  ovids metamorphoses was my introduction to greek and roman mythology back when i was 11 years old  ive read hamilton and bullfinchs books and i thought their prose was kind of dry unelegant not fitting for something as refined as classical myths  reading hamilton to learn about greek mythology would be like reading some childrens book on world religions written by an atheist to learn about biblical stories instead of actually reading the bible
  well if you did that at 11 youre on a higher level than most of us here mate
  cares about the gender of an author when the work has nothing to do with it  
  yep i felt the exact same way
  this a kids book she writes like a woman its embarrassing at times
  it is a good place to start but you must procees to read the originals in their entirety
  if you received american education go for it  if european you should know it all already
is it part of the western canon
  it should bespoiler
  why
  its a minor work by a minor writer like catcher in the rye
  it has been referenced and alluded to since and is part of our cultural lexicon even today
  what is part of our lexicon
it seemed kinda gay to me
  nick carraway seemed gay to me too anon
    didnt he smash the tennis player
  what is your point    gay people never smash anyone
  they usually dont smash women yeah
  how about /ourguy/ he was married
  yes  is that justified only time will tell my pet theory is that its emblematic of americas inability to write great big books ie were condemned to shorter forms with the schtick of compression 
  do you think they boned
  what is moby dick  what is the recognitions  what is mason  dixon
  what is exceptions to the rule mostly seperated by many years  also if a you think mobydick is a long book and b you think mason  dixon can stand on the same stage as anna karenina youre delusional
  mason  dixon is better than anna karenina
i want to do some reading about the russian revolution and the eventual bolshevik take over of russia in order to do some of my own writing on the topic im hesitant to just jump in and start taking suggestions because i am worried about communist bias toward the bolsheviks in the history what are some fair books about the revolution that i ought to check out bonus points if they pertain to alexander karensky i am curious to read more of his role in resistance to the reds

paul stood in the middle of the areopagus and said you men of athens i perceive that you are very religious in all things  for as i passed along and observed the objects of your worship i found also an altar with this inscription to an unknown god what therefore you worship in ignorance this i announce to you    the god who made the world and all things in it he being lord of heaven and earth doesnt dwell in temples made with hands   neither is he served by mens hands as though he needed anything seeing he himself gives to all life and breath and all things   he made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the surface of the earth having determined appointed seasons and the boundaries of their dwellings  that they should seek the lord if perhaps they might reach out for him and find him though he is not far from each one of us   for in him we live and move and have our being as some of your own poets have said for we are also his offspring  being then the offspring of god we ought not to think that the divine nature is like gold or silver or stone engraved by art and design of man   the times of ignorance therefore god overlooked but now he commands that all people everywhere should repent   because he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he has ordained of which he has given assurance to all men in that he has raised him from the dead    now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead some mocked but others said we want to hear you again concerning this    thus paul went out from among them  but certain men joined with him and believed among whom also was dionysius the areopagite and a woman named damaris and others with them

who is the brian eno of literature
  dfw unironically
  how so
  a certain nonchalant virtuosity and besides they were contemporaries at their peak so they share aesthetic and zeitgeist read some infinite jest with ambient 1 in the background
  well those two works werent contemporary so ignore what i said to be honest they just seem to fit together ambient works by eno and ij would work wonderfully in the setting of a mid class business hotel lobby or regional airport
  infinite jest is too noisy to match with ambient try it with portraits of ugly men or dont read dfw hes kind of shit
  dfw  nonchalant virtuosity  literally scanning thesaurus 10 hours a day  nonchalant
  that guy who doesnt do the thing nobody thought not doing
  ambient is supposed to be background with foreground noise on top of it dfw is kind of shit i shouldnt have said unironically i was being ironic
  perhaps i hvnt pondered it much more a fan of airports to be honest ambient is an experimental brick phone airports a blackberry also  tripposting

red pill me on speed reading /lit/    i feel like i have more books on my reading list than i have time to read
  is a scam is literally skimming pages    even if you read 50 pages daily which is normal and average you can finish one book in a week    i just started to read more and stopped watching games and cartoons and ive read 12 books this month    a book a day  i can read a single book of 120 pages in 3 hours
  is literally skimming pages    its learning to skim pages well its useful for inane reading news articles solely for the information or if youve gotta read something quickly for school or work and pretend to have thought deeply about the book but if you do this for every book you are a pseud
  are you fucking autistic
    no my mom took me to a specialist when i was young because she thought i was autistic and was instead diagnosed with depression and avoidance personality disorder
    like the above anons said speed reading is glorified skimming which is useful for a preliminary reading and outlining of the piece of literature in question
  how about just enjoying the fucking book
  modest chuckle
is there a superior edition/translation and why doesnt this modern classic have a leatherbound print in existence
  leatherbound  what year is it gramps
there is an earlier translation that is better its on libgen    this translation takes its source text from a heavily revised 60s manuscript while he earlier takes a 20s manuscript this translation cuts out a lot of discussion on tactics used and some strategy talk as well as the young soldiers thoughts on the war replaced by a heavily rewritten account from an author changing the text to suit whatever the political thoughts of the time where while the earlier translation has some straight up poor translation choices revolver is translated as just pistol for example you will be getting a better text more closely resembling the war diaries and without the translator removing aspects he doesnt think youll like
  i suspected this would be the case thanks       kill yourself kindle cuck
  surprised you have some concept of what a kindle is although i dont use one   do you put your papyrus scrolls next to the books bound in animal skin or do they have their own shelf
  do you put your papyrus scrolls next to the books bound in animal skin  unironically thinking this is insulting    wew lad im sure youll be right at home watching katy perry on the vr while you eat your mealworm burgers in the not so distant future
    it does have a leatherbound editioni have seen it its the hoffman translation too
  thinking katy perry is zoomer  katty perry was a fucking decade ago oh ye ancient one  and jacking into cyberspace is still infinitely superior to playing physical bingo after the nurse changes your bed pan
  is that howard fertig 1996 the only english versions listed are that and the penguin 2003 edition which i already have in paperback
  yes its out of print now unfortunately
  in case if youre wondering if the current translation is bad its not its still a great book finding other translations though is probably going to be a tough task considering theyre out of print and it might be like rolling dice because nobody really has an idea of what are the best translations
from what i understand basil creightons translation was terrible
  you have to buy and read the 1928 edition as he himself cucked his older truer version because he was afraid his nationalism would be seen as nazi    every modern edition uses his multiple times edited cuckery
read eumeswil his editing wasnt strictly cuckery he was only ever navigating the field to remain as independent and potent as possible
this is a severe misreading of jünger and his work    the original version was raw and in some ways less nationalist a later edition from the 20s was the most bellicose this is only natural as this was the period of reaction against the weimar government and the interwar order in general it is true later editions removed some of the more excessive passages but the again werent these passages a product of previous revising
  le born in le wrong generation

rarely if at all see him mentioned here  whats /lit/s opinion of max frisch  do nongerman speakers care about his works    i thoroughly enjoyed his three big novels stiller homo faber gantenbein but only upon exploring his late works namely montauk and man in the holocene i fully recognized the novelty of his prose his take on narration in the form of crystal clear and sparse if not minimalistic descriptions devoid of any additional symbols or judging strikes me as one of the most harmonious and authentic ways of conveying plot character and emotion ive yet come across     but all those technical things aside which i just pulled out of my nose for justification he simply touches me very deeply and i felt the need to start a frisch thread
  was not so fond of andorra which i had to read in school but its been a while and i might come to another conclusion upon rereadling
  i read the play biedermann und die brandstifter for german class and then homo faber to practice my german      i wasnt a huge fan of either but i liked biedermann more it wasnt totally uniqueplenty of books and plays have been written about the rise of totalitarianism although max frisch personally treats fascism and communism as two sides of the same coin i personally found it very similar in principle to a lot of brechts workim thinking of der aufhaltsame aufstieg des arturo ui in particular    i just failed to see the value of home faber outside of languagelearning its overdramatic and driven by uninteresting characters and unrealistic plot elements i get that the unrealistic plot elements are sort of the point but i found that in turn it had very little to say about the actual human condition

  wow i didnt realize that accelerationism is really just about converting socialists to capitalists in the hopes of bringing down capitalism i unironically support this since its gibberish and it will get more people out of the way of capitalism making the world a better place
  intellectuals dont speak in in anyone whos the anyone whos are irrelevant get to your point and stop debasing random fallacies dumb people have to try and make yourself seem more credible this guy is a conceited poser which is sad because im sure id agree with a lot of his points

what if the real accelerationism is the stuff we read along the way to make sense out of that gibberish
shits bad and getting worse and worse is getting worse progressively but maybe if worse gets worse fast enough it will start being better because in actuality worse is better and better is worse
its supporting the bad guy in the marxist view but its still just dumb marxist determinism

and if there is no desire to go back except as a cheap hollywood holiday in other peoples misery  if as lyotard argues there are no primitive societies yes the terminator was there from the start distributing microchips to accelerate its advent isnt then the only direction forward through the shit of capital metal bars its polystyrene its books its sausage pâtés its cyberspace matrix  i want to make three claims here   1 everyone is an accelerationist  2 accelerationism has never happened  3 marxism is nothing if it is not accelerationist    what then is lands philosophy about  in a nutshell deleuze and guattaris machinic desire remorselessly stripped of all bergsonian vitalism and made backwardscompatiblewith freuds death drive and schopenhauers will the hegelianmarxist motor of history is then transplanted into this pulsional nihilism the idiotic autonomic will no longer circulating idiotically on the spot but upgraded into a drive and guided by a quasiteleological artificial intelligence attractor that draws terrestrial history over a series of intensive thresholds that have no eschatological point of consummation and that reach empirical termination only contingently if and when its material substrate burns out this is hegelianmarxist historical materialism inverted capital will not be ultimately unmasked as exploited labour power rather humans are the meat puppet of capital their identities and selfunderstandings are simulations that can and will be ultimately be sloughed off

nick land is what you get when someone takes seriously the notion that reading a lot will make you a good writer
this is the big enchilada op  
how is it not just fascism
  how is it just fascism
  fascists actually like humanity in a cruel and twisted way
here is a picture of nick land back when he first moved to shanghai in the early 2000s
some stupid shit my man
    the main significant difference between this and marxism is that the latter is prophecy waiting for the system to fail itself while accelerationism calls those to take a hammer and begin the deconstruction of the capitalist towers however weve seen in the 20th century numerous leaders try to speed up the end of history under the guise of communism which only led to authoritarian states why would i expect this to be any different
  marxism but you side with capital against humans
  while accelerationism calls those to take a hammer and begin the deconstruction of the capitalist towers    thats one interpretation i suppose but i think accelerationism is best understood as something with a life of its ownsomething that doesnt need our help
  it is cybernetics intensifying feedback loops specifically the mcm circuit as formulated by marx if it does not lead to an intensification of mcm it is not accelerationism
  accelerationism was prescriptive for some leftist retards but its not anymore its just a descriptive doomsday scenario with some scary psychos like nick land thinking its actually good as in what gets liberated is not humanity but capital dynamics itself so we are just a stepping stone for that machinic desire until it doesnt needs us anymore
  so does land like capitalism or not is he just some techlibertarian who sees singapore as a model or simply a supporter to lead capitalism to destruction for a new system
  so does land like capitalism or not    its complicated
  to say he likes capitalism is kinda missing the point he considers the dynamic processes of capital and its movement towards its own annihilation to be productively the same thing so regardless of whether he supports it or not he acknowledges that the only way to reach an terminal exit velocity is to accelerate the process     also in the time it takes to make this point the opportunity to slow this forward motion has already been and gone were always already too late to do anything about it the only viable option left is to push even further regardless of the outcome
  so does land like capitalism or not    capitalism for land is a cosmic phenomenon that has made itself real by assembling itself from the future having done so it dissolves everything in order to rebuild it in its image the first to fall are those who foolishly think they can control it how could he not ally with capitalism
  fair enough      yes i understand it is a simplification but what little of his i have read mostly through interviews seems to suggest he supports capitalism in principle and wishes for its success and feels that there will be some sort of blade runner like world of technology and unbridled capitalism its just perplexing because then he seems to suggest he supports this only to see it collapse
  only to see it collapse    to be honest i dont think there is a collapse at the end in lands take on acceleration not on the part of capitalism anyways
  is he crazy or is this true it feels like its true
  accurate

  no one understands they are just pretending  crazy man writes down crazy fiction novel ideas pretty much it
  land admitted at times that acc is no more or less than aesthetic
  capitalism is a self correcting self improving loop that resembles an ai humans are its hardware so to speak it arises inextricably from human nature ultimately it will transcended humans and leave them behind once we achieve singularity also we should just accept this and accelerate it
  he looks like wcw wrestler sting

  so its stockstandard anarchism

  i duno wat that has to do with nick land but i wanna that twitter girls armpits for sure
  meh at some point when the mood strikes and i cannot live without shitposting ad nauseam ad infinitum about uncle nick once more    kind of enjoying the pause that refreshes tbqh catching up on my eastern mystics and sages and feeling rather cozy indeedy about the whole shebang    especially now that land seems to be about three inches away from just declaring om mani padme hum about the whole thing if capital is simply secrecy/passkeys/codes/signals/open secrets  masks c it just kind of feels like a good time to read the daodejing and journey to the west and the platform sutra et al and begin preparing for wasteland life after the wild ride there is nothing else out there except postapocalyptica anyways    gotta be chill and friendly as you know radical normie acceptance tis a thing      kek
  reeeeeeee  my ai death cult is not your art project
  very based anon
  no not really its almost the complete opposite anarchy is practically decelerationism
  find any two anarchists who can agree on what stockstandard anarchism is for a start  i think nick would argue that its anarchy but probably not in the way  means  for him disintegration to patchwork does constitute an intensifying anarchy defined against its opposite being world government  capitalism as exit  commodification of citizenship  also cryptoanarchy as he once posted on twitter  webarchiveorg/web/20170604095005/theguardiancom/technology/2017/jun/04/forgetfarrightpopulismcryptoanarchistsarethenewmastersinternetpolitics    leftist anarchy is decelerationary and anprim is terminationary but its hard to make a generalization
  need to destroy the current liberal order in order to take us to the next stage of creation
  lol it is now
  this is the most profound execution of prose in the past 80 years the apotheosis of what literary endeavours can achieve in this day and age any serious writer of the future will be able to cite this specific passage as the point where everything changed  i wish nick would write a proper novel
  ywn have uncle nick as a teacher perched on a chair like a mantis stoned and rambling about kant
  fucking kino
how is accelerationism put into practice by its advocates
  why not just commit suicide
  so this is a tricky questions but i will do my best still getting familiar with acceleration myself acceleration is not so much a prescription as a it is a diagnoses it is the an analysis of capital intelligence evolution concluding that they are on a deeply primordial level contingent a similar process that being an intensifying loop of positive feedback     now there are three main forks of acceleration left right and unconditional all of them are shades of neoliberalism that play with a cybergothic antihuman aesthetic arrived at negatively through marx nietzsche gibson and other influence on the ccru none of them are inseparable from neoliberalism in function only in how they aestheticize that function and to what ends good example is shiney mainstream neoliberals see transexuals as a new wave of vibrant fun potential consumers who get their own ben  jerrys icecream ya acc on the otherhand will aestheticize them as a liquefying acausal demons from the future sent by capital to dissolve the pasts deceleration tendencies and they will be cool with it     leftacc is dead as it failed to significantly delineate itself from the shiny mainstream global ubi serfdom neoliberal crowd     rightacc remains no purely analytic by outsourcing prescription to nrx although the two get mixed up by people    unconditionalacc differs from lacc but is more or less the same as racc when divorced of nrx it states that there is no possible way we can make capital serve us anymore the genie is out of the bottle and that there is no stopping it either there is no need to aide like dumb humans even could it either it is taking care of itself by this point
dude things are bad and getting badder  sothis is the power ofnuphilosophywhoa
  ancap here that doesnt sound too bad to me machines will ultimately be far more adaptable they will inherit it all we are just a means to an end a phase
  people into theory dont put anything into practice accerationism in practice is basically just keep doing the same
lol land noticed grimes new song and is amused by it and seems to admire her
  he likes ellen musk so he knows about her plus nrx grimes has been a meme for acctwitter for nearly two years
  leftacc is dead as it failed to significantly delineate itself from the shiny mainstream global ubi serfdom neoliberal crowd    well yeah and the fact that its whole humanist concerns/intentions are fundamentally missing the point     everyone into it seems to be lowkey or straightup nrx or savagely apolitical    but anyways like everything its just larping its all just a style game
  he liked some tweet saying ikr what a queen in response to some sjw leftist being all ugh did grimes really make a transhumanist song with colonialist orientalist cliches
  the nrx grimes twitter was hilariously accurately predictive    although honestly people with grimes type of aesthetic often very much are in a zone that sjw leftists find really problematic to say the least some of them being quietly antileft
  taking politics seriously    everything is mediated by aesthetic experience art is a much more apt way of engaging with realitys antihuman weirdness than politics ever could be
honestly i would love to watch grimes and elon talk shit on whiny leftist journalists during a coke session with diversions into neoreaction talking points
  what are the odds musk has been introduced to nrx / dark enlightenment type texts reading between the lines i get the impression hes probably aware of it and has probably been slipping it into grimes koolaid
it was funny when for a second a few clueless people were inaccurately thinking accelerationism is a philosophy about going through capitalism in order to end it when in fact in most of its forms including that of its most notorious figurehead its simply embracing the system not concerned with accelerating it for some marxist goal in fact its really not at all about that as an anon above said the brief attempt to even theorize a left accelerationism immediately petered out because thats like giving heroin to kids as an antidrug strategy or fapping to end masturbation
  although honestly people with grimes type of aesthetic often very much are in a zone that sjw leftists find really problematic    do you mean her aesthetic for the recent video or do you also include her older stuff in there as well
  older stuff too a large swath of people of that ilk have been kind of apolitical or leftskeptic this isnt a climate where you can be outintheopen about it and of course there are going to be peers who are super lefist in the most sjw judith butlery way too constantly feigning offense at everything but there are also a lot of cutting edge art people that fucking hate that whole mode when i was in art school there was definitely a certain strain of people who were quietly groaning at the whole social justice poststructuralist influence while at the same time being even more cutting edge and weird and in some cases queer one might imagine an altleft appearing in such a zone but the problem is anyone particularly committed that much to the left wouldnt dare distinguishing themselves from the greater left even if they can see flaws in the vampires castle or whatever whereas otherwise a lot of those in the art and philosophy world who are just totally weary of sjw opt either for more just a general liberalism or alternately seem vaguely apolitical in that death gripsy kind of way or come across as someone youd presume is left like some of those around the postccru type zone but who you realize quietly still follow nick land and then there are several who are in actuality just low key dark enlightenment
  i think the chances are very likely when you remember that moldbug and peter thiel are acquainted with one another the silicone valley tech crowd is a small world and was even smaller a decade ago basically everyone knows about moldbug and the ones who were influenced by ur knew it was better to be silent about it dont reveal your support for feudal techlords until you are ready to assume lordship over your hyperfief
  that was actually the exact source i was imagining moldbug / land etcs influence getting to musk by way of thiel or similar types of friends     honestly i really presume grimes herself has probably gotten a whole other perspective knowing musk and then seeing the kind of dishonest info campaigns media pull on him etc and then they probably do a lot of drugs together and talk about crazy futuristic ideas getting into some exciting zones beyond her previous leftist imaginings and all these interesting new synaptic pathways are forming for her
  its a beautiful thing really this is the best possible outcome for an artist i fantasize constantly about getting my own grimes to swoon its the destiny of every hipster faux intellectual girl they break the egg young but never break it enough they arent nornies and begin to develop a taste in art and obscurist hobbies    the great tragedy of this generation is that women have begun to stop doing this as theyre backed by the lingering childless hippies cranking out twitter nihilism and man hate living vicariously through these young women i ruminate often about our childless cities and how theyll come to resemble japan what will that be likethrough the prism of american culture single disgusting men and women so angry that their estrogen levels sink to historic lows       dont ever forget that they did this to not just us but this generation of women too a complete denial of happiness and biological purpose all to sell us more bullshit
  theres much more potential for these art girls to evolve past youthfuldefaultleftism than youd think all the best girls i know around the art world have immense contempt for leftist culture and its not that theyre even right wing theyre just really smart and can see past the pathetic posturing of twitter and college activists the most satisfying anti political conversations ive ever had were with gorgeous cutting edge artworld girls on how pathetic leftists are its so hot to have some art scene beauty smirk evilly at you and exclaim haha im not some fucking feminist i like being a woman its great and easy to be a woman why would i fucking complain so honest and real
  its so hot to have some art scene beauty smirk evilly at you and exclaim haha im not some fucking feminist i like being a woman its great and easy to be a woman why would i fucking complain so honest and real    like i almost imagine grimes kind of coming to this position now when shes chilling with elon like she loves women loves being a biowoman also kind of queerish / genderqueer / whatever but also getting to that but like chill the fuck out about it place
  this is what your 30s look like
  haha true as long as a person isnt utterly warped
grimes  musk  land  sure smells like zoom spirit here
  welcome to realiti
    i feel like ultimately i have way more in common with these women as they have taste im music and art usually unfortunately its alwaus through the shitty post structuralist prism i feel so unbelievably alienated bros ive been toying with the idea of dating christian women because atleast they act normal in public andcan talk to me but they believe in a sky man and i just dont feel like i have options im not sure if i have the patience or the ability to change these art thots     wat do existential crisis ensues
  unfortunately its alwaus through the shitty post structuralist prism    so you shouldnt let what girls believe get to you so much so long as they fall in line when it counts who cares what they think she has her bullshit and you have yours   i am not trying to be mean but isnt this the same mindset a lot of sjws have i will never go out with person x because they believe y
  i see your point anon but im not sure if youre out here in this dating pool im more than willing to accept a difference of opinion but their opinions are so histrionic and aggressive they refuse to love me as a human being i mean my standards have never been so low ever before ill even date a christian i really just want to be accepted and loved as a person and have my points heard  not necessarily agreed with i havent bathed in that love for many years its true that theyve turned on men    i know there are good women out there and im not some incel but this propaganda has crept and embedded itself so deep into society its disturbing my best female friend who ive known for years was joking about how she hates whites as if thats normal i got fucking pissed im just sick of all this hateful shit
this man is a cryptoaccelerationist
  tfw you will never borrow uncle nicks jungle records for a party
  cringe

  this man is   wrong about almost everything
  he said nothing about it being limited to politics  hes reeing about normies
    but they believe in a sky man  desu it sounds like jesus could help you out a bit  whats your hangup with sky man its not like a /acc art girl believes anything less repulsive to common sense
  whats your hangup with sky man  monkey business
  he looks like hes in the matrix
    this is precisely my point its all bad when you grow up and realize youll never have an emotional relationship to a human female again itll make you pine for simpler youthful times of love    how the actual fuck can i explain the bell curve my interest in truly fucked individuals like jim goad the fact that i recognize twitter nihilism as weak but im too weak to find any alternative myself that theres truly no god that ive made huge mistakes in life    everything about me is too complicated and at times frankly smart for women and it hurts not because i hate women but because i love them and want to be loved by them     its truly a battle to not feel serious resentment which is only another dead end part like all of them
  decentralization is inevitable lets just get to it

  by engaging in any productive activity efficiently youre accepting/participating in acceleration in practice  by the time youve theoretically grasped any notion of whats going on to be able to fight it its already moved on its too late  any deceleration has been based in praxis also  anything less than full blown vargpilled kaczynskism is futile  and even then look what happened to ted  youve no power to effect change the only real major entity with any agency against capitalism would be the largely ineffective human security system far too timid to put a dent in the side of the thing now emerging
  any deceleration has to be based
  thats just what the system wants to think
honestly the scifi predictions underlying extreme accelerationist thought wont come to pass anyways    ai will never actually be intelligent in the sense of an actually selfaware subjectivity with its own will its just dumb but complex algorithms spewing out what we put into it there will be no skynet event so people need not worry about it nor embrace it     but theres also the idea of capitalism as a kind of intelligent selfimproving symbiosis of economics and technology sure everything is kind of like this but without the system achieving actual consciousnesslike awareness and intelligence beyond mere lifeless morphological drive that anything has it will always be somewhat in check or answerable to humans who still have that edge on it sure computers can make bigger calculations but not on their own motivations so even if the capitalist machine gets destructive  and it is  much more as an ecological problem  then at some point humans out of pure necessity can and will make adjustments and there will be no conscious ai to stop it that doesnt mean global warming will be fixed or the environment saved or the matter/problem of capitalism solved but ai in a literal sense wont be a problem
  honestly the scifi predictions underlying extreme accelerationist thought wont come to pass anyways    ai will never actually be intelligent in the sense of an actually selfaware subjectivity with its own will its just dumb but complex algorithms spewing out what we put into it there will be no skynet event so people need not worry about it nor embrace it      this is exactly what someone send from the future to protect skynets birth in the past would say
  ai will never actually be intelligent in the sense of an actually selfaware subjectivity with its own will its just dumb but complex algorithms spewing out what we put into it  gthe scifi scenario is literally this but we remove ourself as a source of input you dont need subjectivity to parse data
  ai will never actually be intelligent in the sense of an actually selfaware subjectivity with its own will    land never argues that this is what ai is he actually somewhere on xenosystems i cant remember exact post says that subjectivity consciousness etc may be holding intelligence back and are just random permutations of evolution that we have romanticized this is because his definition of intelligence is competence at winning games and if dumb algorithms can outcompete humans with all their subjectivity and rich innerlife then those things will be jettisoned too     land says nothing human makes it out of the future alive he doesnt just mean flesh and bone
  thats because if you cant win you fucking die  its hardcore evolutionism
  ai will never actually be intelligent in the sense of an actually selfaware subjectivity with its own will its just dumb but complex algorithms spewing out what we put into it  dude you severely underestimate what ai is currently capable of the advancements in ai over the last couple years alone is extraordinary and in another 15 years the world will not be the same
  there are advancements but its still dumb algorithms just really complex ones its more like senseless slimemold intelligence it can make a lot of connections and patterns but its doing it blindly and senselessly a dumb process just crawling along by the logic it was given whats missing is consciousness which were not remotely close to understanding let along producing or simulating and thats the element which would be the real problem
  you are starting from the unfounded assumption that consciousness is inherent to intelligence
  im aware of that and i know he speaks more of this intelligent in the quality of a system or entity that selforganizes by its productive logic which i agree with and what i was referring to in the second paragraph there and its a logic that a lot of things have to some degree if not as radically productive as capitalism     its more my contention that without consciousness though this will have limitations especially if conscious humans are hypothetically outofthepicuture the intensives / prompts to keep moving/producing would start to break down / reach gridlock / exhaust themselves and there wouldnt be a creative intelligence or motivation to work around this resources and feul of course would be burnt out as well
  go to his twitter and call him a boomer
  the intensives / prompts to keep moving/producing would start to break down / reach gridlock / exhaust themselves  t anon who has never programmed before
  ai is about on the level of hunting spiders now its actually on the animal scale in terms of power to problem solve and identify things
  i was suggesting in that post that there are certain dumb processes that seem to get intelligentlike results more to do with a general morphogenesis in reality itself but there is a degree of abstraction and advancement when we get into virtuality / ideas / symbolic exchange / technology / memetics that requires a conscious intelligence to catalyze and extend this creativity into that level of abstraction that dumb biomechanical processes wouldnt have the thinking capacity to even touch on and to the extent that information does get carried through or inform dumb materials its only because intelligent animals are directing this
  it wouldnt be all code though is the thing there are too many complexly intermeshed material factors which are more unweildy and ultimately temporal
  says who there is no control group here we dont know what neural networks will be capable of in 10 years let alone the end of the century assuming there is some subjective key to our productive success is nothing but anthropocentrism
  material repair construction and even experimentation are well within the realm of robotics today its not hard to imagine something which can maintain itself better than we can in fact our judgements are more and more guided by computer models and algorithms we built because in specific application they are already far more adept at such things
  im well aware of the anthropocentrism argument and agree to an extent on some of the points but to the extent that it waves away the weird mystery and nextlevel productive capacity of consciousness i think its shortsighted not to say humans are the center of the universe or that there arent insanely trippy possibilities and modes of reality and productivity beyond our imagining i will give you that but i would say actually that our consciousness is the key to our success and none of these technologies would exist without our consciously shaping them due to our mental capacity to transmit complex memes technology or economic systems that we created may have some kind of dumb intelligence eventually capable of things we never imagined someday way beyond our capacities but i still wouldnt give it much more credit than id give a wellbuilt toaster or calculator like a couple machines might still be humming when humans have all been killed off by environmental catastrophe but that would only be due to some evolutionary superiority of their robust materials keeping it stupidly buzzing along for a few more centuries it would unlikely be functioning advancing or adapting in any substantial way if at all probably meeting its own materialecological challenges it wouldnt have the intelligence to think around and would essentially be existentially hitting a wall over and over in perpetuity
  the incentives / prompts
  but without the system achieving actual consciousnesslike awareness and intelligence  youd have no idea if capitalism is conscious even right now as if it really matters our attempts at comprehending emergent phenomena at that level is like an insect trying to do the same for a human  somewhat in check or answerable to humans  in what way is global capitalism in check even now i guess you might argue the few humans with the available resources could one day decide to play global thermonuclear war just for the sake of halting technological progress but otherwise theres no way any agent has a handle on this thing  the whole idea is that civilization is a bootloader and at the inception of modernity humanity is already completely captured  the imperative to consume for technological progress for liberty and recently to decentralize etc are induced cybernetically  whatever darwinian successes are fed forward are fed back through culture at increasing intensity  any attempt at widespread counteraction has to fight these forces  youd disseminate anticonsumerist disposition at such a massive rate to flip the positive feedback the other way that its basically impossible
  in what way is global capitalism in check even now  this did cross my mind of course thats more that we dont want to stop it because our own selfinterest/desire and on a collective level is a factor keeping it going but if we actually were forced to stop the system as a matter of survival we could in theory and there isnt some ailike skynet entity that would hold a gun to our head to stop us
define consciousness first     lets move further after that
  it would unlikely be functioning advancing or adapting in any substantial way  if we all died today yes do you really think we have hit any sort of technical limit though everything in tech is pointing towards selfsustaining systems not to mention everything in neurophysiology is pointing away from consciousness as a whole as crazy as dennett may sound hes the philosopher of mind who takes scientific discovery at its most literal if we are just a complex set of neurological processes we can literally just build a brain one day
  thats the thing its some ineffable thing we have and use and yet have no idea how to understand or locate it mystical views have their take and frankly science isnt anywhere near providing its own explanation    i think a lot of hyperrationalists would like to demean consciousness because it potentially comes across as too vital and woowoo but maybe it fucking is maybe reality is actually that strange
  nah imma feel we just trapped in language
  who knows
  shameless
  we could in theory  but we wont  its more like were hold the gun to our own head with a cybertronic arm being hacked from something elsewhere
  but there is a degree of abstraction and advancement when we get into virtuality / ideas / symbolic exchange / technology / memetics that requires a conscious intelligence to catalyze and extend this creativity into that level of abstraction that dumb biomechanical processes wouldnt have the thinking capacity to even touch on  level of abstraction that dumb biomechanical processes wouldnt have the thinking capacity to even touch on  
is he alright
  someone called him a boomer one too many times and he slipped
  based
  is this real
accelerationism is the only acceptable form of reactionarianism
  what about the form of neoreaction where fuck niggers and fuck janitors
  because when you actually try to write philosophy you want to say something as specifically as possible to make the argument youre making specific so that what youre saying doesnt imply more than you mean to imply look at kant he would be very difficult to interpret if it werent for that crystal clarity   since academics dont imagine a popular audience for their works most of the time they write for the academic audience so all the big boy terms are just professional shorthand
  they write their insane mumbo jumbo because it has no releveance no audience outside of adacemic circles    look at stem like engineering for example you cant write out mining processes and practices in deep phallus penetrates the earth as the man melds into the machinetime language lmao you have to write it crystal clear clarity because it actually describes reality and works with it     liberal arts is equal to iq destruction is equal to decay in edu
  muh sokal  
  and no its not just sokal its all liberal arts education
has somebody been following the latest nick land boomer rant what went wrong when did he stop accelerating and got stagnated in boomerism
      
  i wont defend liberal arts place in academia   but you clearly arent stem either  stem journal papers have no releveance no audience outside of adacemic circles except the closely related industrial circles  arguably many more people read philosophy books and papers for fun than people who read stem research for fun given the average person without a lab or industrial equipment cant put a large proportion of it into any practice  clarity in stem requires the use of terms with very specific application which appear meaningless or without proper connotation to those without education in the field as if arxivorg/abs/161101428 is more decipherable to the layperson than a few 3 syllable words usually parsable from context or at least in a referenced paper obviously they both require background
  was actually thinking this too
      i dont like her music but she seems redpilled
  your wife is just a means to please tyrone and chad isnt she cuck
    where to find qt art girls everyone in my art department is fat with dyed hair
  hes wrong though the boomer isnt someone who opposes progressives but in stead acts as the good goy who makes a token resistance against it and then will capitulate entirely to it and tell other dissenters that they should stick to the high ground and not become who they oppose even if it means they lose
  boomerism is subtle and cant be capture by a simple explanation specially since 30yo boomers came into the table
  you want to look not in to the art department itself but rather the various showings talks presentations that it or people involved in it put on promote or attend you start ingratiating yourself in to that scene and you will have a qt arthoe with an asymmetrical haircut who calls herself both a girl and nonbinary so she can still feel woke and edgy despite only ever engaging in heterosexual relationships with cismales and acting feminine
tldr accelerationism is angsty twentysomethings trying to justify their anticapitalism without having to do anything about it or give up their cushy firstworld lives
  i guess except for all rightacc people
  democracy is part of the human security system which slows down the process of acceleration towards the singularity    also disdain for proles re   predisposed in any case to perceive the politically awakened masses as a howling irrational mob it conceives the dynamics of democratization as fundamentally degenerative systematically consolidating and exacerbating private vices resentments and deficiencies until they reach the level of collective criminality and comprehensive social corruption  nick land dark enlightenment
  whats missing is consciousness which were not remotely close to understanding let along producing or simulating  the exact problem we may stumble upon or trigger such a condition without realizing it  
  dude be a degenerate to stop degeneration     its shit that makes you feel morally superior for being a super normie
  puppetmaster has nice puppies
  even if you have a ghost  
  stop degeneration
as usual for /lit/ everyone in the thread thus far is completely fucking wrong  accelerationism at its core and most essential is the idea that trauma causes sentience  its hilarious you guys think of yourselves as patricians  i could main this shit board in my sleep
capitalism is territorializing the accelerationist aesthetic how exciting and horrifying
whats the current deal with this guy did he give it all up and just embrace boring neoreactionary crap like blaming migrants or something
  traumas are a spook
  simplest answer is that technocapital singularity from the r/acc perspective isnt a given but rather a telos that can be disrupted land also has this thing about intelligence maximization being the only goal that makes sense as intelligence  competence at games  dominance swarming functional societies with low iq migrants is counterproductive to these ends but so too is the ethnonationalist exclusion of highly intelligent foreigners simply because of muh blood and soil in fact migration is a necessity for lands stated goal look in to cities as iq shredders he just laments humanitarian migration policies as damaging and looks to singapores cryptoeugenic immigration policies as a sensible working alternative
  from the r/acc perspective isnt a given but rather a telos that can be disrupted  this didnt used to be true until moldbug nrx types discovered land and started calling themselves r/acc    what old r/acc used to be is now called u/acc
  speed lots and lots of speed up your nose
  i would not be so sure of that although it is tricky to untangle the various accelerationist timelines and genealogies at this point i am pretty sure that in the universe i am from before the merger land was the one who crossed the streams with moldbug starting with a republic if you can keep it and then the dark enlightenment essays r/acc only came in to existence to differentiate itself from l/acc but by that time land was already fully in his current phase so there really isnt an old r/acc as the new r/acc came first and projected the old version of itself backward only people who confuse the analysis for the prescription u/acc has a falsified history too claiming to be a restoration of the original message cleansed of pernicious outside influences but much like protestantism which attempted the same only became something else entirely     of course all of these are named after a pejorative advanced  if not coined by noys who misunderstood what people were talking about anyway
  acclerationism is not about bringing down capitalism
  the point is nothing is brought down just transformed as it grows
  i actually think he might have come into contact with the new 4chan concept of boomer from his autistic followers and not realised it
  he has written two
  this is what a boomer struggling to remain relevant with zoomer culture looks like
fuck the gays
  even i get it and im a fucking pseud
  love it
  yeah the concept of boomer has accelerated past him and he hasnt realized it yet
  youre one of the most wrong here  acc doesnt give a fuck about sentience
is he alright
  hes right you know
  i have too low of an iq to understand even 1/3 third of what he and his epic nrx meme gang writes _    i want to be biodiesel _
what the hell is the outside
  if you have to ask you will never know
  noumena
  wtf does this even mean
  nondialectics     ai overlord doesnt need your epistemololgy ontololgy your reasons and your consciousness
  the leftright distinction is a false one but even so anticapitalism doesnt have to be leftwing
  mob rule wouldve produced better outcomes in 20th century america than rule by the intellectual elite though the biggest blunders entry into ww1 and ww2 1965 immigration act various woke judicial proclamations wouldve been avoided since no one would vote for them    i think its a bit bizarre to include land with reactionaries as he is an extreme liberal
  yes but that is still capitalism for the sake of capitalism disruption and destruction are just a part of it that aspect isnt something posited from a place of anticapitalist antagonism its already a innate feature and those that might recognize and maybe embrace that aspect in this case are not actually coming from a leftmarxist motivation but actually just going with it period     i said it either in this thread or another but left accelerationism was discussed very briefly and has completely disappeared because it was realized as completely missing the point by trying to force humanistic intentions into the dynamic
  where to find qt art girls  be a qt art boy as in an actually good artist    i just fucked one of these art girls last night and every girl ive dated over the last 6 years has been an artist its just artists hanging out with each other from what ive seen its not like people outside that culture can really relate to them
  given to an intuition although not to sensible intuition  perhaps this can also explain modernity as an occult locus the intuition isnt simply an intuition to a nonsense  but to nonsense in all its wittgensteinian negativity croaking artaud poetry from the asylum of social conventions the outside plays with our desire for the bizzare the unintelligable lovecraft and shoggothic insurgency put on superheated cybernetic critique and fed back into itself to a zero point of k or the extant collapse of intensities dragged across the body without organs
  i agree that accelerationism is a form of justification used to make you live with both sides  but why would any other potentially effective anticapitalist stance even require to give up my firstworld life   and also if youre supporting accelerationism you cant be lazy either theres work to do to enable capital
  since no one would vote for them  i dont agree angry mobs have been known to do the craziest shit imaginable
  i think its a bit bizarre to include land with reactionaries as he is an extreme liberal  oh its the same with jp disagree with him all you like but calling him a nazi is the pinnacle of delusion its just the time were in
i wish mm would come back
  it states that there is no possible way we can make capital serve us anymore  it never served us to begin with to quote from the mahabharata  bhisma to yudhisthira a man is a slave to wealth but wealth is nobodys slave o king this is the truth    any deceleration has been based in praxis also  anything less than full blown vargpilled kaczynskism is futile  one or two domestic terrorists aint going to do shit to the state one unabomber wont cause mass panic but a hundred or maybe even ten unabombers spread throughout the united states will
  thanks can you give some resources or more elaborations on when left right and unconditional acc was started and what its short history is so far
  what is a good artist more than a good looking guy whos dominant enough to shill his own stuff
capitalism is bad for people but good for progress  progress is good for people and bad for capitalism
im so bored but lacking in motivation i have a cold i had a small amount of junk food today just chocolate and sweets i cant be bothered doing anything productive in my free time    i have almost finished reading a history book which started out interesting but is now merely meh    i will have starboocks while reading right now
love you london frog
chocolate and sweets  better make that coffee black no sugar no cream
im also thinking about how if i had done everything in life beforehand as efficiently as possible id be really successful relative to what i am now eg university straight after school for only 3 years then get a job straight after and being promoted multiple times    but that is unrealistic because my social skills and interview skills were even worse back then than now its really incredible to think how much worse my social skills were than people who get internships at banks at the age of 19 it also hit home how bs the working world is    im also feeling sad because i never went to an elite university of public school and i missed out on all youthful fun
  regret is a silly thing i missed out on youthful fun too but tbhwyfrog its overrated i had my fun in my late 20s early 30s when i was somewhat responsible a lot of young people in those fun years get stuck with kids can you imagine that    also if oxfordbro is any indication you dont want to go to an elite university its a load of advertising my man scrub your mind of it and wash your penis
live in the moment my dear frog the present is too precious to let slip do this and the past will be something you begin to cherish
i have a cold too londonanon order in some noodle soup pretend you only eat it when youre sick and ignore the growing mountain of knock off pot noodles you have around your house
  i wonder what would have happened if i finished university i dropped out so close to the end now i cant find even a shitty job because im too old and i have nothing on my resume im so tired of fighting against depression im barely a human being at this point
    lol why would i stock up on any junk food i go out and buy it every single time fully confident on each occasion that ill never buy it again
  do you post in other threads or just the ones you make
  i meant the empties you numpty
    only rarely in other threads /lit/ is shit and a bunch of pseuds
  i appreciate on some level your lack of selfawareness
  thank you
u b in ma tang len practice annon
  then why do you come here isnt /r9k/ more your level
  on r9k hes just another drop in the bucket of piss and tears  plus you cant repost there
  whats your favorite book/author
    i dont want to say because i dont want to be doxxed irl yes i am that paranoid        i am a litizen lit changed not me
  all londonfrog does is read collect junk food drink coffee and occasionally show up to his job or get a zone 1 train somewhere he clearly hasnt looked up from his book in a while or has been indoors away from people with a cold because whenever he looks up from his book all he sees are sloaney staceys who hell never be with learn to back story we might not be on the same site as /a/ anymore but we still have standards    its alright petal we wont publicise the walking tour of your movements through london its not time yet
  i dont want to say because i dont want to be doxxed irl yes i am that paranoid  youre fucking useless chap at least entertain us
    i just had the mini epiphany that i should work for 12 hours a day because ive wasted so much time in the past few years of course 3 hours of that would be reading books and maybe some time for random shit but i am strongly considering it     i will have to call this a heuristic and not a rule because rules are spooks and no intelligent unspooked person like myself could accept any spook     how are you other uk litizens coping with life are you a normie who is set for life due to your normieness guaranteeing you career advancement are you a hopeless working class person have any of you people ever walked through the posh or hipsterish parts of london on a sunny day and felt the brute force of a lost youth
  hipsterish parts of london on a sunny day and felt the brute force of a lost youth  not from uk but i feel this every day had bad childhood trauma then i slammed straight into a failure of a relationship with my oneitis which ten years later still crushes me then boom  straight into family breakdown feels like after that my youth slipped past so fast in a blur of electric escapism because i was too anxious to do anything finished uni and got a normie job though just nothing in my past to give me strength lots of vague regrets and wishing about the future hoping it will get better
  i should work for 12 hours a day because ive wasted so much time in the past few years    i know this feel worked in my fathers business for 11 years with the intention of taking it over ends up being sabotaged by his gook wife who inherited the entire estate on his death now work as a manual labourer loading refuse sacks onto a truck  lift 7  10 tons a day covering up to 15 miles on foot  fuck off /fit/ hit midlife crisis early as i realise its too late to pursue the career i really wanted spent the best part of my youth working and still no house no gf only a few shekels in the bank     also aquired an addiction to japanese idol groups probably due to depression spend hours browsing pics and vids of chink girls in a launguage i dont understand    how can i find redemption after wasting so much time recently started reading nietzsche and am intrigued by the concept of the overman
  wishing about the future hoping it will get better    that will be your downfall anon you must become a man of action and assert your willpower leave the hopes and wishes to the weak minded go henceforth towards that which you desire and crush those who stand in your way
help a brainlet can someone explain to me what metaphysical even means ive seen it in multiple analysis and essays on literature the divine comedy one hundred years of solitude etc and it seems to me like im missing that dimension when im reading a book that metaphysical reading
  read stanfords encyclopedia page on metaphysics
  it can different meanings according to who you are talking with traditionally it has been identified with the metaphysics of western philosophy which is bound up with ontology when you see people like heidegger or kant talking about metaphysics they are mostly talking about metaphysics as ontology or as a study of being most academic texts will discuss metaphysics from this perspective there is another usage that has cropped up lately which is to identify metaphysics and metaphysical teachings as having to do with mysticism spiritual insight and initiation primordial wisdom etc this seems to have arisen as a result of people getting more into authors like guenon and evola here is an article where guenon talks about what he means by metaphysics between whats discussed here in this article and the standard western academic definition these two definitions are usually what people mean 90 of the time and the later case mostly only on /lit/ and in books about religion        now is it possible to define metaphysics as we understand it no  for to define is always to limit and that with which we are concerned  is in itself truly and absolutely unlimited and cannot be confi ned to  any formula or any system metaphysics might be partly described for  example by saying that it is the knowledge of universal principles but  that is not a definition in the proper sense and only conveys a rough idea  something can be added by saying that the scope of these principles  is far greater than was thought by some occidentals who although  really studying metaphysics did so in a partial and incomplete way  thus when aristotle envisages metaphysics as a knowledge of being  qua being he identifies it with ontology that is to say he takes the part  for the whole for oriental metaphysics pure being is neither the first  nor the most universal principle for it is already a determination it is  thus necessary to go beyond being and it is this which is of the greatest  significance that is why in all true metaphysical conceptions it is  necessary to take into account the inexpressible just as everything that  can be expressed is literally nothing in comparison with that which  surpasses expression so the finite whatever its magnitude is nothing  when faced with the infinite one can hint at much more than can  be expressed and this is the part played by exterior forms all forms  whether it is a matter of words or sym bols only act as a support  a fulcrum for rising to possibilities of conception which far outstrip  them we will return to this later
is the bookchemist really the only decent book youtuber who focuses more on classic lit it seems like its impossible to find analysis or reviews of nonya books on youtube
  paperbird is very good  unfortunately he doesnt upload very often
  i find him really pretentious his content is ok but it really seems like he wants to look sophisticated and literary its embarassing
there is a man a legend however im bot gonna post his name cause i dont want fags from /lit/ ruining him for me bookchemist is uninteresting imo cause he only goes for meme books and loves showing off swearing really cloyingly   i had trouble with ulysses because its just so fucking hard book
  lately hes being releasing modern american bs he used to be cooler
  hes good but i really dont care for a lot of the books he reviews
  oh come on if theres actually someone decent you know then just post his name please lit is not big enough to ruin anyone unless theres a reason to and the only thing ive seen cause that in the past is the person being a cute girl
  theres nothing inherently wrong with meme books he doesnt even browse /lit/
why do they always have those haircuts and that facial hair whats the deal with that
  whos they italians
  i think he means booktubers  im italian and i swear i havent seen anyone with a haircut like that since 2012
youtube is a waste of time
  fine op  idk which vid to recommend as an introduction he has thousands but this is a great playlist he has read everything and loves literature and isnt depressing in the slightest       
  hes been posted here several times
the goldenone is the best booktuber
  what does the golden one read
  what do you think hes reading
  you mean that gay autist who plays vidya and pretends the enemies he slays in fucking skyrim are his political enemies lol
  he read warhammer 40k books thats it i wish i was joking note how hes got fucking video game maps on the back wall
  doesnt he also read lots of fantasy
  he obviously does
  exclusively he pretends to to have read the backcover of like evola or something but we all know he didnt even try
pheusor
  he also recommended culture of critique
  that one kino literary autist who has a channel where he exclusively reads proust and has twentyminute long videos analyzing single scenes    he has like 8 subscribers but its art
  post him please
  its you isnt it
  proust  discarded
paperbird is worth checking out but im not sure if his videos are kino or pure shit watch the newest one and youll see what i mean
  he cute 
  yeah paperbird is really the only booktuber i like
i just applied to study mental health nursing  what books should i read
my diary desu
  give an excerpt from your diary anon
one flew over the cuckoos nest
out of mind by the dutch author j bernlef assuming you cant read the dutch original its a really well written story through the perspective of an old man that begins to suffer from alzheimers disease
  take lsd and read nietzsche
the curriculum
  mental health nursing     are you nursing or doing mental health these are two different schools nurses get onthejob or course training for compromised inpatient units substance programs mental health etc
  woke up stared at ceiling for 2 hours again got up and it was dark havent seen the sun for 4 days now my body aches and cracks like an old man despite being young stared into mirror got angry at reflection and punched it shattering the glass didnt cut my knuckles like last time masturbated but couldnt get it up so gave up microwaved leftovers to eat went for midnight walk through town yobs shouted something at me didnt hear what though got home and played vidya and drank trying to pass out but i didnt pass out i dont think i can anymore went to bed but woke up soon after and puked jack daniels makes me puke  30/11/2018  havent updated since then
  sazdfdfdf
  why with the fuckign comma
is reading them the blackpill
  all hacks better off just understanding really well the german philosophers of the 19th century and using them to understand now
  all hacks  you have read nothing from them
forgive my plebness who is on the left
  mcluhan
  mcluhan
  yes add bataille too
  implying mcluhan has said anything of value
  false
  jack parsons
whos the middle guy
  honestly you can probably skip mcluhan like just read the study notes on it  baudrillard and deleuze arent just great theory they are great writers too mcluhan is pretty basic on both counts by comparison
  baudrillard
bumping
  deleuze is not the blackpill fuck land for ruining deleuze
  you could almost say that land deterritorialized deleuze hehe 
bump
  t peterson
where should i start with baudrillard
  deleuze  blackpill    pick none
  blackpill  
baudrillaird has some interesting ideas but the other 2 are hacks
alliteration
since this thread is retarded and my question doesnt deserve a thread of its own is it a good sign or a bad sign that my creative writing appeals greatly to nonwriters and incites dont publish this but improve criticisms from yettobepublished writers

why do people think its okay to write poetry that doesnt rhyme
  im not a big fan of it either but i can look beyond that what really bugs me is that people think that poetry is just about creating flowery imagery to describe how they think of a woman what really bugs me is when they do that and then they also dont have any structure at all like i understand as an amateur not everyone is trying to perfect metering but to simply ignore any structure and say its a poem is stupid
  because rhyme is an unnecessary constraint its just one poetic device of many    the real problem is that thoughtful transgressors of the past made it okay for any retard to go full free verse with whatever crap they wanted and still call it poetry    i blame the modernists but also the beats and by extension the symbolists and transcendentals
  its good if the theme is good like paradise lost but sadly most of the time is just instaagram tier trash
  basically this paradise lost doesnt have rhymes throughout but i still recognize it as one of the greatest poems of all time     however   writing enjambed  lines just to make   things look like a   poem doesnt make it       poetry
  if it doesnt rhyme its not poetry call it something else
  thats still better than the structure most people try to use though i get metering cant be perfect but a lot of people dont even try their structure changes from line to line and has zero flow i dont expect a lot but as far as structure goes i could stomach yours as it at least resembles something simple like first fig
  stupid loli poster  will never fuck a roaster  in his mothers basement  he unleashes his defacement  upon the literature board  before he grabs the cord  ties the noose up high  kicks the stool and dies
my biggest problem with modern poetry is its just lazy good poetry is extremely hard to pull off and if you decide to break the rules you should do it willingly and not ignorantly     i wrote a series of sonnets and took them to an open mic night for poets here locally i revised and labored over these poems for a very long time it was mostly a snooze fest for the audience     some girl came up behind me and did a bunch of slam shit and the crowd was super into it i realized then that no one gives a shit anymore about whether or not you have talent     the way we consume entertainment is just changing i happen to think its for the worse
  you are so bad at this should have been  stupid poster of the loli  he will never fuck a roastie
  it doesnt rhyme  youre out of time  now i will dine  on your mothers behind
  i honestly think most selfproclaimed poets just dont fucking know what an iamb or a trochee is they have no formal training they just think writing down a bunch of random shit about their ex is worth a poem
  i dont even mind if it breaks some rules whe npeople are just trying to have fun but it seems like people dont bother to have any rules at all they just write incomplete sentences to make them sound old timey and use generic imagery with nothing to support it    even if its ignorant i could get past it if people simply did one thing right or were open to the criticism instead of just saying im just doing this for fun like its fine if you are doing something right but you cant do nothing right and then expect people to only praise
  lol fag
  i dont even mind if they dont adhere to that god knows i dont do it consistently i understand in any art form there are people coloring outside of the lines not for the sake of art but for the sake of just doing what they want    but my problem is those people writing about the ex and thats it theres nothing not attempt like rhyming is supposed to be pretty cringy by a lot of modern standards but at least it shows someone trying to maintain a structure or formula whereas most people just write inconsistent imagery about a woman and think its art
alright lets do this    what is good  what is bad    teach me i want to learn
  trust me i hear you i was an english major in college and had to sit through two poetry workshops with students who just refused to use any poetic devices that our professor taught us some of them would go a step further and just flat out ignore the basic rules of grammar because its meant to be spoken not read     the amount of times i had to bite my tongue in those workshops i lost count my professor actually pulled me aside and told me how much he appreciated the fact that i was virtually the only one in the class who genuinely tried to use what he taught us we still keep in touch nice guy
  how do you even get into poetry its way too cryptic for my taste at least with prose you dont need to guess what the author is talking about
  im not so great at it myself and dont know or understand everything about it but you gotta draw the line somewhere i just hate the poetry critique threads because its really just 3 people responding to a lot of shitty poems those people rarely respond and when you ask for criticism back they just say yuh i liked it but im not good at advice its just such a frustrating never ending cycle maybe im a bit hypocritical because my poetry is certainly far from proffessional but i get so angry when i read something and know that its just another list of random details about a girl or a moment with that girl    at least have some sort of story to it it cant just be some particular moment unchanging without any point    but the moment felt so good to me so i had to describe it  fuck those people
  prose never has metaphor or allegory  oh anon this is just sad
  bad too self congratulatory
  how so
  name the 20 most noteworthy poets you have read more than 50 poems by
  man you aint ever heard of blank verse you disgusting weeb faggot
  well its easier to understand as theres more context to the piece than just 5 lines
  some prose can be just as cryptic as poetry poetry gets easier the more you read it also its pretty much impossible to really dig into poetry without having a ton of foundational knowledge especially when it comes to history and religion
  how would not answering that question make it too self congratulatory im not questioning the criticism its self merely asking for why i may agree with it when explained why but i fear you think the poem might be about myself and its very much not
  its too direct and formulaic rather than a poem it reads like a direct speech with increasingly desperate rhyme do you not see the ugliness of rhyming smile and awhile or the awkwardness of fat lumbering lines like  the question remained unanswered as the sun began to set  the imagery is unimpressive a genius compared to a perfect statue passion compared to fire lies compared to a web   and so many trash words you your that this for how the entire senbonzakura of is makes you sound like an egomaniac
  this whole thread is unlearnèd af
  some things to consider  1 the rhyme scheme doesnt have to be all couplets   2 show dont tell   3 the scansion is a bit wonky some lines have 15 syllables some have 12 think about tightening that up and getting your lines to all scan something similar im a fan of the 10 syllable line
  you arent able to identify what is wrong with your poem this is most likely due to not having read enough poetry yourself as is the case with 9999 of people who post bad poetry on here and elsewhere online this applies to every artform that exists if you tell me the poets you have read i will be able to see where the biggest holes in your understanding of poetry as a whole lie and point you towards the movements you should focus on to broaden your knowledge if you cant easily name 20 poets you have not read enough    just tell me what exactly is wrong  no because you wont even be able to fix it because if you could you would not have this situation
   do you not see the ugliness of rhyming smile and awhile  i dont but that isnt to say i disagree either i try to play within my league and i think its more important to sound like myself than to try and sound smart and fail as it were this sort of advice i take as true but part of that natural progression of working on any given thing it is not something i can necessarily force my first go around but is something i hope i can improve going forward    a genius compared to a perfect statue  this is where i do disagree to some degree he is definitely not a genius but the idea of a perfect statue which generally reminds people of greek art is directly tied to the idea of a renaissance man to choose it as a random subject would be generic i suppose though not unforgivable for someone learning but the point behind the poem was to write something for someone who describes himself as an aspiring renaissance man it would be rather foolish to ignore these things in an attempt to be unique in my first try at something i think    lies compared to a web  there was nothing about lies though i can see why you interpret that but a tangled web doesnt have to be of lies it is simply that the ways i got him to stay in my life were very complex ill spare you the backstory     you your that this for how the  like above i do try to keep things simple in my early attempts because one thing that puts me off is people who ultimately sound pretentious in their poetry im not saying people who find ways to drop those words are pretentious themselves but a lot of people try too hard to sound sophisticated or refined or work around these basic words end up writing nonsense as a result they think they are talking like old timey people and it doesnt work i imagine as i move forward i will get better as it and especially with the more i read    my real concerns were of the structure and such not just rhymes but in general the rules of poetic story telling not the level of creativity though that doenst make your criticism invalid based on what op talked about and we all continued to discuss after
  you can read 20 poets and never understand the moves they are making in their poetry to truly unlock the genius in my opinion basic instruction and formal training is step one followed by several close readings of the best poets
  1 the rhyme scheme doesnt have to be all couplets   im nervous about switching up a rhyming structure too much because i know some people consider there to be rules for it im trying my best to color inside the lines first before i do anything too daring    2 show dont tell  could you tell me what you mean by this    3 the scansion is a bit wonky  this is something i want to work more on in general with my poems but im very happy with the strides ive made so far i am amazed that people are bale to be so amazingly consistent and hope to get there as well but am pretty happy when i can get them to just be close in length even if not perfectly
  well you didnt ask what poets ive read you set a benchmark minimum that i can admit to not having hit and it seems from there you intent is to say you cant learn if you dont hit this minimum which i find silly you can learn by doing and you can learn by observing a combination is best but when someone is open to criticism you saying you wouldnt understand my criticism is just a bit silly    the way you said self congratulatory sounded a lot more like an issue with the story told in the poem than of issues with structure and formula and the like    but if you dont want to tell me whats wrong thats fine just you know dont tell people whats wrong then you help no one but your own ego
  good fucking luck getting formal training in poetry  oh unless you mean university level classes i went there guess what happened    lecturers assign readings surprise its all poetry  students do not read said poetry because like you they are too cool to read said poetry and too busy being the rockstars of the poetic world despite already being older than rimbaud who read more books before he was 15 than they will in their entire life and wrote better poetry by the time he was 18 than they ever will in their entire life  students write poetry which i have to peer review and read  said poetry is about being a snowflake and sucks dog shit  realize i am among good company  lose all interest in writing poetry forever
  i think my issue is im not disregarding one or the other im the guy who wrote the poem not the guy you were responding to i read poetry not as much as hes listed off and i work at writing my own and im open to criticism and asked for more details on his before he answered i dont think hes wrong per se about reading more but to insist i cant understand criticism until i hit the arbitrary benchmark is silly i think both reading and creating are step one and they work well together
  like you they are too cool to read said poetry  i love reading poetry and have several books and of course look up more when i find an author that hits the good spot across multiple poems or sometimes even just one surprisingly good one you didnt ask what poets i read you set a very specific yet arbitrary benchmark and insisted if i dont hit it then i wont understand your criticism    lose all interest in writing poetry because some people in class took it for an easy a  im starting to feel really glad you didnt share your criticism it sounds like you just want to be pretentious anon i was really open to it too but i cant imagine you even knew what you meant by self congratulatory at this point
  im nervous about switching up a rhyming structure too much because i know some people consider there to be rules for it im trying my best to color inside the lines first before i do anything too daring  im not saying dont use rhyme im saying that you can use different rhyme schemes your rhymes feel forced and thats probably because of the aa bb cc dd etc     could you tell me what you mean by this  basically just think about how you can shorten your lines as someone stated before you have a ton of throw away words in here i cant write your poem for you but this line starts off with a mouthful of words you just dont need   if i dare you to touch that fire will i only feel cold    this is something i want to work more on in general with my poems but im very happy with the strides ive made so far i am amazed that people are bale to be so amazingly consistent and hope to get there as well but am pretty happy when i can get them to just be close in length even if not perfectly  at least youre working on it keep in mind that a nice tool is enjambment dont overuse it because it starts to feel very lazy when you overuse it if you think a line is running out of room just shift it down to keep a more even structure     my advice to you would be write a sonnet dont cheat follow every single rule to the letter for a classical shakespearean sonnet when you master that do it again and again youll be surprised how when you sit down to write another poem that muscle memory will click on youll be hyper aware of your syllables and stresses
  you set a benchmark minimum that i can admit to not having hit and it seems from there you intent is to say you cant learn if you dont hit this minimum which i find silly  no your primary vector for improving at an artistic skill is developing a discerning taste for what is conventionally considered wellcrafted and worthwhile within that artistic sphere which you do by  shock  reading or otherwise digesting whatever artistic medium it is you are operating in     if you do not read poetry you can write it but you will stumble around like a blind retard asking did i make it guuud because you have no clue yourself because you didnt read enough poetry yet    you wouldnt understand my criticism is just a bit silly  no you will understand it as you would criticism of any other artists work but you will not be able to implement it in any meaningful way because you simply do not have the ability to as someone who has not memorized a map of london cannot be expected to drive a taxi in london where using a gps is futile or someone who has not practiced mountain climbing for years cannot be expected to free climb a cliff face without falling off and killing themselves     you help no one but your own ego  the only help i can offer you is the advice to read more because thats the way it is criticism is only useful to people who are far enough along in their artistic development that their issues will not be rectified simply by observation alone
  i had a very similar experience in collegelevel poetry classes but i somehow managed to handle it like an adult it sounds like you just dont give a shit about poetry which isnt necessarily a bad thing i actually enjoyed picking apart bad poetry in the workshops
  meterrhyme
  if i dare you to touch that fire will i only feel cold  while i understand you cant write the poem for me and wanst suggesting that isnt giving an example of improvement a way to open up my mind most people i talk about allegory to could not recognize it for the life of them no matter how much you define it or tell them to but once you point out exact ideas in movies or tv shows they watch they become experts rather fast its hard to really wrap your mind around something without example how would you rewrite  if i dare you to touch that fire will i only feel cold  i often do feel like i have really long verses but often you gotta add extra words to balance them out with other ones its a bit of a hard line for me personally to walk between keeping things succinct but also making them match other lines in length but obviously the great poets do it so its something i need to work on    if you think a line is running out of room just shift it down to keep a more even structure   could you explain what you mean by this im sorry if i seem dumb i do think i am but i dont want it to hold me back if people are willing to explain things like im 5 i can learn      my advice to you would be write a sonnet  i will try this i avoided it before not just because of the syllables but the way words are stressed was something i legitimately struggle to wrap my mind around my experience is in writing screenplays which are almost the exact opposite of poems in my opinion they are as clinical as can be where as poetry is like prose squared any art in a screenplay is implied by the cohesion and execution whereas poetry is so much more about every little moment on its own i will try to understand the stresses again and give this a try
  your assumption is mostly correct but as for handling it like an adult  i didnt break into an hysterical fit in the workshops or anything thats just my perspective of what that kind of environment is like with all niceties stripped away because this is 4chan and also because they wont do the person i am responding to any good
  no  then you are contradicting yourself anon i do read poetry i just havent read the exact numbers by specific poets most of my books with the exception of a frost book tend to be compilations     you will stumble around like a blind retard asking did i make it guuud  i didnt remotely ask that when you presented a criticism i asked for more details on that i didnt come hejre to jerk off and if you read anyone of the other reply chains youll know that i take peoples advice to heart and simply seek more information so i can apply it    while i do see issues with it that doesnt mean i see all issues in it if you think that you are talented enough that you would always see any flaw you put into a work particularly a work of art then you are objectively wrong seeing poetry done right doesnt guarantee i will see what is done wrong in my own and having people explain what is wrong only helps    you dont want to help you want to throw out a two word criticism then insist im not going to understand it    you will not be able to implement it  sure i will by telling me what it is and combining it with your other advice of reading more poetry i will be able to do it but to insist on just reading and then never getting that advice i need to work on is silly for all you know i can implement it as well you are just insisting i cant because i didnt read a specific number of poems by a specific number of authors    the only advice i can offer you is the advice to read more  and to be less self congratulatory but you wont define it or explain remotely what you mean
  but as for handling it like an adult  i didnt break into an hysterical fit in the workshops or anything  i simply blamed everyone who took a simple entry level course as an elective for stopping me from pursuing it  so mature
  he didnt ask for niceties he legitimately asked for you to explain what your criticism was hes not complaining about how rude it was he simply asked for you to elaborate you find it easier to just rant and rave for 7 posts and no one else chimed in so clearly no one knows what you meant    assume someone in this thread is experienced enough to know what it would mean explain it
  i only said i cant write it for you because writing a good line doesnt just happen however i can try to offer some advice     think about the line what is it about its about fire and cold how can you talk about those things without simply saying the words fire and cold consider the color the sound the smell of a burning fire show me that fire instead of just telling me a fire exists     ex will frigid winds extinguish burning blaze   i know this isnt what youre trying to say but its an example of an iambic line with more show     enjambment is just when your line continues onto the next line     ex the dreamless dread of night weighed heavier  than sorrows of blah blah blah    i avoided sonnets but its such a good payoff when you do it and it finally works and when you go back and read your poem with tight meter and good rhyme you realize why the rules exist it reads so nicely
  see this just opened my mind a lot whe nyou first started off i was like its already a metaphor but i see what you mean here obviously i gotta get the wording right as touching the fire is really important to the story but even just playing with more synonyms would be really helpful for my future work even when im already using a metaphor    thank you seriously and truly
  and thanks for the info on enhambment i tend to do that a lot within a couplet but i feel uncomfortable when it moves beyond that as i generally find it uncomfortable in other poems when youre trying to get that poetic sound but it forcibly breaks up sentences to me
  i just havent read the exact numbers by specific poets  then read more do you think if i asked frost to name 20 poets he would say well gee anon to be honest i havent read all that many poets myself      i didnt remotely ask that  your post literally says what is good what is bad    if you think that you are talented enough that you would always see any flaw you put into a work particularly a work of art then you are objectively wrong  not what i implied or mean the depth of your ability to write quality poetry or create whatever art or hell do anything is directly correlated to your understanding of what works and what does not which is directly correlated to how much of that artform you consume actively consume i might add because obviously some moron who listens to some arbitrarily large number x of classical suites while he shitposts on 4chan and plays vidya will not be any closer to composing something good himself    you dont want to help you want to throw out a two word criticism then insist im not going to understand it  this is you covering all bases by dismissing my intentions and therefore being able to dismiss what im saying in the process because it being true is disadvantageous to you    sure i will  snip next post
  metaphor is just one tool in our box its about using all of the tools we have and blending them together thats when meh poetry becomes good poetry     youre on the right path and if you ever find yourself stuck and thinking this is too fucking hard to make work then you know youre finally writing poetry its not easy     good luck on your journey be prepared for no one to give a shit about your work its a totally thankless endeavor
  listeni can tell you are young probably early to mid teens because if i posted something on 4chan at around that age and people shat on it i would probably have reacted in the same way i will give you a very important piece of advice in this world for people who want to pursue artistic endeavors     no matter where you go and what you do you will mostly be surrounded by yesmen if you show your poem to your friends or family they will all nod their heads and say its great because they are your friends and family if you go to a college level and show them this poem they will nod their heads and say it needs a bit of work but is acceptable because you are paying to be there they have a job to worry about keeping and they are trained to coddle you when you absolutely least need it lest they offend some snowflake and cause a scene if you go to a live poetry performance and perform your poem at the very least people will sit through it and give a forced clap at the end nobody on this planet besides a very slim margin of people will tell you the harsh truth about the absolute lack of skill your poem displays when compared to that of even a veteran amateur poet and nobody will do these things because the majority of people who take up an artform do so because they want to be congratulated on a small scale for simply mindlessly doing things and dont care to improve in any significant way if you are not one of those people you should be able to earnestly look at your own work see that no matter how good you think it is it can be potentially 2000x better at all times even if you are at the very top of the world and as such you should be desperately with all energy in your body clawing your way to the next level and ready at all moments to mobilize and implement any possible kind of method which might help you to improve which includes my not so daunting task of reading 20 x 50 1000 poems which you could probably do in about 6 months if youre going at the pace i envision is healthy for the purposes we intend and your drive is at the level it needs to be to meaningfully improve and not just waste peoples time online giving you very specific feedback for poems that you could completely outdo in a few months by leagues if you did what i advised now i have to leave 4chan and do some work to justify my existence this is stuff you will figure out for yourself anyway if you seriously pursue getting good  which i hope you will because it doesnt do me any good to put you down and shit on your work contrary to what you said goodbye and good luck
  no but i think he would say it doesnt matter how many ive read at this exact moment if you got some fucking criticism give it to me you pretentious faggot    dont you    your post says something different than i claimed  yes thats what i said    all that other nonsense  at the end of the day you threw out criticism then ranted for an hour about how i wouldnt understand or implement it if you explained it no one had anything to lose by you explaining it so that even if it was down the road i could implement it you just assumed im too dumb for you to explain something to    thats pretty stupid if you dont want to share thats fine but you know go be an ass elsewhere im done other people are helpful
  absolutely i dont disagree at all i just thought you were taking it literally for a second when you suggested a change to it but i can definitely see thats not remotely where you were going with it    be prepared for no one to give a shit about your work its a totally thankless endeavor  i have a pretty nice following that enjoys my work even outside of what i normally produce so that isnt really the case but i udnerstand what you mean as a sentiment i made these poems so far just as gifts to show people what i think about them and our relationship and they were very grateful and some others who have read have done other things like design cards for them like in that picture and another one is even turning that one into a song which is why i posted that more than others for notes but i do understand what you mean as a whole
  ecause if i posted something on 4chan at around that age and people shat on it i would probably have reacted in the same way   see this is how i can tell you are young no one shat on it you didnt even shit on it you offered criticism and i just asked for more information look at everyone else who responded adn youll see its respectful people giving opinions and me agreeing with them for the most part and not being upset when i dont for whatever particular reason    i cant imagine you have anything else of value to add so im not going to bother reading beyond the yessmen because i have been very clear that im open to criticism my problem is that you refuse to give any
  enjambment has a good effect in the right context like in paradise lost its like the great truth of creation and man cannot be contained within the lines
  what about ozymandias and paradise lost then my personal distinction is whether or not it has a structured meter i prefer rhyme tho
  depends on the poet a lot of poets nowadays are either cryptic for its own sake or blatantly obvious many of the greats werent cryptic but used extensive metaphors in a style that we dont use today so it can be hard to keep track sometimes it helps to read an analysis and come back to it
  you will not be able to implement that anons advice  sure i will by telling me what it is  look i understand your frustration but the other anon is right as a poet etymologically a maker crafter or doer you are supposed to develop standards of criticism on your own if that anon was less kind he would tell you exactly what he thought was wrong with the poem and you would treat it as gospel that attitude would be in the wrong direction rather than trying to make something that can satisfy your own developed well cultivated tastes you would instead be obsessed with the audiences reaction do you want to be a whore anon    you need to read more poetry and from all different time periods contrary to your belief this is good advice because we are not telling you what you absolutely should and should not do in any circumstance but rather setting you on the path to becoming a poet who can recognize your own flaws and strengths reading poetry is not hard so i dont understand your resistance to it
  ozymandias  no rhyme  wat
  i blame the modernists  you should blame whitman right after blaming yourself for being a retard
  every damn high schooler knows what that is you pleb
  projecting this hard  not everybody is as much of a pleb as you are
  the vast majority of poetry ever written or spoken in cultures who had no notion of prose/poetry didnt include rhyming its like saying why do people think its okay to write music that doesnt use the same limited set of chordsoh wait
  vast majority of all things are shit
  my point was that poetry isnt a few short lines of uninspired jerky rhymes you cant write a poetic epic in solely rhyme nor a philosophical discourse homer wrote poetry and beowulf is a poem all oral tradition is poetry some fractions of which handed down to us transliterated number in hundreds of thousands of words
  you cant write a poetic epic in solely rhyme  blocks your path  
  you cant write a poetic epic in solely rhyme  divine comedy  speaking of i know nothing about poetry but am i right in thinking that the waste land was the last significant epic poem what happened to epic poems
  the average attention span has been shortened significantly by technology even among the intelligentsia
i saw a thread where a frogposter said poetry without rhyme is just segmented prose and some anon replied with pic related what does /lit/ think of it im personally quite impressed considering he had to have come up with it on the spot
is this prose poetry
  amazing
    paradise lost is written in blank verse its not rhymed but its still written in meter
  except the modernists didnt use free verse  can you even name a single modernist or a symbolist for that matter
poetry that isnt written in meter is just prose spaced out over multiple lines it isnt poetry
  except the modernists didnt use free verse
conflating poetry with verse  philistines
  its a nonce structure tho
  because they started with the greeks

he doesnt alternate between iambic pentameter and trochaic tetrameter
  rhyming poetry is for plebeian entertainment and always has been    take your rap lyrics elsewhere and happy hannukah
  whitman  i said transcedentalists you retard    fucking embarrassing please read more or do a web search before posting modernism is based on questioning tradition and experimenting and there is a shitload of modernist free verse    are you people even conscious

  ive always been on the other side    why do people bother with poetry that does rhyme    i always figured the point of poetry was expression why impose arbitrary constraints on expression and make it a fucking word game
  blank verse is fine but follow a meter
  because structures have effect the point of poetry isnt expression the point is whatever the inverse of empathy isforcing others to empathize    saying im sad about my ex gf is expression  the raven turns that idea into something the reader connects with  is affected by the rhyme provides entertainment also supports the central theme but thats a happy accident entertainment makes the piece more memorable makes the reader more connected more likely to internalize the material rhymes provide structure  also help internalization  memorization of ideas
  because poetry is meant to spoken and heard the structure rhythm and sound of it produces beauty and meaning the way music does also keeps brainlets out
  a poem is music made with spoken words rhyming is a tool for imparting musicality not the only one of course but a particularly effective one    also id like to remind all the illiterates in this thread that rhyming is not a core feature of english poetry that the modernists stripped away in a fit of depravity if anything it was a fad that stuck around for a long time because some of the goat poets wrote in a time when rhyme was in
  the point is whatever the inverse of empathy isforcing others to empathize  okay thats fine this is more of an elaboration than a negation and we can let that be the standing premise here    saying im sad about my ex gf is expression  yes it is a more shallow expression when expression is more creative its more aesthetically pleasing     the rhyme provides entertainment  i ask then what makes it so significant doodles in the margin would provide entertainment as well    rhymes provide structure  also help internalization  memorization of ideas  accounting for the cognitive weaknesses of the audience doesnt translate to something artistically valuable in my mind      because poetry is meant to spoken and heard   its meant to have value spoken aloud but if this is actually a dominant quality of poetry then its become a really bizarre art form distinct from the rest of literature also inaccessible to the deaf     the structure rhythm and sound of it produces beauty and meaning the way music does  music being a different medium from literature a marriage of the two is neat and cute but i dont see why such a thing should be a priority where literature is concerned in essence literature is about the communication of ideas if its not meant to retain its essential value as silent words on a page then its no longer significant as writing     i say let music be music let literature be literature it would follow from your claims that the deaf cant appreciate poetry wouldnt it i dont like that i care about what the artist is trying to express if the goal was only to express what is there to call for rhyme constraints theres the most powerful and appropriate words to describe something and then theres the ones that fucking rhyme come on
  correct he wrote spaced prose
  wow so nonrhyming poetry really is the pleb filter
  who said anything about rhyme im talking about meter any other aspects rhythm etc are things not exclusive to poetry its just prose spaced out nothing more theres nothing about it that makes it poetry
  tfw want to be a poet among other things  tfw cant write in rhyme  im able to write pretty good free verse poems but i cant call myself a poet if i cant rhyme
  lmao
  feel free to explain why its poetry
  you have no argument
  because it uses the subliminal qualities of language to evoke youre the one who out of contrarianism has attempted to redefine poetry in such a hilariously ineffective way that youve excluded the great 20th century poets
  because it uses the subliminal qualities of language to evoke  how is that exclusive to poetry  that youve excluded the great 20th century poets  wow i care deeply
  use a thesaurus like sylvia plath
  muh 20th century  every time
  truly the worst century
free verse retards think that line spacing is an aspect of poetry rather than an orthographic convention for making meter easier to read  lol
  sylvia plath was not a thesaurus she was a 20th century writer and poet
  by that standard rap is poetry
its meant to have value spoken aloud but if this is actually a dominant quality of poetry then its become a really bizarre art form distinct from the rest of literature also inaccessible to the deaf  the deaf are compromised listening to music no one said that poetry was meant for the deaf poetry is a distinct form of literature its distinct from prose  music being a different medium from literature a marriage of the two is neat and cute but i dont see why such a thing should be a priority where literature is concerned in essence literature is about the communication of ideas if its not meant to retain its essential value as silent words on a page then its no longer significant as writing    i say let music be music let literature be literature it would follow from your claims that the deaf cant appreciate poetry wouldnt it i dont like that i care about what the artist is trying to express if the goal was only to express what is there to call for rhyme constraints theres the most powerful and appropriate words to describe something and then theres the ones that fucking rhyme come on  i never conflated the two to suggest that they are the same what i am a saying is that music is just sounds but they are sounds in a specific order and pattern that evokes some sort of response from the listener similarly poetry has patterns that evoke a response from the listener for a reason that is not purely intellectually
  i know a theravadin monk who asks the sane question
biblical poetry isnt poetry  enjoy hell
  lmao slam girl sounds shitty but i 100 guarantee your precious sonnets are also trash by any metric but your own

philipp mainländer october 5 1841  april 1 1876 was a german poet and philosopher  in his central work die philosophie der erlösung the philosophy of redemption or the philosophy of salvation  according to theodor lessing perhaps the most radical system of pessimism known to philosophical literature mainländer proclaims that life is absolutely worthless and that the will ignited by the knowledge that nonbeing is better than being is the supreme principle of morality  on the night on april 1 1876 mainländer hanged himself in his residence in offenbach using a pile of copies of the philosophy of redemption which had arrived the previous day from his publisher as a platform he was thirtyfour years old
  the most /lit/ death there is not even a contest also he looks like a simpsons character
  apparently the philosophy of redemption is being translated into english finally
  good  i specifically came into this thread just to post english translation when  too bad itll probably take years and i wont be alive to see it
  a while back i tried to find information on the progress of the translation and found a reddit thread from earlier this year in which a poster claims to have spoken to the translator who is translating it as part of his phd you can read it here if you want  
  what took you so long it was translated into spanish in like 2008
i hope when the translation gets published it isnt one of those academic texts that costs hundreds of dollars
nietzsche immediately read the philosophy of redemption in the year it was published before any review had appeared the work caused him to move away from schopenhauers philosophy23 in his own works however nietzsche gave no attention to mainländer until a decade later that is in the gay science wherein he introduces the phrase god is dead could one count such dilettantes and old maids as the sickeningly sentimental apostle of virginity mainländer as a genuine german after all he was probably a jew  all jews become sentimental when they moralize24 on the other hand it has been suggested that mainländer was more than a mere influence and was instead plagiarized25
  nietzsche also mentions in one of his letters that he met an adherent of mainländers philosophy a quiet and modest man a buddhist passionate vegetariannote 9 the modest man told nietzsche that mainländer was in fact not a jew27
  hes right you know

has anyone got ralph matlaws revision of constance garnetts translation of notes from underground if so can you post a pic of the first page i was going to get katz version until i saw the first page and the voice was autistic rather than spiteful ive read the pv version but there were definitely issues with it
the voice is both autistic and spiteful this is why the book is so loved by both clever and autistic people both can understand it by heart
garnettfags must hang   t pv gang
  blocks your path
  it was autistic as in sterile and not showing any emotion rather than autistic as in getting overemotional but thinking that hes being rational

who is the matisse of literature
  raymond carver
  burroughs
  me
  fitzgerald
        how
  helene had her opinions she did not for instance like matisse she said a frenchman should not stay unexpectedly for a meal particularly if he asked the servant beforehand what was for dinner she said foreigners had a perfect right to do these things but not a frenchman and matisse had once done it so when miss stein said to her monsieur matisse is staying for dinner this evening she would say in that case i will not make an omelette but fry the eggs it takes the same number of eggs and the same amount of butter but it shows less respect and he will understand 
  matisse is known for bright expressive paintings which capture moments of intimacy and interpersonal relationships his paintings are soft and relaxed so too is fitzgeralds prose both dabbled around the french riviera read tender is the night for matisse personified
  why she so mad1/
  french domestics are very sensitive about their cooking
  cutouts
  the sun also rises
  julien gracq
  how is matisse so fucking good

spergler fags are the most embarrassing posters on this board its clearly the same cohort of illread pseuds who jump from one reactionary author to the next and spam the living hell out of them for a few months first it was de maistre then it was schmitt now it is spergler they talk of nothing else for they have read nothing else i wouldnt be surprised is they come from some gay discord circlejerk where they larp as the new rightwing intellectual vanguard its very embarrassing and annoying
  now it is spengler  um sweetie 4chan freaks have been obsessed with spengler as processed through low iq windows movie maker youtube vids for years now cringe licks your twink boy butt cuim here tickles your sensitive flesh little beast little rfeak nnmhmm im gona rape uya
  how do i development this prose style
  why are you surprised this board is full of brainlets just look at  or op we are talking about single digits iq
  more posts like this please
  honestly one of the best posts ive seen in a while well done
  follow xer 
  hoppe is that you
  sorry i dont use twitter
  cringe most people who read and accept spenglers philosophy are apolitical
  this but unironically also guenonfag and all those pseudohindu faggots who think that throwing around a couple of sanskrit terms makes them authorities on ancient spirituality and hierarchical social structures
ahhhh why the fuck cant i believe in jesus  what do i need to read it hurts so much i just want to believe
lol you sound like a pussy i bet i could believe in jesus if i wanted to
  you start acting like you believe and then the belief comes later but you dont actually want to change your life and live in christ so you wont do that until youve made the spiritual leap first which wont happen stop reading and start acting like a christian and you will believe or keep thinking about how to become one while reading books and you will not believe
jesus more like gaysus
  start acting like a christian  go to mass you mean its quite intimidating since i have social anxiety but i do want to go will i look like a fool if i dont know church etiquette and rituals like how to genuflect properly and all the call and response stuff
  yes go to mass no you wont look stupid and also start doing the things you know you should as a christian
wanting to believe a jewish scam  give me one good reason why you would want that
  and also start doing the things you know you should as a christian  ive prayed for the strength to but im still too cowardly
  god will give you the strength when you go out and act it will take time and be an effort and a period of pain and growth but you will see the changes and feel him in your life
 stanley hauerwas   he has youtubes and a beautiful memoir called hannahs child thats as readable as it is illuminating
  go to a good protestant church and skip all the smells and bells by acting like a christian you should be reading scripture daily praying a lot and trying to emulate christ in your actions not just going to church
  pick up and read
the truest christian is an atheist
newmans grammar of assent turned me into a believer  well not really but im no longer an edgy atheist and i take apologetics more seriously which is good
  tipped and fedorapilled
  im christian but i hate mass i never have any motivation to go i practice the teachings of christ and i agree with the kierkegaardian understanding where it is up to the individual to find unity with christ why must i go to a place to listen to a service in a foreign language im eastern orthodox but dont speak russian just to be in the same room as other people
same my morals line up with lots of christian beliefs but the extra step of faith is too hard ive just decided that ill be agnostic i dont know whats after life and neither does anyone else

  you confuse the body with the individual

  how will you pray and bring yourself to better karma without limbs and such a short lifespan restricted to a pre mature state unable to concieve of mortality
  so something like a life altering brain injury or an illness that affects cognition doesnt affect the individual
  yes
  im starting to think you might have suffered a life altering brain injury but at least you as an individual is unaffected  cheers your thread sucks
  can i drug myself back to innocence will that save me from the fiery hell that awaits me at the end of this life what if i cant fully believe in jesus
  but at least you as an individual is unaffected  true
  name one thing you are entirely responsible for as an individual
  everything if only i fully realize my potential for becoming the catalyst

  your everything is simply a byproduct of societys latest trends  your parents risky sexual behavior
  your everything is simply a byproduct of societys latest trends  your parents risky sexual behavior  only if i believe that to be true and exercise my power as the catalyst
  which suggests that both the arguments the individual is not affected by society and the individual is entirely determined by society have equal weight and the choice between them is arbitrary because its dependent on something as fickle as your mood on a given day
  samsara is a bitch aint it
  consciousness however is not
  are you kidding me
  debatable
  which suggests that both the arguments the individual is not affected by society and the individual is entirely determined by society have equal weight and the choice between them is arbitrary  except that the individual is entirely affected by society excludes the individual is not affected by society  because its dependent on something as fickle as your mood on a given day  i disagree once you harness the ability to become the catalyst there is no reason to turn back to being caught in the waves of someone elses boat    do you want me to be
  this is basically stoicism 101
    eh not exactly
  except that the individual is entirely affected by society excludes the individual is not affected by society  thats the point you have a choice between two mutuallyexclusive extremes and your argument for why one of them is true boils down to because i feel like it today     once you harness the ability to become the catalyst there is no reason to turn back to being caught in the waves of someone elses boat  ok so if you harness a power which you do not currently possess and one you do not have any evidence of then your argument is true
  ok so if you harness a power which you do not currently possess and one you do not have any evidence of then your argument is true  not totally sure what your question is here
  not really a question but more of a suggestion to you that you are completely grasping here you do not have any evidence to prove what you are saying and have failed to convince anyone that your method is anything but arbitrary in fact given that right now you are using a piece of technology that someone else created to parrot someone elses ideas only serves to prove the converse of your argument please finish your undergrad instead of wasting your life on halfbaked theories
  you are completely grasping here  i dont think i am  in fact given that right now you are using a piece of technology that someone else created to parrot someone elses ideas only serves to prove the converse of your argument  what does this have to do with anything
  ok youve already proven my point very well but heres one last question     if you can simply believe things into existence by using the self as a catalyst why bother replying to posters who disagree you dont need to convince anyone so long as you convince yourself right
  if you can simply believe things into existence by using the self as a catalyst why bother replying to posters who disagree  its fun thank you for having this convo with me   you dont need to convince anyone so long as you convince yourself right  no im not trying to convince anyone its impossible to convince other people of something outright if they already have an opinion on the subject in question

shirers rise and fall was a good text in its day but theres no need to read that when rj evans third reich trilogy exists now
  it takes the nuremberg trials at face value and shirer constantly feels the need to inject his own opinion it is best to read multiple sources so you can form your own opinion i would recommend hitlers revolution by richard tedor after finishing the rise and fall of the third reich

  god tier meme vs literal who literary fag  heh nothin personell
i wanna start taking notes while i read but i dunno how to go about doing it what are some ways you guys typically do it how do you know what to highlight/underline specifically with fiction or philosophy
  youll have to find your own personal way to do it just start by marking anything you find literally noteworthy things that make you shiver or that you disagree with passages with nice prose or concepts or images that strike you hard whatever  youve listed some common forms of marks which are good ways to begin theres also the ubiquitous color coded postits which have their use especially for anything you want to reference repeatedly again youll just have to find what makes it stick best for you personally   another thing ive tried was having another sheet of paper close by and jotting down thoughts as they came and then going back through them after reading each chapter or section to refresh and recontextualize everything
  im currently reading a text once and then once again to underline its most important parts sometimes i read a paragraph and then read it again to underline its most important parts too this method is faster than the first one    then i read the underlined parts and start taking notes in a notebook with draws and schemes and whatever means i find useful    and then i read the notes to try and memorize them from the very start and once i achieve that i consider the notes and the original text studied    in the future i want to read the text once to have a vague idea of its contents and then once again to start taking notes    i also want to watch any matterial related to the text im studying so i can understand it better and be more motivated about it    so i would be studying the origins of israel and then watching that dreamworks movie about moses for example
  why do you want to take notes is it because you have trouble remembering concepts from what you read or because you have this vague feeling that it is a good idea
  i think taking notes would encourage me to read more actively and have a better understanding of the work im reading
  you cant read passively
ok ignore these other retards and just listen to me you cant take good notes if you have high testosterone distracting you so before you take any notes make sure you go jerk off this should buy you about five or six minutes of good quality note taking copy down the first word of every sentence for as many pages as you can skim in the time and when you have about 2 minutes left see what sense the words make together then write down how that makes you feel    repeat as needed until you finish the book

a man with wealth unearned wants to at last create something worthwhile  everything in his life has been inherited   he has never accomplished something on his own  he tries to bribe someone with talent to create art out of the childish thoughts lingering in a man who would willingly hire someone to express his soul for him  the only story there is the story of someone who can only create art through the inevitable tragedy of his life   a life enriched by the death of others and a life doomed to end in the same pathetic form it would have with or without money
  where do the ghosts come into it though
  the ghost are the pale reflections of his own soul being reflected in the writers such a man hires

  how so

step 1 to being a moslem is not reading any books except the quran which is only supposed to be in arabic so you memorize it without actually knowing what any of it means     then you are ready to buy you cousin hand in marriage and have a litter of retarded children
  youre everything thats wrong with modern man weak spineless defeatist and worst of all a traitor i recommend reading the numerous annotated versions of the quran to see how disgusting the islamic ideology truly is
  youre everything thats wrong with modern man weak spineless defeatist and worst of all a traitor  thats how your ancestors got christian in the first place
  i recommend reading the numerous annotated versions of the quran to see how disgusting the islamic ideology truly is  could you name some examples of the horrors you have encountered
  there is no such thing as islamisation it is just racial replacement 2nd gen muslims only become radicals out of a sense of anomie and identity crisis and not refugees or 1st gen immigrants because they are thoroughly acculturated to their home nations and peoples once they become the majority they will feel more at ease being degenerates islam is a thoroughly dying religion and will remain so as modernity holds even the wahhabi stuff is just a petrofueled political cult of subservience to al saud the imams of mecca now sing songs praising mbs
  i know the c word is dirty on s o y channel but it definitely applies here     no matter what isis tries to tell you in your fb messages islamism is an ethnic ideology you will never be truly welcome in muslim europe you will at best know your place
  cant help with the sort of textbook knowledge you might be looking for but theres a ton of fantastic novels memoirs and essay collections out there oran pamuks istanbul is cited with speak memory in terms of beauty hisham matars the return is good for getting a sense of how wealthy progressive families have navigated their totalitarian governments endure the first two chapters and it picks up significantly and porochista khakpours sons and other flammable objects might give you a sense of how 15 and 2nd generation youth might adapt to western life    ill come back if i think of any others
  islamification is just a codeword for racial replacement that takes arabs fanatcial religion into account they have intense racial solidarity when it comes to white conquest they might squabble here and there but they ultimately know their true loyalty death of the west
  islamification is just a codeword for racial replacement  a very poor term because islam is just the paintjob on it and even that is poorly down and chipping     they have intense racial solidarity when it comes to white conquest  lol arabs are incredibly dysfunctional and tribal panarabism even under the cloak of islam has failed miserably thanks to the gulf state money which trumps all religious and racial affiliations as we are seeing forget whites who are just a bland vague enemy who did that crusade thing one time and are termed alrum romans by the shiekhs the jews who have taken the third holiest site in islam and are specifically mentioned as the worst enemy of muslims after satan look at the racial solidarity when it comes to confronting them as you can see there isnt any if ever there were a litmus test of panarabism and panislamic zionism would be it all arab govts have sold themselves to usraelies and the ones who havent live in ruins while the ones who did laugh at them
  youre telling me that multiethnic arabs wont side with another arab over a euro that balkanization wont im not talking about oil princes here im talking about the waves of peasants infesting our countries
  the inevitable islamisation of europe  houellebecq actually never claims that nor would any man in his right mind claim it submission is 1 a satire and 2 a very honest statement that the sexual morals he seems to proclaim are quite similar to the ones some conservative muslims advocate which is quite astonishing at first glance since he once said islam is the dumbest religion ever when he promoted plateforme but not really astonishing if you know his works    which books should i read about it    a nice introduction into the history of islam
  youre telling me that multiethnic arabs wont side with another arab over a euro  its not really happened before the saudis had no problem siding with the west against saddam or assad allied with the russians rather than fellow arabs saudi even went into coalition with the israelis in order to cuck iran most arabs believe themselves to be white anyway
  if there were some horrible hellscape race war where there was no holdsbarred and your skin was your uniform maybe they would more likely they would just do what they could to save their family which may include selling their fellow arabs to the authorities a moroccan and a syrian can hardly even understand each others arabic dialects let alone feel like they are united they are just atomized capitalist communities who become radical in the language of their forebears in a desperation to maintain some sort of identity they are powerless
all you need is a quran  hadiths are larping at best and bidah at worst  never mind the jews and incels with muh horrors if you bother to read it its far more mild than the old testament and talmud  jews get butthurt because it explicitly calls them on their shit the horror
  our countries  our countries i mean seriously you and some of your buddies own some countries or how am i supposed to understand that pronoun   waves of peasants  back it up with data dude
  what about white ethnic groups which are predominantly muslim like bosniaks or chechens
youll be speaking mandarin before you live under sharia law you dumbfuck
     one good post in the thread recommending prizewinning authors across multiple genres   rest of it is reactionary hacks screaming over each other  fuck it im out
  yes i agree its better not to react to problems and just let the progressivists charge forward unchallenged and hope for the best high five fellow woke person i too am out of this ignorant board and heading back to r/politics for some real content
  they strongly associate their religions with their ethnicity islam is pretty much the only thing that differentiates a bosniak from a serb they speak the same language
  not passively accepting your fate is being a reactionary    people fault op not for wanting to learn about islam but for his defeatist motive
so is the hope basically that muslims will liberalize like christcucks have in the west it seems whitey has gotten to radical in either direction so the capitalists just want to drown these people out with outsiders eventually
  chechens are inherently nationalistic they couldnt care less about being accepted into this international caliphate or whatever else the gulfcucks come up with their only wish is to achieve independence and live peacefully in the mountains  t chechen
  muslims have enormously high rates of pederasty and cousin major in their countries and then inordinately high rates of interracial sexual assault when in european countries
  could you pinpoint where exactly it says in the quran that its okay to fuck little boys and rape white girls
  fucking little boys is forbidden raping white girls is allowed provided you turn them into slaves beforehand note that you cant make a muslim a slave although technically it would not be considered rape anymore
  its a racial thing but muzzies seem to just rationalize it somehow i think youre missing the broader implications which are twofold first islam is arab imperialism thats why it was spread with the ultimate intent of arabizing autocthonous and ancient races like berbers copts and persians secondly islam is essentially a warrior cult for subdominant homofaggot bug races like bengali pakis modern iranians levantines and moroccans and the social and politicla mandates it prescribes are more guidelines for preventing those types from disintegrating back into tribal warfare or paganism than they are a system of wholesome ethics islam allows polygamy cousin fucking murder and rape of kaffir and seems to be enormously ambiguous regarding pedophilia especially towards girls see the founders of the faith but probably i would assume fucking boys which is a time honored pass time of both the arabs and the west asians     really gross and should be wiped off the face of the planet with glee hatred and indifference to their suffering
muslims are inbred mongoloids the idea that they can conquer anything in their present state is laughable    muslim women in the west are complete sluts which youd know if you spoke to any the men who turn into terrorists are for the most part incel petty criminals some of the bataclan guys were drug dealers for instance how very pious and traditionalist who resent being proles and get radicalized by their imams because of this much like /pol/fags and nazism    pictured the terrifying babyface of islamic violence
  hurrrr it says be kind to orphans it doesnt say not to rape them  notes a failure to cite the quran
  houellebecq convinced me that the inevitable islamisation of europe isnt so bad  than you are much dumber than the average leftwinger
  i know the c word  cuck
  muslims will tend to have more in common with muslims  back it up with data  lmfao
  how is it dying at all
jesuss return and kalkis arrival will precede the destruction of global cultures by islamism in my belief so you neednt worry
  islam is going to be europized hoellebecq has it backwards imo
  islam is going to be europized  most of the signs point towards the opposite    christianity is a dead religion in europe so if there is ever a religious revival on the continent islam is the one most likely to lead it due to it being a growing influence that refuses to back down to sjws

  5 kismet by luke tredget  she shuffles her head closer to his cock close enough to smell her own residue and then takes it in her mouth with the vague idea of cleaning it geoff mirrors this gesture by burying his head between her legs and gradually she can feel his cock pumping up with blood one pulse at a time until it is long and hard and filling her wideopen mouth they stay in this position for a long time anna sucking and slurping with the same lazy persistence youd use on a gobstopper or a stick of rock eventually she loses her sense of the context altogether  of what she is doing or who she is with or where they are  and becomes an empty vessel for what feels like disembodied consciousness she looks at the window and wonders how the glass feels encased within its wooden frame what the shaggy clouds feel like being blown across the sky what the walls felt like being splattered and smeared with wet paint     6 graces day by william wall  hes almost weightless when he enters me it hurts and my pain belongs to the subterranean world primitive as the clay his body is slacker than i expected a small paunch begins at his waist and settles in a downward parabola to his groin his pubic hair is red his erect penis is a surprise although i had imagined what they would feel like read about them seen them represented on toilet walls and magazines i didnt see it before he entered me but afterwards it is small and sticky and amusing i want to touch it but i dont dare i dont know the etiquette he is twenty or more years older than me this is sex    7 the paper lovers by gerard woodward  he was aware that she was making a mewling sound as he put his lips to her tightened nipple and sucked her mouth was at his ear her tongue travelling along its grooves voice filling it his mouth tugged at her extended her she snapped back there was a taste of something on his tongue in his mind he pictured her neck her long neck her swans neck her alice in wonderland neck coiling like a serpent like a serpent coiling down on him she had found a way through his clothing and her fingers had lightly touched his cock then slowly began to take a firmer hold he wanted to cry like a baby he felt helpless as though his body had come undone and she was fastening it he felt as though he was bleeding somewhere then he felt powerful gigantic he would have kicked a door down
  he sucks on the hard nipple    he has never done this before and yet no wait of course it is totally familiar    the first thing he ever did    this is by a distance the worst idea in any of them    everything transformed and yet nothing has changed at all    i used to curl out shite like this when i was 16 and thought writing was easy

    underrated post
  nope i also havent read most of what i listed
  no wonder  the romance of three kingdoms and rumis poems only make sense within their respective historical geographic and cultural contexts  the 1001 nights is mostly fanciful stories written for the sake of pleasing women children and idleminded men  it makes very little sense to study any islamic poetry or chinese fiction without having read the quran confucius doctrine of the mean and at least a few books on their respective regions histories despite the meme starting with the greeks wont actually give people the universal key to understanding the world nor should anyone ever attempt to do this instead it would make more sense to first learn the generalities of world history and geography and to afterwards specialize on a certain region of the world during some time period  thats what experts do and i have no reason to believe that permavirgin basement dwelling neets here on 4chan shouldnt do the same even if its just for the sake of sharing their acquired knowledge with other anons
  im reading through anthony kenny history of western philosophy and dk books big ideas simply explained series to get a very rudimentary knowledge of most things     probably not the best way since its incredibly basic but its how im doing it i just assume most the people who says ive read the greeks are just memeing anyways
end with the greeks then start with the greeks again rinse repeat
      do you need people to handhold your way through literature  literature isnt a trail in which you can just pull out a roadmap  think critically have some interests of your own and youll know what to read next
  any babylonian or arabic poetry you would recommend starting with and is there any worth reading from the egyptians
  probably right im a classics major and i still havent read all of the official /lit/ greek prescriptions personally i prefer to jump around through history i want to make sure i have a basic knowledge of all parts of the canon before i commit to getting too in depth in one specific area
i think i know the answer already but whats the consensus on stephen frys retelling of ancient greek myths
  in the case of fiction and poetry you are right for the most part but tis not so in the case of philosophy and history considering the fact that most philosophers will mention concepts that were first thought of by other philosophers hundreds of years before them and assume their reader must already know what they mean  likewise history happens as a process wellfounded structures like imperial chinese bureaucracy or knights orders in many european countries will usually only make sense deep in context as relics from a far bygone time
  serious question what happen after you begin reading about philosophy does fiction and every other hobby is not amusing anymore    is philosophy is the ultimate hobby
  what now    find a underage young boy and sodomize him
  based socrates poster
  it really all depends on what you are like if you like to understand reality by the means of categorizations and seek for an ultimate truth there will be very little in fiction that will be able to appeal to you you might seek for correct forms instead of emotional experiences  if on the other hand youre more of an empathising emotionsdriven person youre much more likely to find fiction as a place where you can find comfort or seek to understand other peoples feelings  if youre neither and just enjoy plot for its own sake youll probably never stray too far from genre fiction and philosophy might not really do much for you at all
the map is not the territory was he right

are there any true crime books worth reading
i wrote a fantasy novel then i did something totally different for nanowrimo and i won it actually learned alot now i want to go back to the fantasy novel and basically rewrite the whole thing its 56k right now but i have more ideas and think i can get it to that 90k mark     i wrote a prologue today and would like to get some feedback wont post story summary because its the first chapter this should stand on its own    
  theres some good stuff there but consider cutting the first couple of sentences and starting with the dialogue also the lambs fleece was black as coal anon no
  yeah i hesitated on that line will prob change if i can think of something better though precious stones are important in this world house symbols being things like emeralds and rubies and was thinking when a villian takes over in book two he changes his familys crest from a diamond to coal
  this is a rough draft btw i see errors in it already just letting you know
im worried its too short where can i expand this a page is about 240 words so this is just under three pages i would like it to be around four
congrats on winning anon 
  nice
please op before you write another word please learn the difference between its and its youre embarrassing yourself
should i read the debut romance novel by pride  prejudice actress and twotimeswife and twotimesdivorced ex of elon musk       she also played a fuck toy robot in west world i dont want to miss out on her unique twisted world few or do you think its basic has anybody read
a bold intelligent and modern love story which reminds us that the most powerful relationships are not so much about two people finding each other as they are about that most human quest to find ourselves  bernadette is expert at hiding the truth  she has built her career as a journalist on her talent for lulling powerful men into a false sense of security then exposing them in her ruthless profile pieces  but in radley blake she may have met her match immune to her charms he seems to see through every layer of her carefully constructed act right to the truth of who she is inside    how much of a selfinsert will that be  makes me think  do all romance novels have character trait selfinserts   and who writes more romance men or women
    why why must you torment me with these jezebels every day i come to /lit/ and every day its the same thing incredibly attractive cuties posing coquettishly for the camera as if to seduce the reader as a celibate person i must protest these puerile distractions they have nothing to do with the subject of literature and only celebrate the lowest of low culture please go with god
how the fuck did he go from that to grimes
  he did date other blondes inbetween but he should really stop that and go with women his own age
why didnt elon have babies with her why did he divorce her two or three times shes so hot and she looks like shes a kind person
  how did he go from a talentless whore with no personality who gets by on her looks alone to a charismatic accomplished musician with a great personality    he stepped up bigtime amber heard is obviously a boor
  /mu/ pls go
  grimes  accomplished musician with great personality  kek she is just about the same as riley if it wasnt for her face and autistic personality that aims to persue teens her music career would be long gone in the trash  inb4 but grimes is an ugly goblin lmao  thats relative her face and personaliry aims for a specific group and its no denying fact that she refused a lot of producers because they would only help her in exchange of sex  if that goblin brangs about being so much asked for sex in exchange of favours then imagine how many dicks your average pop star celebrity must take in the ass  the music industry can be just as bad and shallow as the cinema industry
  why do i want to look like this
  why do i want to look like this  because looking attractive is validating and makes life easier
  why is he wet
  go with women his own age  nice try roastie
 i found the whole reading experience perplexing it is superficial trite inconsequential and often painful the beginning felt promising but it gradually disintegrates i only finished this book as i needed to review it otherwise i would have given up before halfway it is comic at times because of its inherent stupidity but i felt generally unsettled as the narrative never feels grounded   the author has obvious writing talent but it is frustrating to see this as an end result of her hard work her potential is not realised in this novel and i am sure she is capable of so much better she needs to find a niche and use these talents in a more worthwhile direction to give a 1 star is a bit grim but i am afraid i found it disappointing and boring i guess there is an audience for this simple romantic fiction and if so needs to be marketed in a different way not recommended for a reader of general fiction i am afraid     unfortunately this book totally irritated me form the start with its overtly flowery language  this did nothing to disguise a flimsy predictable plot i didnt warm to any of the characters probably because they were all presented as caricatures if that was the point then i didnt enjoy it     to me this is one of those books that you either hate or love i hate it i found the character quite shallow and unlikeable i also found the writing a bit clumsy and there were too many occasions where the author waffled on and on about something that wasnt very interesting to me and therefore bored the hell out of me     seriously bad novel both the story and the writing i read the very mixed reviews before buying but really wish i hadnt struggled to get through this
  well said anon no more jezebell
  novel  by  actress      no
  based jezebel poster doing gods work in every thread
  looking like that is boring though i want to look like this
one of the best human beings of the 20th century prove me wrong
the situationists are at the precipice of postmodern schizoanalysis carrying a deleuzian framework outside of its vitalist coding into the blackest night of materialism all cows are black but the slaughterhouse still operates at the intersection of two and ten the system of objects was the inertial bend of marxian dialectics into the autonomous  the shadow of the hierarchy is the death of our god and nietzscheland cracks the very topology of time and its fallout fracture    baudrillard loses himself in his own simulation and couldnt be happier nozicks machine is almost at peak operational capacity waves flex territorialities from fractures not yet realized retrocausalquake imminent to the outside the platform of the tachyonic intersects in every direction but the present    debord expected proliferation of technology to drive media further into the unidirectional fashion cementing a top down structure of spectacles sos s 24 here lies a mistake which the situations were doomed to from the start  the hierarchy is imagined always as doomed to centralization hermetification and incest    kafka is king here his inescapable bureaucratic nightmares always tend towards decentralization see the laws and how each law after the first is even more terrible than the first  there is always another higher source just behind the door why k couldnt get a straight answer the defining feature of centralization is a straight answer which coincides with a madness far greater than the ever lucid kafka imagines    centralization is a tying of a knot the tighter the knot the stricter the flows  to centralize is to collapse the labyrinth into obstructionary rubble this is why deleuzes framework always lapse back reterritorializes the situationist schizzes like the hand of oedipus baudrillard for instance cannot abandon the anthropocentric desire inherent to the object a hyperstitional force of automation and transhumanist scifi modus operandi     this suprafunctionality of human consciousness is in the end what automatism strives to echo in the object in a way that parallels the formal selftranscendence of the human individual automatism aspires to be a sort of ne plus ultra of the object that perfect and perfectly autonomous monad which is the governing dream of subjectivity is thus also very clearly the dream that haunts objects soo p 112
  this is to say while baudrillard first imagines the autonomous objects as horrorcore bunuel and the partial object of the detached hand he cannot help but reterritorialize it in the self his selfproducing robot is nothing destined for escape total automation for baudrillard and perhaps the 60s as a historical moment at that moment the autonomous object was an incestuous sterilizing process    when it becomes automatic on the other hand its function is fulfilled certainly but it is also hermetically sealed automatism amounts to a closingoff to a sort of functional selfsufficiency which exiles man to the irresponsibility of a mere spectator soo p 110    but the autonomous object and its respective heirarchy can no longer be seen as something hermetic and incestuous baudrillard fixation on the analysis of robot sexuality can be seen here as a symptom of this anthropocentric disconnect the autonomous object by definition must have its own set of goals intentions whether you side on the semantic qualification of natural or synthetic the conflation of intelligence and consciousness is wriggling out of its protoanalytical shell to be tested in the flames of history      the situationists pose a radical break in marxs project to the degree that it is almost easier to imagine them as neoyounghegelians they precisely did not want to dial marx back into the realm of quibbling social critique  they unleashed marxist dialectics into itself they were portents of the passing of the reigns a resignation of signs to the hierarchy and we still havent listened    what is upon us isnt from the inside and as such must be approached as the alien that which goes unburned is holy like shadrach
which portions of this book do i need to take with a grain of salt    i get strong muh 6 gorillian vibes from a lot of the numbers
  inb4 asshurt commies
dont read peterson meme books
  i dont regret it because it already had one of the most beautiful paragraphs ive ever read granted it had nothing to do with commies    the glaciers came and went the granite boulders littered the shores of the lakes the lakes froze during the solovetsky winter nights the sea howled under the wind and was covered with an icy sludge and in places froze the northern lights blazed across half the sky and it grew bright once again and warm once again and the fir trees grew and thickened and birds cackled and called and the young deer trumpeted  and the planet circled through all world history and kingdoms fell and rose and here there were still no beasts of prey and no human being
  lit is incapable of discussing this book just read it and form your own opinions
  another problem im having is that the author is purporting that prisoners were surviving only on a few ounces of bread and water for years at a time that seems impossible to me
  he talks about packages from the outside a lot people died in droves by his account as well consider reading more carefully
  the and the the and the and the and the    this is the most beautiful shit you have ever read you are a fool
  no bully
question the гулaг narrative thisisfine  question the holohoax narrative go to gulag
  which portions of this book do i need to take with a grain of salt    all of it it is well known that he wrote it originally as an account exaggerated folk rumors but then pretended it was an actual empirical account once americans and british showed him the potential propagandabux still a good book but it is not a good source
    reddit
  doesnt even know what a polysyndeton is  embarrassing
  literally none my maternal greatgrandfather spent 10 years in a siberian gulag and told me all about it everything he wrote is true
  i can read about 390 wpm and still pay attention anything faster i miss things how long would it take for me to read i read about 2 hours everyday on any given book
  first tell me how to achieve such speeds
  all the numbers for a start he had no access to good sources so its either extrapolations or more or less educated guesses     i personally consider it a collection of annecdotes which by themselves may not be correct but still form a coherent whole     i personally consider it a great book both as history writing and literature since i like the way he writes with his dry sarcastic humour
  practice large science fiction novels help
there are great documentaries about disgusting shit comies did in my country but they have no subs so i cant post them
  pretty much all of it its a novel finding some sort of guidance in it despite it not being actually true isnt the worst thing in the world just make sure to present it that way ive analyzed ghost stories to a socialist end and obviously those arent factual its not taking the message to heart its saying yes this thing is true read this for truth
  dont bother reading it solzhenitsyn is a garbage writer who was given attention because of the cold war
stalin is based
probably 50/50 true mired in controversy it wont show you real evil or whatever dumb retarded shit peterson says this is from wikipedia and accurate    solzhenitsyn documented the soviet governments reliance on the prison system for governance and labor placing doubt on the entire moral standing of the soviet system the government could not govern without the threat of imprisonment the soviet economy depended on the productivity and output of the forced labor camps especially insofar as the development and construction of public works and infrastructure were concerned    natalya reshetovskaya aleksandr solzhenitsyns first wife wrote in her memoirs that the gulag archipelago was based on campfire folklore as opposed to objective facts she wrote that she was perplexed that the western media had accepted the gulag archipelago as the solemn ultimate truth saying that its significance had been overestimated and wrongly appraised she said that her husband did not regard the work as historical research or scientific research and added that the gulag archipelago was a collection of camp folklore containing raw material which her husband was planning to use in his future productions15 a controversial work authored by a historian suspected of working with british intelligence claims that her memoirs were part of a kgb campaign orchestrated by yuri andropov in 1974 to discredit solzhenitsyn16 historian and archival researcher stephen g wheatcroft asserts that it is essentially a literary and political work and never claimed to place the camps in a historical or socialscientific quantitative perspective17
  also a fun fact  if you go on any communist reddit god forbid and ask about / search for threads about the book they will mindlessly parrot the fact that solzhenitsyns wife said it was a work of fiction and refuse to engage with it on any level  good enough proof for me that it contains enough truth to threaten their fragile simple minded and underdeveloped systems thinking
  i rly like this book and ive had good discussion of it on this board
  then read 200 years together    its translated in french so thats probably the best option
   documented the soviet governments reliance on the prison system for governance and labor placing doubt on the entire moral standing of the soviet system the government could not govern without the threat of imprisonment the soviet economy depended on the productivity and output of the forced labor camps especially insofar as the development and construction of public works and infrastructure were concerned  this sounds like bullshit given the length and scale of the ussr and the fairly minute camps nonexistent for most of its history too relative to the hugeness also what nonsense is reliance on this threat of imprisonment you could say the same shit about any society and there were obviously people who wholeheartedly believed in its dream and worked towards it otherwise it wouldve collapsed very quickly i dont see how it was reliant on it more than any other nationstate ever isolated cases notwithstanding
i read the first half of the first volume but really didnt have much of an interest to go on it just started getting repetitive but i have skimmed parts of the rest and the other two volumes just reading through the index trying to find his hot takes on other soviet figures the most insane thing ive come across is the dekulakization deathtoll figure he seemingly pulls out of nowhere i havent ever seen other estimates come anywhere close to this high  this chapter will deal with a small matter fifteen million souls fifteen million lives   first lines to part vi ch 2 in vol iii pg 350
just read one day in the life of ivan denisovich and then extrapolate
  its worth noting that solzhenitsyn was already fucking his future wife when natalya said that either way if you believe what his wife said theres a good chance youre believing 40 year old propaganda which is kinda funny      ok op its mostly the statistics basically solzhenitsyn admits that hes working with breadcrumbs when it comes to the numbers when the soviet archive was opened in the 90s figures were far lower than what as had predicted however there are lingering questions about the accuracy of the official numbers but unfortunately the archive has been closed since putin came to power    also much of the book is made up of others stories in the full version solzhenitsyn often mentions what may or may not be rumour however in the abridged version this isnt the case and can lead to confusion    also dont listen to the plebs here its a difficult occasionally tedious and very fucking long but its one of the best books youll ever read if you can get through it
  not going to read lobster mans 1500 page monstrosity but what about pic related im highly sympathetic to petersons views towards the soviet union and ive read a bit about the terrors of communist totalitarianism various books on the ussr moaist china north korea cambodia under pol pot etc ive also read applebaums the crushing of eastern europe despite being a dirty kike applebaum is obviously an expert on the subject also ive read that the gulag archipelago may not be the most accurate source
  forgot pic
  read this
all of it happened but there was nothing wrong with it because 99 of those sent to gulag were evil jews
  its a difficult occasionally tedious  i had a very different experience it was a fun light read i dont remember ever getting bored or tired from reading the book there are a lot of names and shorthands mentioned but generally you can just extrapolate what they are by the context and by the 3rd book youll have them memorized on the other hand i didnt read the book in english and the translation to estonian seems helluva lot better than to english so your mileage may wary if your language has close ties to russian you ought to consider reading it in that language    the book is read best as a confessional i think asking the question did this really happen this way exactly is a pretty shitty approach to this clearly ss generation was wronged in ways and i personally have family members affected in the 50s purge waves its certainly not all made up
what are some books the feature a protagonist who voluntarily works long hours for absolutely no monetary compensation

great use of the emily dash  lots of her poetry is as much about what is left unsaid in these spaces as what us said
  is she spiritualized sadomasichism like anima from ffx

you have to read more than one faulkner to start appreciating him i think that aild and its portrait of a poor white family is supposed to contrast with tsatf and its portrait of southern aristocracy
hows that novel coming along /lit/
stuck on the second act of my second rewrite  its been a long time since i enjoyed working on ti
i actually needed to take a break because a new idea popped into my head and i cant stop thinking about it can i get some feedback please its an idea for a screenplay that i think may actually kill    plot would be about a single dad from new jersey who has sole custody of his terminally ill 10 year old daughter the mother is out of the picture because she moved back to arizona to live with her parents and undergo rehab dad struggles at home to make ends meet but hes wholly good despite being a disappointment to himself his daughter looks up to him and therefore has learned to be independent in order to support her dad as much as she can     the daughter can also sing really well and idolizes a certain fictional female singer who is a panel judge on a nationally broadcast talent show daughter finally gets x months left to live dad decides to drop everything and drive her to california to audition on the talent show and sing her favorite song on national television before she dies along the way they stop at certain landmarks and bond even more dad struggles with funds but doesnt let his daughter know during a detour the daughter convinces the dad to do something hes reluctant to do out of fear of embarrassment daughter is getting noticeably sicker     after a mishap dad finally runs too low on cash but planned ahead they stop at her grandparents house in arizona and are warmly welcome dad and grandpa cover the money situation daughter wants to see mom who is still in rehab they all go as a family and the daughter and mother interact dad and mom interact on their way into california daughter falls asleep in the car ride while dad tells her the story about how he and her mom met daughter dies cope grief mourn scene in the car 2 weeks dad appears on the talent show and explains why hes there he tells the female judge that his daughter looked up to her and he was going to be singing one of her songs dad sings the song as well as he can through teary eyes the crowd cheers when the hooks hit and erupts when its over end    super super basic rough idea honestly i feel like its a money grabbing opportunity that would resonate with a lot of people best case scenario some current pop star writes a song for it and then is the judge but i really think if done properly this could happen thoughts im a faggot i know
  im a faggot i know  yup just about sums up any responses youre going to get from these folks btw youre a faggot
    started my first chapter yesterday and i want to scrap it    the idea is there but im simply not happy with my first draft unhappy enough to figure that i may not be cut out for writing    im not necessarily trying to come of as a pseude or pretentious in my work  that would be counterproductive as those tones may put off lighter readers the larger market and make me look tryhard i do not want a masterpiece just something that can entertain the reader and maybe maybe make them keep an eye out for my name on future books     it wasnt even supposed to be a novel rather a short story  however the intro turned into chapter and it is seemingly evolving from there     i cant make up my mind between scrapping or redrafting that initial draft of chapter 1 or conversely going with the flow of thoughts and moving on the chapter 2 do an entire rough draft of the novel because even beginning to rewrite or form any improvements     write now pun intended i feel as though i am not smart enough to write well perhaps you can tell from the grammar my post if thats the case of not in which case please note this post is a first draft with zero proof reading or editing from start to actual posting
  short stories  novels
i dont get it why does a grown man write a story about a cute little girl
  should children write books for other children   anyways carroll was a pedo but at least he refrained
  should children write books for other children  no i mean what causes a man to want to do that in the first place for a little girl but i guess you answered my question in your second sentence do you think he was using his writing as an outlet for his urges like how some fetish artists use their drawings
  because only newfags think moe is about wanting to fuck little girls
  gender dysphoria
some people actually like children
  this nothing wrong with that
  everyone wants to be a little girl desu
  well he was a photographer he had plenty of occasions to take pictures of prepubescent girls and parents didnt quite care because children werent seen as somenthing sexual inj the first place  he often wrote about his struggle to resist temptations and alice in wonderland may have helped him cope with it  it wasnt a sexual kind of love from my point of view he probably just idolized the purity of young girls but to what extent i dare not say
  to get close to their moms he was into milfs
  this is more l frank baum than carroll imo
    do you think he was using his writing as an outlet for his urges    though caroll being a pedo or not is subject of controversy the poem that opens through the lookingglass always sounded extremely bizarre and creepy if you read it under that lens    child of the pure unclouded brow  and dreaming eyes of wonder  though time be fleet and i and thou  are half a life asunder  thy loving smile will surely hail  the lovegift of a fairytale    i have not seen thy sunny face  nor heard thy silver laughter  no thought of me shall find a place  in thy young lifes hereafter   enough that now thou wilt not fail  to listen to my fairytale    a tale begun in other days  when summer suns were glowing  a simple chime that served to time  the rhythm of our rowing  whose echoes live in memory yet  though envious years would say forget    come hearken ere voice of dread  with bitter tidings laden  shall summon to unwelcome bed  a melancholy maiden  we are but older children dear  who fret to find our bedtime near    without the frost the blinding snow  the stormwinds moody madness  within the firelights ruddy glow  and childhoods nest of gladness  the magic words shall hold the fast  thou shalt not heed the raving blast  and though the shadow of a sigh  may tremble through the story  forhappy summer glory  it shall not touch with breath of bale  the pleasance of our fairytale
  because its actually a scientific thesis    that and theres no rule that one gender and age group cant write from the perspective of the opposite group
  he often wrote about his struggle to resist temptations  sauce
  there are many many interpretations as to what was meant by it such a fantastic book that we still cant penetrate it 150 years after its writing
  i invented that part im afraid  sorry i got a problem with lying
  i dont know but i found little alice so charming i also liked the recent movies with the grown up alice you should watch them op
dude read the anime edition haha she is literally a loli
  i really felt like this was the case too hell i felt like i read it and watched the movies because of that
  i prefer the other grown up alice
  little girls make great protagonists
  ur qute
  something about that ribbon cute i think i need to revisit alices adventures in wonderland 3
  transgender 57y old father of seven leaves his family to live as a little girl
  i wish i was a little girl
because he hates logical positivists and the death penalty
  i have this it has cute anime illustrations inside on almost every page    someone should do this for lolita 
  how do you know shes cute  maybe the assumption that alice is cute says something about your urges too
  how do you know shes cute  the author approved illustrations
  platonic relationships with young people can be great but since there are so many predators are unworkable

what are the best books about knights that arent total genre fiction/fantasy
  bump for interests some chivalric novels sound fun
  don quixote  the fairy queene
the talisman is a great romp of a knight and a saracen traveling together lots of that poor heathen couldnt enjoy wine or pork lmao
bump
the knight in history by frances gies its nonfiction but still very engaging if you are interested in some history of knighthood
that biography about william marshall is pretty good
  song of roland  parzival   the works of chrétien de troyes  nibelungenlied  cantar de mio cid  sir gawain and the green knight  orlando innamorato and its sequel orlando furioso   jerusalem delivered  ivanhoe  chivalry or la chevalerie by léon gautier    there are from the top of my head but you should discover more knight books and the history of the the genre if you read gautiers book from what ive read so far he does a fascinating analysis on the differences between chivalric romance and the older masculine/warriorlike and more authentic chanson de geste
  don quijote is good and funny  id also recommend cantar del mio cid he is a very popular knight here in spain
  no such men existed you probably mean guillaume le maréchal
anyone want to help me understand kant and duty
fucking go do some reading yourself and stop being lazy dont want to read kant nobody does and so nobody does try an oxford very short introduction instead its better than wikipedia or whatever shit youre about to read in this thread    inb4 that guy who read a kant pdf for his university class obnoxiously says omg lol you plebe ive read kant    i would wager that less than 5 people who have read the critique in full have ever even heard of /lit/
  anyone want to help me understand kant and duty  wanting to help someone  you came to the wrong planet pard
  kants a cunt
  everyones an idiot who hasnt read x because im an idiot who hasnt read x
  that dude should get a face tatoo and drop a mixtape on soundcloud
  ive read kant the critique of pure and practical reason cover to cover and parts of prolegomena to any future metaphysicians because i wanted to     i dont think kant is as difficult hes a bad writer but his prose doesnt seem like it is purposely confusing unlike hegel     fire away op
objectivism is the one true philosophy prove me wrong     pro tip you cant
never read ayn rand but would describing objectivism as egoism  capitalism be accurate
  i would disagree individualism is not egocentric it can be but by definition its simply being against collectivism and valuing yourself before others alturism falls out of the equation as well    full heartedly agree with the capitalism
  the /lit/ randanon here completely wrong objectivism fully subsumes egoism rather than a stirnerite or nietzschean egoism rand formulated and extolled an actually noncontradictory egoism which is subortinated to reason and the laws of causality  identity stirner for instance would object to this trying to argue that egoism should have primacy and any attempt to adulterate it is to assault the individual as a concept rand recognized this as a fallacy and in fact not subortinating egoism to reason and other things on which it logically depends is to introduce a corrupting element to it it is because of the nature of objectivity and operants of reason that egoism can exist at all and be validated  also your use of egocentric is dropping a bit of contextuality the rectitude of having the ego as ones centralizing focus is dependant on whether or not a given egos excellence of development warrants this centralizing by a given man that of course differs   between men  a far better answer to  is to provide this quote of rands  i am not primarily an advocate of capitalism but of egoism and i am not primarily an advocate of egoism but of reason if one recognizes the supremacy of reason and applies it consistently all the rest follows  this the supremacy of reason was is and will be the primary concern of my work and the essence of objectivism
  youre not wrong but fuck off with this low quality /pol/ tier post redditfags do shit like this to softfalseflag
  this picture implies that you can choose to live a different way if you hate capitalism whats the alternative other than moving out of the first world buy a farm and make your own clothing out of wool you can live in a captive society and hate it without being a hypocrite if the alternative is crushing poverty or living in the woods like fucking sasquatch or do you think that you can hold a job in this day and age without a phone
  isought  rand doesnt even bother  ayn do you even hume
  t steamed relativist
   rand recognized this as a fallacy   what is the fallacy    and in fact not subortinating egoism to reason and other things on which it logically depends is to introduce a corrupting element to it   why is it corrupting    it is because of the nature of objectivity and operants of reason that egoism can exist at all and be validated  so youve provided a claim wheres the support    there is no argument here its just a wordy endorsement of a stupid philosophy
bump
  shut up faggot youre just trying not to feel bad the real implication here isnt simply that theres no other choice than to live under capitalism but that the most vocal opponents of it are also the largest consumers and supporters of capitalism this girls dad probably wears the same pair of new balance shoes till they wear out and thats the hypocrisy fuck these whores
  there will never be an argument objectivism is nothing more than secular talmudry
  what is the fallacy  the stolen concept fallacy    why is it corrupting  it is to commit the error of whim worship having strong feelings about ones ego is not sufficient mans mind is his basic means of survival and of selfprotection reason is the most selfish human faculty it has to be used in and by a mans own mind and its product truth makes him in effect inflexible intransigent impervious to the power of any pack or any ruler deprived of the ability to reason man becomes a docile pliant impotent chunk of clay to be shaped into any subhuman form and used for any purpose by anyone who wants to bother there has never been a philosophy a theory or a doctrine that attacked or limited reason which did not also preach submission to the power of some authority philosophically most men do not understand the issue to this day but psychoepistemologically they have sensed it since prehistoric times observe the nature of mankinds earliest legends such as the fall of lucifer the lightbearer for the sin of defying authority or the story of prometheus who taught men the practical arts of survival powerseekers have always known that if men are to be made submissive the obstacle is not their feelings their wishes or their instincts but their minds if men are to be ruled then the enemy is reason to live man must hold three things as the supreme and ruling values of his life reason purpose selfesteem reason as his only tool of knowledge purpose as his choice of the happiness which that tool must proceed to achieve selfesteem as his inviolate certainty that his mind is competent to think and his person is worthy of happiness which means is worthy of living  so youve provided a claim wheres the support  the kind of nietzschean/stirnerite egoists in fact are a product of the altruist morality and represent the other side of the altruist coin the men who believe that any action regardless of its nature is good if it is intended for ones own benefit just as the satisfaction of the irrational desires of others is not a criterion of moral value neither is the satisfaction of ones own irrational desires a similar type of error is committed by the man who declares that since man must be guided by his own independent judgment any action he chooses to take is moral if he chooses it ones own independent judgment is the means by which one must choose ones actions but it is not a moral criterion nor a moral validation only reference to a demonstrable principle can validate ones choices take a wild guess what stirner would call a demonstrable principle
  you ever think that robots go out of their way to feel bad
i appreciate objectivism in some ways but i think its link to the moral ethics it espouses are quite weak the metaphysics is uses is supposed to form the background to its moralitywhich is something missing from so much of modern philosophy but it never bridges that gap
i dislike capitalism and over materialism but i hate communists what am i
  surely there is plenty of hypocrisy among those who superficially say fuck capitalism1 on insta though when actually confronted with the prospect of relinquishing some of their shit would recant but consuming doesnt make you a hypocrite non participation isnt an option capital is global and all encompassing on all fronts even those who are hardline mls would probably admit that they themselves are interpolated by capitalism alwaysalready interpolated    the idea that simply existing within capitalist system disqualifies its dissidents from critiquing it is still dumb no ethical consumption and all that the point is to work towards trying to dismantle the systems that surround you if you refuse to attempt that however ill agree that youre a hypocrite
  cringe
  why does every ideology insist that i work why is civilization so important
  depends on what your sticking point with communists is
  well even without civilization youd have to work to survive so idk dog if you wanna stop eating and just walk the vast expanses til you drop godspeed bro
  none at all
  i pretty much do whose to say i would die the mongolians didnt have a civilization when they first arrived on the steppe they wandered off into a brutal wasteland and eventually prospered and conquered their corner of the world in fact now civilization is ubiquitous and it insists upon itself with force even
  they wandered off into a brutal wasteland  conquered their corner of the world in fact    that doesnt sound like it took some amount of effort conquering asia seems like quite a bit of work to me thats why i put work in quote
  the point is to work towards trying to dismantle the systems that surround you  thats a very dangerous and faggy idea what i you do not agree with the system surrounding you but thousands of other people are content and happy with it in that case by working to undermine said system you must also contend with admission of being  a egotistical  b morally superior to the combined morality of thousands of people  c fully educated on the unforeseen implications of your dismantling of the system
  the conquest part was actually a step down some assholes had taken advantage of their prosperity or whatever they had gotten too large at that point i guessbut they survived well enough before civilization arrived
  question are more people content or discontent in their lives under capitalism
  i would say content
  thousands of other people are content and happy with it  capitalism subjects billions to terrible conditions  a any endeavor is egotistical by that metric things i want will inevitably require things to happen that others dont want  b morally superior to the combined morality of thousands of people  i mean maybe thats a pretty broad statement im sure there are at least 2000 people with worse morals than me so yeah  c i dont think capitalists see the future with pristine clarity either so kind of a moot point
  well hard mode include the developing world yes im tapping away on an iphone that was made in a factory that had to install suicide nets im content i did try to off myself a week ago but im content
  youre thinking only of the hubs of capital consider the regions from which capital comes from
  falling into c    falling into b

hiro lets us have one meta thread so /lit/ meta thread    what are everyones thoughts on the post 4channel /lit/ has anything changed at all is is true that fuck niggers and fuck janitors
it was really fucking weird for the first several hours there was clearly some new janitor/mod going hog wild deleting threads and posts it was kind of like travelling back in time to the pseudobutterfly janitor years where if you even made a joke about misogyny or said i dont like mao you would be banned and have all your posts deleted     i made a test thread or two to see how harsh it was and it was harsh seemingly inflammatory content right wing but deliberately inoffensive and constructive in presentation deleted and banned instantly     i was figuring the website was now redditized and that was that but then it simmered back down and now it seems back to normal im not sure exactly what happened
i feel like the general thread quality has gone down a bit the moderation has changed in some ways for sure lots of borderlinerelevant interesting threads getting purged and lots of books about this feel style garbage getting left up
talking about nanowm or whatever it is should be an autoban offense because its all shit for brains crossboarders producing even more garbage and flooding the publishing industry with this trash its pure reddit and they need to go back     asspained tranny janny probably committed suicide idk famalam its almost like being a shitlib is a mental disorder  t too smart for politics mao was the best thing to ever happen to the chinese though because now we have 30 million fewer chinks i wish we had 5 successive mao zedongs to finish the chinese question for good name one good chinese book that isnt tao te ching ill wait its all dbz tier wu xia crap
  whats the new janitor pissed by 
its more boring thats for sure
  in what way is it more boring    theyre contained in their general and its very literature related desu ne
  the world doesnt need thousands of new poorly edited hunks of trash novels every year not one single book produced out of nanowrimo has been worth the kbs it takes up let alone worth reading
  doesnt matter hiro wants the site sanitized for advertisers so hell hire useful idiots who are willing to ban thoughtcrime for free anything that isnt conducive to advertising  anything nonmainstream anything offensive
  this website will lose all its traffic if they ban nog memes (((fuck jannies)))
its the same if not worse there are maybe 20 posters on the whole board who are actually interested in books everyone else is either here to post their feels or do /pol/ shitposting this board would unironically improve if it just dropped all pretenses and changed to /p9k/  pseud nine thousand    the poetry crit thread remains the only good thread even if the majority of the poems are hot garbage the nanorimo or whatever the fuck is ok too though most people are just writing genre fiction we should have a dedicated writing board itll be tiny but thats fine /po/ has basically no activity and is the best board on the site read into that what you will

  fun when i read them in middle school but the religion aspect went over my head
  disgusting and heresypilled
what are some good psychological horror books
  ramlette
  ramlette  what no books come up when searching that
in the process of writing a historical novel  read so much about the period and chronology  want to avoid stupid anachronisms   constantly have to check this and that  this is tiresome
  you actually care for the intricracies of your craft as opposed to spewing out drivel keep going
  keep it up anon by being so rigorous youre doing a great job  if its becoming into too much of an uphill battle for you i recommend you space out the editing process from the writing look out for anachronisms after finishing a chapter or so that way you wont get so burnt out by the constant verification
  all hard work is tiresome the product is worth it
  keep going anon youre putting in hard work and theres no reason to stop now
  historical novel  thats kind of vague what is the story about what kind of characters are we talking about peasants fighting for survival or scheming nobels
  this
  writing good fiction is hard    wow what a surprise
          thanks for the support i didnt expect that i just wanted to vent      its both the general idea is to have story lines with both the aristocracy and the plebs
be like op  rewrite story into scifi so i dont have to care about anything but the characters and plot    level up kid
  just do the hack thing to do and claim the anachronisms are intentional then leave readers to inference why
  this is a bretty good representation of the average scifi writer
dont give up pal the research is half the fun after all no different from hard scifi authors doing their thing
  
  the last bit is surprisingly useful regarding establishing character and place in shorts btw

i was just about to make this same thread hahaha
could of  should of  would of  fuck
i need help finding an illustrated book i read as a kid it was some crazy psychedelic shit where like there was all this hidden shit in the illustrations but generally i think it revolved around time like it involved a bunch of animals or some shit going to this massive party at some tudorinspired house and like i said every page was full page illustrations filled with all kinds of crazy shit thus author had a very unique style and did a couple of books from what i recall they usually involved hidden puzzles that were numeric related jesus christ i cant remember now but im sure one of you guys knows
dont think it was chris van allsburg btw
not david wiesner either i dont think
not james gurney either
im assuming you zoomers have never read a book before in your lives so heres some sick david wiesner to help at least
write whats on your mind /lit/    i hope to god this works for me im begging you lord make this work for me give me a chance
  theres already a thread for that
which is the best english translation of kafkas metamorphosis
  the cliff notes
  the one by me
im loyle to my capo
  just go with the muir translation thats what i did their translation was the standard for several decades and is still well regarded
  he does look like chrissy boy
  watch it kaffy
  for kafka in english only buy editions published by schoecken
  i second this i find other translations fail to honestly capture the dreamlike whimsical tone of his writings quite like the muirs did
  that doesnt help op very much since schocken have put out numerous translations of kafka over the decades
  what  said go with either whatever schocken have recently put out or the old muir translations muir is the way to go with you want to see what wowed english speaking audiences in the 20th century
  ive read his works in the john williams translation is that considered a bad translation bad enough to warrant buying the muir or schocken translation
  nah johns translation is fine not bad at all you dont need to buy the other translations but my advice would be if you reread kafka check out the muir translation then you can compare it to johns and see which you prefer
i read hoffmanns and remember liking his introduction where he went into some of the idiosyncrasies of kafka in german iirc  is it thought to be a bad one
neugrochel is the way to go  surprised to see him not mentioned here already
friendly reminder that kafka jerked off to gay bestiality porn
  so did your mother
the bernofsky one isnt bad and it comes with an introduction by cronenburg    she also explains the particular words she translated and why which i think is great if you want to understand the process
i am reading the trial and it reads like a bad dream not a full nightmare tho how do you write like that
  i didnt find it phenomenal as the popular opinion suggested but more i live after reading this book i find myself in situations thoughts which really reflect the kafkaesque whether its faith success or the very search of meaning the absurd zig zag of ks predicament and its tragic yet suggestive of a far away being who cared about ks fate is an imagery dear to my heart
learn german faggot apart from memeing it really is significantly better
just learn german my dude
  no shit its better but you cant spend years learning a new language just to read a book  not to mention how long it takes to become acquainted enough with the subtleties of the language to appreciate the prose   kafka is still great in english
   you cant spend years learning a new language just to read a book    many respected individuals did just that it really depends on what to read a book means to you though    or perhaps you foresee a better future for yourself
  who learned a language just to read a book and not for other reasons too like a general interest in that countries literature  im practical there are at least 5 languages that i dont know but would love to i have many diverse interests aside from literature which is a hobby to me as a stem student i simply dont have the time to do everything i want to im even learning french well building on what i know from school as a hobby because of my interest in french literature and itll be at least a year before im good enough to read what i want to    so im gonna read all the kafka in english i want to because while it may be ideal to read it in german practically speaking its never going to happen as i have many other things to do and i get plenty out of it in english anyway
piggybacking the metamorphosis was alright but why is the trial such a pack of hot garbage mc acts schizophrenic only thing i can think hes saying is that mc is such an insufferable egoistic prick that he digs his own grave by making the impression hes guilty of something just from how autistic he acts still better than 1984 though
  mc  back to 
  spoilers the trial is not about a trial
  not to mention how long it takes to become acquainted enough with the subtleties of the language to appreciate the prose    i read it with roughly b1 german and still could appreciate the prose his prose is actually pretty straightforward    kafka is still great in english  nope
  it was literally autism
    tbrainlet    just learn the language or stick to vidya you retards
i read something in a scholarly work about this subject ie the translation of kafka and the conclusion it came to was that while recent translations may be more technically accurate the old muir translations more faithfully capture the sense of the german opinions vary of course so that isnt an absolute judgment im looking for a link to it and will post it if i can find it
  also i find that this situation is often the case regarding standard translations eg pevear and garnett for dostoevsky
  everything is literally autism
  only reading what you can read in its original language  why would you ever want to limit yourself this way at least half my favourite literature i read in translation obviously not the half where im most concerned with quality of the prose my very favourite novels ever range across 6 different languages  cant imagine approaching literature like you do    nope  youre more likely to miss the subtleties of the text with a weak understanding of the language than you are reading a good or even acceptable translation   im bilingual myself was taught to speak in two languages but my understanding of my other language while fit for conversation is still nothing compared my understanding of english when it comes to being able to appreciate prose

  dont listen to this cretin if the self you are is in disharmony with the world around you become a better self your anxieties and insecurities are your bodys alarm bells signalling that youre doing something wrong dont shut off the alarm and keep on speeding down an unhealthy path inertia is a property of the human spirit changing directions will take massive effort and massive action on your part but though your life will never be perfect if you already have the intellectual capacity and curiosity to have sought out and stayed on a board like this you have the raw materials required to do something with your life so do it     block the internet on your computer and phone reset your sleep schedule decide what one or two things you really want out of the next few years maybe you want to write that novel maybe you want a girlfriend maybe you want to own your own place decide where your major priorities lie and then plan your weeks in accordance with these priorities meal prep on sundays/monday nights so food is taken care of start working out if you think it will help you achieve your goals as it really does act as a natural antidepressant and makes you feel capable and powerful if you want to write sign up for a onceweekly writing class or group the deadlines and sense of competition between you and your fellow writers will motivate you to fill out those hours youve scheduled for writing etc etc    dont numb your true self out of existence you are in the larval stage a stage in which many of not most people stay and the stage you will likely be confined to if you mute all the signals your body and soul are sending you with ssris i believe in you believe in yourself put your damn head down and grind it out

  very inspiring but if i dont take the medicines i straight up kill myself these braindestroying pills are keeping me alive
  i understand that there are people for whom they are something of a necessity however i still think that even such people should take the minimum amount necessary to rouse them from their paralysis and dampen the outright suicidiality and use the rest of their brute anxious energies to fuel their material intellectual and bodily self improvement
  jesus op youre a fucking genius
  about a third of all people suffering from severe depression wont get better with treatment its called treatmentresistant depression and it really sucks the medicines barely work if they do work at all im pretty sure that the only reason im holding onto my treatment is because ive become dependent on the meds so if i try to get off them i experience horrible side effects i can barely drift from day to day hoping that something will eventually get better im going to end up in a psych ward probably
  this is good advice anon thank you

  back in your box  good piggie  wagey
imagine a society that subjects people to conditions that make them terribly unhappy then gives them the drugs to take away their unhappiness instead of removing the conditions that make people depressed modern society gives them antidepressant drugs in effect antidepressants are a means of modifying an individuals internal state in such a way as to enable him to tolerate social conditions that he would otherwise find intolerable

        why are major depression and anxiety spreading like plagues through modernity although they likely existed in the past as isolated incidents there is nothing even remotely like an historical precedent for the percentages of people afflicted by them today our fundamental biology hasnt changed so what has our environments and our orientations towards them     the way modern people are interacting with their environments are wreaking havoc on their neurobiological balances this has to do with things like the ubiquity of technology in our lives and the real stresses they create on our minds and bodies the chaos in which we are immersed and the zeitgeist of our time which has made certain disabling interpretations of life and our place in the world seem logical and natural in the same way stereotyping s group of people will make people live up to those stereotypes so too does our current zeitgeist essentially provide interpretations of the way things are that actually end up creating the very phenomena they sought to diagnose the fatalistic interpretation of mental health in terms of genetics and hemical imbalances is one such interpretation of course it has some truth to it but it also locks people into an interpretive schema that is hugely disempowering after all if youre just an inherited assortment brain chemicals and you inherited an anxious and depressive assortment what can you do but take medications    im not denying that there actually are treatment resistant chemical imbalances and that some people will need medication regardless of what they do however i also think modernity has plunged us so deep into the water that we cannot even see the sunlight and so people talking about its existence sound naive as if they were talking about a myth and then one decides fuck it maybe theyre right and tries swimming up to the surface with as much energy and intensity they can muster only to find themselves still submerged in the cold and directionless dark still without any glimpse of the socalled sun this is where a lot of people are and the idea that things could be otherwise seems to have been disproved by their own efforts however this doesnt mean that the sun doesnt shine above the surface it just means that we are so far down so deeply submerged in the material cultural and spiritual conditions of modernity that we would need to make a massive and consistent effort over a long period of time to get to the surface for most people if they found a healthy orientation towards life and really committed to it they would gradually get farther away from their depression and anxiety the problem is that doing so is painful and moreover there is a huge industry whose profitability depends on you believing that doing so is impossible
  as long as im fine with religion and booze i am fine with that imagine all those depressed people trying to make actual political changes to alleviate their symptoms i hate the thought of people getting involved with politics that really just want to be a protesting attention seeker victim whoring themselves for a moment of losing themselves in the fiction im glad we get to keep people this way i just wish we didnt have to lie to them about be free and living in a free country it must be a jarring experience
  white noise tier bait
  decide what one or two things you really want out of the next few years
depression is literally convincing yourself feeling like shit is the right thing to do  just stop reinforcing or kill yourself
  you arent some static essence worthy of love you are your beingatwork you are what you do so start doing things that reflect the person you want to be and then you will be able to love yourself
  a subsistence farmer in the middle ages probably had a pretty bad life i consider depression not a product of modernity but the human condition medicalized by the profit seeking pharmaceutical industry
  i feel like i could live this way if there was at least say briefly meeting up with friends once a fortnight how can you actually be so alone without going mad
  if you believe what you wrote in the first 3/4 of this post you cant possibly go back to  just try harder bro  with a straight face   there is no way of escaping modernity or the modern psychological environment to any significant degree except by literally just fucking off to live with some huntergatherer tribe somewhere you are stuck here  how retarded do you have to be to think that modern society is fundamentally broken to the point where its causing mass depression but also think that finding a healthy orientation towards life and committing to it is a line that makes any sense at all

how do i write a smart character without that character seeming like a psued thats trying to be smart
step 1 be smart
  you cant all smart people are pseuds
  this too kind of rusts smartness was part hubris ill remind you of the ending and how rust the taxman changed over the course of the story
  maybe i missworded it how do i create a deep and complex character without it seeming like rust is what feels like a pseud writer that just read a bit of philosophy and is trying to be smart what makes it such an obvious giveaway
  be smarter than your character
  bro im an optimist now cause stars in the sky
  this opinion is unironically based as fuck
  based and flowers for algernonpilled
  dont be a dummy rust started the series as a godhating nihilistic ligotti fag by the end he had seen real evil and a hand in conquering it and consequently gained hope for his own future      what makes it such an obvious giveaway  simple regurgitation of a philosophers ideas rust is guilty of this for expositions sake especially with no connection to the characters own actions or thoughts as if he doesnt understand the ideas in the first place rust is not guilty of this
  let the plot unravel in a way where the reader doesnt know what the character is planning/doing until the plot finally twists  the character has to outsmart the reader to make the character seem smart
  especially with no connection to the characters own actions or thoughts as if he doesnt understand the ideas in the first place rust is not guilty of this  how
  /thread
  how what
  you cant write a character smarter than yourself you can write one quicker than yourself that is a character that can come to a conclusion in a short amount of time that would take you longer just think more about it
  how was rust not guilty of that
  smart isnt a character trait
  was he considered a pseud in the book edmond always had the upper hand in conversations and made the person he was talking to seem like a child
  rust sincerely believed in what he preached his words are honest expressions of his sincere thoughts so are his actions he retreated from his own life to the greatest degree possible without actually ending it this indicates he understood whichever philosophers he had read or his author had read lamebrain ligotti in this case    a poorly written character will lay out simplistic definitions of their beliefs but the author being a brainlet will not know how to write them into his personality how they shape the characters views and actions the character will more closely resemble merely an aspect of the authors own voice as opposed to a being its own person dont do that
  dumas was brilliant the other anon saying smart people are pseuds was only uncovering part of the truth every character has an arc wherein they undergo a change perfect characters are boring a wellwritten smart character will inevitably be revealed to be notsosmart or in 4chan parlance a pseud
what is wrong with ligotti i was about to buy his book
by the gods plato youre a genius
  no but if anybody else tried to rewrite monte cristo he would
here is an example of what im talking about  even if you know nothing about the show or the author you can 100 feel that its not a genuine character and just a self insert  
  nothing is wrong with ligotti if you want to despair the rest of your life for no good reason hes an antinatalist brainlet who overindulges his own sadness acceptable behavior for a crap writer but not for anyone who wants to strive with life and succeed he is a 65 year old completely sincere frogposter
  youre going to have to work on your writing op in this thread youve written mostly in sentence fragments that leave the reader frustrated and asking for clarification    what the fuck are you talking about explain it with words not a youtube video
  i think the example speaks for itself the character doesnt feel like a real person it feels like a self insert
  i cant tell from that clip alone whether the character is credible id have to see him in other interactions just from this footage though i can tell you the author is guilty of that overexposition i mentioned earlier rust was guilty of that in his car talks with marty this is a demand placed by the limitations of the format    we arent limited by /tv/ though this is the literature board

  dont be a dummy rust started the series as a godhating nihilistic ligotti fag by the end he had seen real evil and a hand in conquering it and consequently gained hope for his own future  i love that people discussing the finale of td purposefully ignore that its a series of television and as such a very commercial product i can bet my left testicle that the more hopeful ending isnt there because its thematically consistent with the rest of the writing but because pizzolato and some producers didnt want to kill the series after the first season with a very sour finale
    i dont know for sure but definitely dont make them a super genius wizard who just happens to know everything because hes super cool and a genius
  you cant write a character smarter than yourself  this which is why ill never write anything worthwhile
  depends what you mean by smart the rest of this thread derailed with the interpretation that you mean quoting famous philosophers and not sounding like a cunt this is different from writing characters who are intelligent educated and quickthinking    anyway just give your character a southern drawl nobody expects a hick to be a smartypants      dont do this
  nobody expects a hick to be a smartpants        thats why i love the fuckin engineer
  i can bet my left testicle that the more hopeful ending isnt there because its thematically consistent with the rest of the writing but because pizzolato and some producers didnt want to kill the series after the first season with a very sour finale  deathoftheauthorjpg
/lit/ talks about this show a lot is it good or do they just secretly want to be the main character
  its good not mind blowing but overall good  rust is a fucking edgelord tho had to grit my teeth going through the first 3 episodes until i got used to it
  both
  both
  first season is amazing  second season meh  third season will star mahershala ali    give the harrelson and mcconaughenlooey season a try
  antinatalist  thank you for reminding me of that post makes me laugh every time
  one is fun the other is not
  step 0 define smart
  heh conservative and grounded to reality because thats real smart people are tip
  turn to homer and take a look at odysseus and based nestor
have him be savvy instead
  show dont tell    you do not describe him doing smart things    it comes out in his interactions and dialogue with other characters
write your smart characters as trying to conceal their smartness
  ligotti is good higher concept horror  id advise starting with a couple of his short stories before reading conspiracy you get a way better sense for his quirks humor
  steer away from the skid    make him talk like a dumb sounds like a dumb and act like a dumb   working class vocabulary 80 cuss words and rough around the edges type the last man youd expect to be a bookworm     everything he says can be interpreted in a well meaning intellectual manner  but it does have to be interpreted that way   because the way in which he expresses his ideas needs some work     basically make him autism but remove the niche hobbies and interests leaving only stagnated social skills in lieu
  research and lots of it find those obscure observations or odd little facts that someone smart might recall or know about a subject remember you dont have to be as smart as your character because you dont have to create everything in one seemless go you have the advantage of being able to rework them and build on them
  exactly this    and ligotti was right a true pessimist would never change into an optimist and having a ray of sunshine wouldnt have ruined the ending i just disliked the distasteful supernatural claim of his family waiting for him
dont make him the only smart person in your story a character is only seen as smart when it is confronted with equally clever remarks if your character is the only smartass surrounded by dunlunces the best you can hope to create is a washed down calvin and hobbes
i do it ala selfinsert its the only way tough luck if you cant do this
    step 1 is actually being intelligent  step 2 is writing a character who never brags about his intelligence or does retarded anime i found you in the room because the molecules moved shit but makes quick deductions and understands concepts rapidly
  end was a massive cope to help the normie audience sleep tighy
intelligence is just like a social construct man    were all intelligent if you remove the white academic colonialist antifeminist transphobic blackphobic femmephobic patriarchy
  have him say and do smart things as decided in a recent thread will hunting is the opposite of what you should shoot for
make my character smart /lit/  write the character as silent existentialist and depressed thats what /lit/ is and its filled with geniuses
  filled with geniuses  do you actually believe that
  im shitposting the depressed existential genius is cliche although if someone wrote a peaceful intelligent character that would be interesting
  i know you were shitposting anon im honestly asking though do you think /lit/ is filled with generally smart people
  semiintelligent not the 120s and above they would have you think i think a couple drop by that are truly above and beyond relative to the normal population though anyone is a genius
  it was years ago maybe as late as 2010/11 when people came primarily to discuss literature now this board is nothing
  assuming youre intelligent yourself then you know what it means to be intelligent and you can just write honestly and genuinely just reflect on what you think about and the way you go about coming to decisions and the way you entertain yourself with your thoughts from there you can try to manipulate those to be more nuanced to the character you want to create smart people are usually at least somewhat pseuds as well so i dont know that you should be trying to avoid that more just aiming for realism also if you arent smart then youre shit out of luck
  make him silent and wear glasses
make him like pic related
  show them approaching things creatively  hand them a difficult situation and portray them assessing the situation and resolving it in ways the reader wouldnt have anticipated
  watches youtube once
  rust wasnt a pessimist he was just depressed because his kid died  im pretty sure the point of the ending is that he made a genuine connection with another humanmarty
  who never brags about his intelligence  he instead berates everyone elses
  this too
  perfect characters are boring  someones never watched akagi
  intelligence  speed at which you can process information    if it takes op 10 years to figure out something he can write about a character who takes 5 minutes to do it    the illusion of intelligence is still there
  rust wasnt a pessimist  rust cohle id consider myself a realist alright but in philosophical terms im whats called a pessimist  this guys is literally calling himself a pessimist in philosophical terms and referencing ligotti and metzinger wtf did you even watch the show seven times
  its probably a vitamin d deficency
  because his kid died and he couldnt deal with it
  and ligotti has a tummy ache therefore hes not a pessimist
  ligotti is just gay
  your mom is gay
  i wish she was shes dating this annoying guy  i said some very bad things to her today idk why i do this when im in a certain state i say awful things to people like the one thing i know will hurt them the most she was crying as she left and i just kept going    i did this to my ex so badly she cut herself up right in front of me a huge gash in her thigh she hadto be hospitalized years later she said she still remembers what i said to her every time she feels bad
mah boy is wicked smaht
  write an idiot
  explain hamlet theres no one as smart as him in the play but the play is still amazing
  really makes you think
  perfect characters only work in certain genres like selfinsert where the appeal is imaging being this awesome guy
  read these desu      
  tumblr
  yeah exactly
easy solution purposely write in pseudo intellectuals into your story have them discuss various philosophical concepts and carry on long and meaningless conversations that become more and more ridiculous as the chapters progress make what would be considered plot background noise a sort of mystery to the reader make them anticipate something big in the final pages and just abruptly end it mid contrived conversation
  subtlety
  this   you have all the time to come up with your characters plans and decisions the character does not  you can use this  i know some of you faggots are going to say  anime  but in death note theres the moment where yagami light has to figure out a persons name in literal seconds and succeeds it was done very well and they did a good job of making it very impressive even shocking but the reality is the author themself had all the time in the world to write that idea out when light did not  if done right you can even make things up provided its believable enough and you dont overuse it things like winning awards inviting suchandsuch solving suchandsuch these would all be things people told to your character or objectively true about your character not things hes just making up
  this is possible but not necessary
  basically
  basically take yourself and write the exact opposite character
  a dumb character can describe a concept  a pseud can explain it  a smart character can analyze it use it effectively and synthesize new ideas from it prefferably using a lexicon his audience can relate to  so   
  god i fucking hate yudowski so much he is such a fucking pseud
  there are always exceptions to the rule but this might actually be true
forgive me but are there any living writers left worthy of being included in the literary canon of the alltime greatest authors    is superb literature a thing of the past or am i just unaware of the few pearls lost in an ocean of shit
  yes me
  i see
  it takes time for things to be added to the canon you see it full of novels that are 50 years old because those novels have had 50 years for people to ponder whether theyre truly worth remembering  its almost impossible that say with accuracy whether a recent work will become a classic
is superb literature a thing of the past  probably
animemodern lit

witness the forces of accelerationism morph my city into something unrecognisable within 5 years  realise my petty dreams and philosophical worldview is rendered nullified and moot in the 21st century   anyone who says anything quickly becomes a novelty and old news  nothing interesting can be said anymore because the nature of the system is to keep destroying and recreating itself perpetual evolution    the only option for anyone living in the modern world is to either commit suicide or live out their days in some corporate tech job making things more efficient for the system at large it will reward you with normie activities and the like in return for your slavery
  nothing interesting can be said anymore because the nature of the system is to keep destroying and recreating itself perpetual evolution  you would have been the shittiest hegel

somebody get girardfag on the phone
  i prefer being unemployed and collecting benefits while practicing writing to fulfil my aspirations of being an author who critiques the modern system but suicide might be a quicker option
or you can move out to the country and steal real estate signs while painting free life on billboards living in dispare and perpetual fear of your home being leveled and grated the only relief from the crushing sadness and impotent rage being withdraw into excapism and the occasional love untainted by premptive grief for the precious little life left in this living world it hurts but at least you are alive
get dosh  buy land  move innawoods
    moving to the country is the biggest cuck act     also the majority of people who claim to love nature and wish to move to the country live in cities and cant bear to admit that they secretly enjoy the city life they so adamantly claim to oppose

  i shitposted about this for two months straight and i am still just as confused as you guys
  become an electrical lineman  learn forestry and move to washington so you can tarzan through the forsts all day  study medicine and practice in poor countries  devote yourself in off time to the study of an obscure language while you work your normie job   hike the pct  learn woodworking  join the mormons  backpack europe  join the trappists  become a homesteader  hitchhike across canada drifting from town to town with a guitar and writing love poems like a troubador  become a cop       theres quite a few more options dont be foolish

how do i resist offing myself and how do i collect unemployment while i work on my writing

  how the fuck can the digits of pi be a human construct and nonreal when humans cant even comprehend its entirety and yet still humans can discover more and more digits it must be beyond the human mind if it can consistently be discovered but not fully comprehended by humans
  unironically staying on the cringe compilation bandwagon even though it has been so heavily played and has lost any luster it may have once had  i hope you get lice
    youre both newfag subhumans and have no right to act superior to one another at all
  how the fuck can the digits of pi be a human construct  do people claim that what we find is a human construct i think they misspoke or you misheard i see the digits as something natural to be discovered how we choose to see its value and how we choose to apply it is our construct i am not a mathfag so i may not have expressed my point well but i see the distinction for myself
  act superior  nah im just sick of the overuse of the lame cringe bullshit its burnt  they need something new if they are going to critique everything the low energy burn is boring if they need to criticize then do it hard enough to make someone cry inb4 cringe and inb4 youre critiquing them too

  nonsensical
  the biggest trick the contemporary world plays on you is convincing you that you have to be a part of it the way to escape is to stop thinking if yourself as a citizen of modern society and start thinking of yourself primarily of whatever local society you inhabit find yourself a small community of people and stop thinking about the larger society it doesnt matter
which rule resonated with you the most
  rule 13 wash your penis
those range from pretty based to fucking trash the one about listening to people is good thoughas is the befriending positive people one
  i dont really feel strongly about peterson either way but 7 is pretty much the foundation of any religion or meaningful philosophy ever its something you either learn or suffer for avoiding
  this one got to scrub my spitroasted hog yup
  big whoop wanna fight about it
what are his actual 12 rules
    assume the person youre listening to knows something you dont  t jordan peterson    bwahahahahahaha
  13 bow down to kara boga
  
  people actually need to be told these things
for arguments sake  for arguments sake    these are what 12 rules i would put in my self help book they are designed to sell my book to make me seem very wise and 3rd of all to provide mass amounts of people with advice that has a net positive impact supposing they all act on it     1 allow yourself to be proven wrong   2 love yourself like you love your own family members  3 make sure your time commitments are proportional to your life commitments  4 let wisdom knowledge and life be catalysts for will power  5 recognize you will never solve the problem of you  6 understand that you can change  7 do not try to get to the bottom of everything  8 do not give up trying to learn  9 stand for something bigger than yourself  10 take joy in the unexpected directions of your life  11 editors bonus listen to yourself sing badly  12 editors bonus give them a call even if it feels awkward
  you will never solve the problem of you  bullshit
  its not the rules themselves its the reason for them when things become common sense eventually it can be unclear to some people why they should do those things in the first place so you get doofus college kids with purple hair thinking they are arbitrary and a culture forms around that the rules in petersons book are not profound but his defense is vital in this climate
  probably 2 but im not following any of these rules
6 set your house on fire before you criticize the world    honestly this was the one that finally sold me on peterson
  i kind of want to read this
  rule 9 because im sure the dullard who posted this most know what its like to be such a faggot
robert saploskis work on baboons chimp and bonobo ethology and common sense in human observation demonstrate the mere contingency and social toxity of dominance hierarchies
  very aesthetic but you couldve made each line three words without use of prepositions/articles
  can we have a board like alternative sports for the discussion of selfhelp books
  1 stand up straight with your shoulders straight  10 times jordan peterson annihilated paraplegics
  based peterson
      thats actually general rule a it supersedes all others
  love yourself  facebook tier  but the rest is good
  these are rules are absolute thrash and generic tbqh how did peterson got away with it
  why is loving yourself facebooktier its hard to do away with insecurities yes but i would argue that loving oneself results in enriching life prove me wrong
  if i can step outside of it all right now w/r/t this dude it kind of annoys me that my instinct is to be dismissive and sardonic whenever i see anything related to the guy it simple enough advice that at least three things there would be things that everyone can agree on even if at least another three seem to have been placed there just to make people roll their eyes    but i dont think im unjustified in my contempt because a lot of the peterson worship seems creepy and unhealthy to me i think its valuable to maintain the snark because its humbling to be able to look at how silly youre being at any moment could you imagine if andrew carnegie got the same fawning overreaction from young boys that peterson not only receives but actively cultivates    and thats not even bringing his weird politics into it where he bases sensible timetested advice of selfresponsibility and cultivating discipline on some crypto innerastrology that just so happens to make him really popular with nazis
lol lurman did it better 18 years ago    
5 is just such dangerous advice to give anyone
  /trash/ already exists make it the designated board
  eh
  5 sounds like it come directly from a sociopath that watched too many religious movies and now wants to have children to have control over them
  rule 14 buy my rug
  i didnt buy petersons book nor i follow his channel but i always pet cats
  has jp ever said anything about asexuals
at what point does he teach you how to calmly dismantle feminism in front of two feminists
  peterson wrote a shittier version of a robert greene book
  do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them  set your house in order before you criticise the world
  the baby in the background makes paleconservatives dicks wet because sex is only about fertility and moment with god the creator
  that gave me an erection    how dare you    reported
  getting hard to meat girl  gross
  be precise in your speech as its the one he just straight up ignores himself
  my throbbing gristle has no ethics
unironically rule 3 because ive made terrible friends before so i could have fun
    
  1 2 3 4 6 7 9 10  meaning feelgood shit you can find in oprahs bookclub selections  5 8  genuinely terrible advices  11 12  wacky jokes to give this garbage a sense of levity
  you cant just force yourself to love something you despise  earn your own love
threadly reminder peterson doesnt even really believe in god he believes in acting as if god exists which to me is the same thing and before anyone calls me christcuck i just want to say my point is this is about honesty not antifedoraposting because he certainly presents as a believer
  genuinely terrible advices  how is tell the truth or at least dont lie terrible advice
  8  terrible     wtf honesty is literally the most vital of all virtues without it everything else is meaningless
  imagine the smell
    because ethics is more complicated than hurrr neva lie if life was that simple there wouldnt be any need for philosophy and intellectual snake oil merchants like peterson wouldnt have a job
  pet a mangy birdgenociding toxo factory when you encounter one in the street
  the truth hurts but it is liberating ignorance is death
    man i just typed an awesome reply but it got fucked when i clicked a link here is the short version    your sister just got laid off her boyfriend of 4 years whom you thought was a good influence on her left her and she has started drinking again your sister thinks of herself im a mess i wasnt good enough for him and im not good enough for anyone i ruin everything i cant seem to make it in this world im too selfish and all i deserve is to be hated to destroy myself with drink i cant do anything right    but you think of your sister man the poor girl has had such bad luck shes had so much to deal with she is a wonderful person and very capable but cant seem to find a job where shes appreciated she will find someone else to be with it just didnt work out i wish she would stop drinking and feeling so down she deserves better    thats the difference self is so caught up in self that it cannot see what it truly is and there is something revealed to us in the reflection of our face in the eyes of those who love us like family who have known us for years and seen us over and over again and know us more truly than we know ourselves
  no ethics is not that simple but honesty is dont be retarded
  no ethics is not that simple but honesty is  a platitude that would make peterson proud keep at it anon and maybe some day your internet daddy would notice you
  imagine being this bitter lmao
  why is lying good
  pure reddit
  why is lying bad
  i asked first
  alright you bastard lying is good because its an much of an essential part of human experience as telling the truth the ability to distinguish value in both the reveal of truth and its concealment is the foundational rock of personal growth without lies humans are nothing but fact dispensers eternally confused and stunned by their obsession with truthtalking it is through lies i learn to distinguish friends and foes and it is by being lied to that i become wiser and more cautious a man who was never subjected to lies is similar to a man who never learned how to walk because he was carted everywhere a pampered victim   now you turn faget

  i havent read his elaboration but i feel like 5 is really bad advice that could be misconstrued to mean be an asshole to your kids like what if youre a zealous christian and your daughter comes out and says shes muslim that would make you dislike your daughter but are you instead going to try and force her to remain christian
  any western child who says shes muslim is probably retarded your point would have been more believable if you said atheist
  god thank you for saying it and while were at it no i dont like your pet at all fuck your stinky costly poop producing pet it does nothing for me i loathe it
  ok atheist then do you force your kid to go to bible school and spread the gospel when they dont even believe in god
  yes
  well then youre a shitty parent then again since youre a fundamentalist christian in the first place odds are youve got a few screws lose to begin with

  12 is the least retarded of the bunch    10  ironic coming from him
i already do that  what the fuck does this even mean it seems to imply understandings its unwilling to elaborate upon why do people fall for this obviously hes going to define what this implies  again who is the judge of this is it peterson is it my own instincts or my cultures  this is psychotic and has no appreciable meaning at all  i dont have children and i cant control what they do regardless of how neurotic or callous towards their feelings i wanted to be his daughter is a whore and he cant control this  what if the world is destroying the order in my house this is slavish christfaggot logic  there is no inherent meaning does he mean lasting sun tzu tier faggotry  no i already lied once here its more expedient get fucked  most people i speak to are barely sapient and have at most a highschool education with no vocational skills they know where they live and maybe what they ate this morning at best and if i followed them around id have a stronger understanding of their daily life than they do  being as precise as can be maybe peterson could do the same but of course that wouldnt be a meaningfully expedient way of taking advantage of stupid people  fuck skateboarding faggot weed dealing kids and their subhuman halfpunk halfnigger lifestylist concrete jungle aesthetic everytime i see them i pray for them to suffer a massive head injury  of course
  yes i love taxoplasma and rabies

what are the best works from classical antiquity dealing with exercise
stop reading  go to the gym
heres seneca on what he thinks about making mad gains    without philosophy the mind is sickly and the body too though it may be very powerful is strong only as that of a madman or a lunatic is strong 2 this then is the sort of health you should primarily cultivate the other kind of health comes second and will involve little effort if you wish to be well physically it is indeed foolish my dear lucilius and very unsuitable for a cultivated man to work hard over developing the muscles and broadening the shoulders and strengthening the lungs for although your heavy feeding produce good results and your sinews grow solid you can never be a match either in strength or in weight for a firstclass bull besides by overloading the body with food you strangle the soul and render it less active accordingly limit the flesh as much as possible and allow free play to the spirit 3 many inconveniences beset those who devote themselves to such pursuits in the first place they have their exercises at which they must work and waste their lifeforce and render it less fit to bear a strain or the severer studies second their keen edge is dulled by heavy eating besides they must take orders from slaves of the vilest stamp  men who alternate between the oilflask1 and the flagon whose day passes satisfactorily if they have got up a good perspiration and quaffed to make good what they have lost in sweat huge draughts of liquor which will sink deeper because of their fasting drinking and sweating  its the life of a dyspeptic
  if youre actually interested in the kind of exercises he supports    now there are short and simple exercises which tire the body rapidly and so save our time and time is something of which we ought to keep strict account these exercises are running brandishing weights and jumping  highjumping or broadjumping or the kind which i may call the priests dance3 or in slighting terms the clothescleaners jump4 select for practice any one of these and you will find it plain and easy 5 but whatever you do come back soon from body to mind the mind must be exercised both day and night for it is nourished by moderate labour and this form of exercise need not be hampered by cold or hot weather or even by old age

  obviously max stirner its literally his name
tfw i have a big forehead  tfw destined to be /lit/
a big forehead is key to being /lit/ but its shape can also suggest other qualities
  tell me more tell me more
  the man in the picture has a broad but clearly defined forehead its confined to the front of his skull and doesnt stray too far up his scalp or to the sides suggesting intelligence and leadership qualities are present
  what does the arabic say
  fuck jannies
  thank god i have a big forehead
from kelley ross gender stereotypes and sexual archetypes       the cover photo of the book nicely illustrates the thesis the male face above with a blue tint and the female face below with a red tint have very different expressions the male eyes are narrowed and looking away while the female eyes are wide looking straight on camera and have relatively dilated pupils  usually a sign of friendly or receptive emotions the female face thus possibly displays empathy while the male face is clearly concerned about or tracking something else the small pupils which improve focus make the male eyes seem hard also the largest area of skin in the male face is the forehead while that of the female face is the cheek the former may imply thought while the latter with the softest large area on the face invites a kiss the effect of the two images is striking even as the blue and the red cool and warm recall the blue and pink that conventionally mark male and female babies
  did you get very far    ahuh ahuh ahuh
  i used to dislike my big scandi forehead as a teen but in my 20s i realised it was pretty good    as long as i dont go bald that would hit my confidence too hard

  these faggots who claim to have read pages in a single month  either stop skimming or get a fucking job
  do you want to be able to understand every single aspect of it yes there are prerequisites most of which you wont know you need until you encounter a reference in the text do you want to get the general gist of it just read the fucking thing worst case is that maybe in the future you want to read those prereqs and reread it oh well any reasonably educated individual should know enough history and literature to make it through as is just read eternal anglid memes on /pol/ or /his/ and youll get the gist   personally i had an irishman as a psychology professor in college so i got a bonus course on irish history from there death to the englsh     on an anime fanboard  wants to ban anime posters  animeposting is the pleb filter go back to facebook cum guzzler
  the problem is my edition has a lot of notes in the end and 50 pages in im already almost on note 100 some are skippable but some are necessary for context and its not always clear which is which so i keep having to break from the text every other paragraph to check     but checking the book theres only about 270 notes in as many pages so it must cool down a bit at some point
  if you have an annotated version it should already have everything you need to know in it what are you even complaining about read your fucking footnotes   oh god how horrible you might need to read something
  post quality would improve tenfold if weeaboos stayed in their shitty containment board prove me wrong
  youre not understanding i was just saying it was annoying because it was breaking up the flow of reading i tried reading through them beforehand but i found by the time i got to the text it referred to i couldnt properly recall or went to check anyway to be sure or the note by itself didnt make sense without reading the text first   i like annotations but 2 per page on average is enough to annoy me
  ive read more books than you have this past month prove me wrong     by the time i got to the text it referred to i couldnt properly recall  im sorry it must be difficult for you
  im sorry it must be difficult for you  to be clear i only process the information with context thus cant recall unless i read at the proper point which breaks up the flow of the text i have a good memory for the information ive processed    ive read more books than you have this past month prove me wrong  light novels dont count
the only ones i completed were the ascent by ludwig hohl and a short story collection by hans henny jahnn together culminating in a total of marvelous 300 pages marking november as my weakest month this year i read a lot for uni though and about 150 pages of the magic mountain by mann
  light novels dont count  implying anyone in this thread has listed lns  thanks for plaaaaaaaaaayyying
  actually the implication was that weebs who post anime pics read light novels  its not my fault you have poor reading comprehension
the western way of war  symposium   a few of aristophanes plays  norwegian wood

  archeofuturism  metaphysics of war  the hermetic tradition  the path of cinnabar  the crisis of the modern world  storm of steel
  should have been more clear i have plenty of annotations for context on my version too many actual many are pretty basic you dont need to tell me what the count of monti cristo is its just annoying me how its breaking up the flow of the text to keep skipping to the back to make sure im not missing out on contextual information 50 pages in already on note 100   i should probably just read and only look at the annotations if im actually confused about the meaning because most of the meaning is clear from the context but i cant seem to stop compulsively checking everything
the edge of running water by william sloane  call of the wild by jack london  a more complete beast by jack donovan  great book of amber by zelazny  the other side of the mountain by bernanos    good month
  norton criticals have plenty of background texts essays criticisms and plenty more other than just annotations tho theyre really great
  ill keep them in mind for future purchases  maybe moby dick been meaning to buy that
wasnt sure whether to post this on /his/ /int/ or here but i ultimately decided it should go here    are there any books on a prussian identity/nationalism in the modern era
  unironically nietzsche
  new prussia post 13th century is a joke
  prussia defined 18511945 germany  anything on germany for that time is on prussia  pray that soon the alpine germans become the dominant again one day
  history is a joke  prussia is the punchline
  but theres parts of poland that are prussian are there no polish people who identify as prussian
  what do you want but a /pol/ rant from me  stop asking such stupid questions
  there are based lithuanians and based belorussians who identify themselves as old prussians  basically when xtians attacked most pagans died in battles or were killed later some moved to still pagan lithuania  most poles are too catholic to identify with old prussians
  why would poles identify as prussians even germans living there in the 19th century identifying as prussians is retarded as shit prussians have been long dead
  there is nothing retarded about identifying yourself with your ancestors
    are you sure this picture is related its over    the prussians youre asking about were the descendants and successors of german colonists not baltic pagans and thats a good thing its a tragic misfortune that weve been robbed of the unique heritage of the prussian state which emerged from centuries of frontier pressures to lead the german world into shortlived dominance of the european continent sorry pal prussia and the prussians are dead and will only be remembered by impotent stormweenies such as myself despite their many contributions to humanity
  it is tho
worth reading    heard they based picard off of this guy so i figured id check it out
also pls explain this book
  for people who do not like to read
  for people like me

godel already proved platonism so why are you not a platonist anon
  how do you empirically prove the existence of a separte utopic world were everything is perfect you fucking faggot platonism in some aspects is no different to a fucking religion mental diarrhea
  doesnt understand godel  also leaning on empiricism is the most clear indication that the person is a brainlet   empirical evidence is secondary to mathematical proof
  how can some numbers prove the existence of a separate world please enlight me on godel lmao
  prove it
  how do you empirically prove  there are more kinds of proof than empirical proof in fact i wouldnt call empirical proof proof at all its more like vindication  a separte utopic world  not platonism you fucking pseud
  prove what cunt     get informed about platonism please 
  it has to do with the limitations of axiomatic systems  watch these    
  you and i both know i wont watch 60 minutes of maths but for all i know godel was trying to prove the existence of god not the veracity of platos philosophy
  you and i both know i wont watch 60 minutes of maths  i honestly didnt know that desu you should watch it with a notebook and pencil and work through the proof as well its very cool
  he was right about everything  
  that proof is absolutely worth studying give it an hour of your time instead of jerking off not only did it have massive implications mathematically and otherwise its clever as fuck
  get informed about platonism please  forms are not a separate world you massive nig
  but i am anon
  that man is a pedant those videos could have been just as rigorous but a quarter of the time
i saw a poetry thread but lets get a prose thread going
  critique threads are useless    ive posted long prose sections from some of the greatest writers of the 19th21st century in critique threads just to see what happens and people still nitpick the shit out of it     literally the only way to get good is develop your own taste to an insanely immersive degree and educate yourself in grammar linguistics and composition until you can treat writing with a mathematical precision    the only opinions you should trust are from those who are demonstrably better and more knowledgeable than you professors and educators writers who you admire and even those opinions you should treat with suspicion
  a general impression i have is that you reach for the poetical expression at the expense of the ideas communication if you want to describe something niche and unusual that people will not immediately relate to like a character who used to talk with trees its best to explain the phenomenology and experience of talking with trees in whatever language will best help you communicate the idea     the style has a nice flow to it from a syntactical point of view but you try to fit too many ideas that need further explanation into brief subclauses i have this problem too you have a static vision of the whole picture and you want to capture the entirety of this picture in each sentence however good writing operates as a process you deal with one thing at a time and gradually the guiding terms and themes that for you are obvious also become obvious for the reader build the world the expectations the logic of the characters and the narrator because these logics will always be idiosyncratic and so a reader unfamiliar to them will need to be gradually initiated into them
your descriptiveness is subtle but feels honest a little sentimental but thats fine       heres the beginning of a short story im working on throwing every at the canvas will reduce the verbosity later    1/2    my acquaintance and i met on the first snowy night of the season at a dinner party hosted by our mutual friends the esteemed governor and his wife i wish hed shut up soon had been my thought for some time as i politely sat sipping my schnapps he was raving on and on about his dearest anna and i was finding it increasingly difficult not to throttle him from across our little table i kept composed though nodded along and smiled endearingly at his every remark but inside i was beginning to boil who was this scoundrel to brag of his dearest before a lonely bachelor sipping schnapps at a dinner party and with such a scoundrels nose indeed      it began like this      picture i quietly indulging in the cocktail shrimp at my solitary office in the corner of the dining hall a waltz is being played on the piano the gentlemen are smoking their pipes or engaged in a heated game of durak or go fish and their wives are all in a flock near the hostess with her frilly red dress puckered lips and enormous pearl earrings she stands out amongst the ladies and looks more like a dream consort than the wife of that burly old man the governor a jovial air of chatter and laughter hangs over the party beholding the high stacks of pastries and sweets that had just been laid out on the table in the center of the room i am perfectly content in my own company      presently enters our devil in question who after surveying the party from the entryway catches my wandering gaze at first he acts coy his shifty eyes darting left to right in a clear mockery of suspicion but i must have been of peculiar interest to him for he very quickly begins slithering towards me through the crowd judging by the devious grin he now bares across his face  one which looks to suggest a secret intrigue or an inside joke  i realize this will not be an encounter i can easily avoid     imagine us was his grand introduction two handsome young gentlemen of the highest standard health and grooming with the whitest of teeth and a full head of hair here alone at a society party with neither of us a date by our side whats your excuse      he sat down promptly across from me plucked a shrimp from my glass and popped it into his mouth he wore a long elegant swallowtail coat fine leather boots and donned on his birds nest of curly hair a black top hat which he was evidently very proud of by the way he delicately caressed the brim between two spindly fingers his face was waxy and unusually handsome but had the disconcerting quality of a mask i mildly suspected he was not actually on his own here but it was of no consequence to me      im just here on invitation i said a lie     whats your relation to the governor he asked
    2/2    a distant nephew another lie      he leaned back in his chair and scrutinized me closely      ah well myself just out to enjoy the evening i really know nobody here with that he gave a wink oh but look the snows already beginning to fall     i turned to look out the window across the room and indeed outside soft thickets of white snow were falling gently from the darkening sky      its sure to be a wonderful night he said one might fancy a stroll through the streets if one doesnt find oneself bogged down here with this unruly bunch for too long     a little chilly for me i said     he began musing if only my dearest anna were here isnt it a sweet thing our love if only you knew on a night like tonight with such a moon in the sky shed start us off the couch with a little tickle under the arm as she usually does when some whimsical fancys got ahold of her senses and well you know women and so on     the more he spoke the more animated he became soon he was gesticulating wildly every now and then his eyes would burst aflame and hed shoot me a strange glance as if to make sure i was listening to every word he was saying and read by the look on my face the affect his words were having on me was i envious he must have thought was i impressed had i been swept away by his irresistable charm i imagined this really mattered to him the longer i sat in silence seeding him on with my courteous nods and bashful toasts his confidence seemed to grow his tone was haughty and patronizing he spoke sharply and eloquantly never skipping a beat or tripping over his own tongue but the words he spoke were shallow and monotonous bold and braggadocious clearly designed to stir with their sizzle rather than their substance he went on and on and on and only spoke of his splendid anna who by now i was convinced bore some distant relation to the late cleopatra i was at once confused irritated and at a loss for words my patience was waning as ive already mentioned it took quite a lot of restraint not to simply fling my snack in his face and walk away but i couldnt bring myself to say a word against him shy creature that i am i must have been red as a beet and sweating profusely      my eyes fell upon the candle in the center of the table its pathetic flame working desperately to free itself from the wick i scoured my mind for a way out it had even occurred to me such was my desperation that perhaps if i simply brought my feet up off the floor and onto the chair i was seated it would spring into life as if on cue and carry me out of the room like a wise and loyal animal prancing away on its four wooden legs but this never happened     perhaps shed give us a kiss at the door he went on perhaps shed give us a bite by the shore so ill go fetch the brandy says i and well make a night of it oh if only you could see her in her travelling best
this thread is on fire
socrates in particular seemed to have embodied a transformative presence one need only consider his description by alcibiades in the symposium  the following testimony of aristides captures vividly the power of socrates as an embodiment of divine wisdom he says by the gods socrates youre not going to believe this but its true ive never learned mathein anything from you as you know but i made progress whenever i was with you even if i was only in the same house and not in the same room  but more when i was in the same room and it seemed to me at least that when i was in the same room and looked at you when you were speaking i made much more progress than when i looked away and i made by far the most and greatest progress when i sat right beside you and physically held on to you or touched you theages 130d2 e2    imagine
same desu i always got better grades in college when i touched my tutor
lets try to consider if the characters in the platonic dialogues are actually not just people but some of them or maybe even all of them embodiments avatars/emanations of gods like it was said that plotinus soul was godly  ill start charmides could be an emanation of eros and socrates an embodiment of apollo  lets first try to recognise a pattern before we determine if its valid or not
    you might look at the names for clues    the name polemarchus means something like warband leader and the character is quite spirited in the republic might he represent a god in ares retinue i dont think so but maybe
  its just a hypothesis that i came up with on the spot but i find it intriguing
    thats retarded the people that participated in the dialogues were real people and some of thee dialogues really did take place like the symposium or platos apology it is cetrianly the case that plato constructed these dialogues or litterary and philosophical purposes but he didnt make up those people
  it doesnt change the possibility that they could be avatars or that only socrates could be
daily reminder plato is in unrequited love with socrates and very envious of those socrates actually likes socrates supposedly gives up alcibiadess perfect ass to pursue wisdom and lectures as the opening to so many platonic dialogues its like the snape/malfoy of the genre
  is this why theres always bitching in the dialogues about socrates wife or is it just because plato thinks women are stupid
  why were the greeks such fucking faggots
  
bump
  did you see alcibiades bod he looks like a chubby trap
  whyd he shave his legs and body hair  fucking degenerate
why is yeats so popular among schizhead pseuds like mckenna and philip k dick
  he had a very dope theory where he stated that time or rather epochs or ages was were cyclical
  he was a mystic fruitcake just like those two and also a poetic genius
  hes a pretty popular poet in general op also pkd wasnt a pseud at all he was a scifi writer who fully embraced that label after his literary fiction was rejected by publishers
  wasnt that whitehead    so yeats was the example they failed to live up to    you clearly have not read very much pkd
  wasnt that whitehead  i dont know im not familiar with his ideas i saw it mentioned first in a video essay in yt and here its a bit of an explanation 
  this the whole gyres thing in a vision might have been of interest to mckenna and pkd
why was a brilliant poet popular with people that wanted to turn words into art    gee oh pee i really do wonder what the reason could be
people who easily use the term pseud are usually pseuds themselves like you
everybody loves yeets
he was a cuckold this makes him popular among degenerate druggies for some reason
  hi noah
  why is yeats so popular among schizhead pseuds  do not discount the appeal of the very tangible revolutionary nature of his activities close associates of his were directly involved in the rising polished and tenured though he may have been he was a true troublemaker to the core all of his works from the early 1900s need to be viewed in the context that he was rallying violence against the crown
  all of his works from the early 1900s need to be viewed in the context that he was rallying violence against the crown  based irishman
  cant be a pseud if youre completely fucking nuts
what a cool fucking guy
  irish cannot control hatred for germanic overlords  becomes greatest poet in human history to subvert sassenach goblin tyrants  what a proud race
  calling something schizo is a sure sign of low iq
    its literally vico guys ever heard of brings us by a commodious vicus of recirculation back to howth castle and environs
  i mean at least mckenna and pkd were more authentic than raw the king fake schizoid
  dont you mean keats
  dont forget burroughs
  a way a lone a lost a last a loved along the
   cannot control hatred for germanic overlords  yeats was of wholly english ancestry you dumb continental
  lost his virginity at the age of 29 according to marjorie perloff  atrocious student  family thought he was mentally disabled  eugenicist with fascist sympathies  literally believed in ghosts  rejected on four separate occasions by the same woman    hes an inspiration to idiots everywhere    /ourguy/
  mckenna was right about mushrooms
  he said an awful lot about mushrooms and often selfcontradictory which bit about mushrooms do you mean
  me desu
  because yeats was schizo freakazoid
  give examples please
do you identify with harry
no hes clearly in the middle of a midlife crisis and im still in my 20s  i do sympathize with him though
  somewhat
  yes but im very mature for my age
  when im in my 40s i hope im still smoking hashish and bedding 20 something roastie actresses
have you ever read a book written by someone in here
i hope to god not
never
is it just me or was he a way more accomplished kafka    his stories creeped me out/fucked me up more than kafka in that creeping human condition kind of way    also i really wish he was still with us
  i dont know if i would say he was more accomplished than kafka he took many many pages to say something that took kafka a few lines sometimes it is also without a doubt that kafka was a better artist think of how perfectly he was able to aestheticize the failures of enlightenment and horrors of logic and reason coming to undo you dfw was a ver smart guy no doubt but there isnt always a lot of artistic stuff going on in his books which i think kafka was a master at it would be truly terrifying to perceive the world as kafka mustve
  yeah i agree they also were both funny but very like modern humor for their day funny which ages very fast
  kafka was actually sincere though
  so was dfw i think the biggest miscredit is infinite jest being called his best work/magnum opus he got better and better the older he got his nonfiction is fantastic for entertainment value and compelling for those new to nonfiction as well as nonfiction addicts and oblivion is the best short story collection of the last decade its all very sincere and humane bkt also good af he had gotten out of that edgy mindset at that point and had matured into an adult and a better artist
im not sure i find their works particularly comparable    kafka was an incredibly austere and private person who languished in his own neurotic internal abstract world     dfw was a very heart on sleeve intellectual who was desperate to be appreciated/respected he was incredibly garish and believed he understood the world around him and that his work was an attempt to quantify what he saw and try and own it or belittle it for his own artistic gain     dfw was desperate to be another kafka but was much too vain to not try and cash in on his genius which to be fair is fair enough because kafkas life was a miserly one and really to not be able to enjoy the fruits of your labour at all is quite tragic but on the other hand it was these fruits that probably completely ruined dfw as he saw how hollow his fame and wealth really were     so i guess in the end you could contrast the two mens lives but when it comes down to their writing they are miles apart     while they both might be somewhat accurately described as absurdists this only scratches the surface of their work the real meat was very different
  looks well fed rich kid of two rich professors millions in savings had a vehicle never had to worry about rent or food he had it too good for too long
what kind of person is the mule is he chill af should i read these books
hes an angry tryhard twink manlet  but yeah theyre good books i enjoyed reading them
is eliminativism the final redpill of the consciousness question
any ism that cannot be described without using the word actually can and should be dismissed out of hand  call it the retards razor if something goes against intuition its probably wrong
  all eliminativists arent people they are philosophical zombies how could they not be when they attempt to disprove our own experience of qualia by simply rejecting it
eliminativism is correct about the empirical/theoretical questions but the naive theory of reference you need in order for the idea of conceptual elimination to be so clean cut needs to be worked out
  metzinger  oh no no no no no
  t seething zimbo
  they dont reject qualia you nigger they say that its simulated and not something concrete  you post this same diatribe in every thread
stating that qualia is simulated is still rejecting it for what it is you sperg
  what is the difference between simulation and concreteness
  one has ontological status and is an independent geist with its own properties and agency the other is just an incoherenr amalgamation of subjective notions images memories and sensory experiences all of which happen automatically and have evolved to closely mirror something like physiological activity and to give the appearance of choice since it is important as a mediating cog function for decision making in the brain despite not actually being possible the distinction is extremely hard and obvious not at all another ambiguity to wedge for inserting ghosts in the machine
scrapped princess novels  tales of phantasia novels    so much light novels i cant read because i dont speak gookrunes    is this how monolingual anglo retards feel about literature
just learn japanese man its not that hard  but people will laugh at me for being a weeb  yeah and
  dude you only need to learn 1 language  but its a never ending list of languages for me
going about normal day  remember that there are parents who hate books  realise that they wont have any books in their house  realise that they dont read to their kids  realise that their kids will never get to enjoy dr seuss roald dahl winnie the pooh alice in wonderland aesops fables or fairy tales outside of possibly school  realise that these kids will only know books in the context of having to read them in school  get irrationally angry  its not right
  be me  26 years old  have not read alice in wonderland  just
its ther dont you know what ther means  theyll be okay even christopher robin survived sort of 
  my father was a pathological narcissist and a hoarder and he was pretty much absent throughout my life he had lots of books but he would never lend me one so i grew up without  now that he is dead his books are stored in cardboard boxes which ill probably never open since i associate those books with him
  breathe slowly and look at this
  be me  remember that is the opposite of my parents growing up  read tolkien early  zoomed through all the goosebumps books in 3rd grade  first book was a big ass insect biology book called the big bug book  life is fair
  mostly gay biology/law thesisshit written by dead white dudes who were dead wrong on every point  no thanks
  at least sell them or something if you just give them away you dont even have to open the boxes
  how about this
  what kinds of books  thats an interesting story
  thinking any of that matters    kids dont even want that gay shit they have video games now stay mad boomer
  so libraries are dead where you are
  lol untrue
  when i was growing up the only kids who read were the losers whose parents were too poor to buy them a game console    not everyone wants their kid to grow up into the kind of friendless beta aspie that you see on this board
  dead white dudes  please go back you insufferable rat
  lots of pulpy crime novels and most of the classics like gullivers travels don quixote around the world in 80 days etc
  my mother would be against selling them we have a lot of junk around the house
  this is the way it should be  plebs shouldnt be taught the written word  thats what generates pseuds
  where did you grow up compton
  this makes me very happe
  not him that picture is highly distressing to me and is making me nauseous please delete
the horse moved across the top of the hill

is right about everything
this thread slap every time
  yeah maybe but id still kick his ass
    neocons
keep up the sowellposting my friend he deserves to be a household name
  thats how i think you look like
  i didnt ask you that spic
  i picked up a few sowell books thinking i would mostly agree with him and maybe even learn a thing or two i was disappointed to learn how frequently wrong and misguided he is is sowell the nonthinking mans thinking man i dont understand his popularity
  any examples
  you didnt ask him anything actually also that probably is what you look like
  out of curiosity what do you think sowell gets wrong
okay this fucking slaps
okay this is fucking gay
  it really cracks the whip
dicks going into butts
  its for gays
idk man like is some kind of weird snarkception the way they make fun of all the awful nytimes oped writers but at the same time they are awful oped wriers themselves that should be parodied its like they completely exemplify soi culture with no irony like now someone needs to make a snarty podcast that makes fun of snarky podcasts i think theyre getting to the nytimes scum tho because i swear michelle goldberg used the terms transactional and husk in the same column its working youre hitting them keep going go go gojust dont fucking overdose on soi and nintendo ok
  burgers were a mistake
  based
is the title ironic i fail to see how anyone can come to the conclusion that logic should be avoided but yknow poes law
  yeah i dont get the subtitles its like ben shapiro has em shook and theyre like ok ok this shit isnt logical or reasonable dont ask us to debate on twitter plz seems kinda beta t b h
      post ur hogs
  fuck ben shapiro but u know a true ideological gee like lenin or trump would be like come at me bitch lets get it on my shit is airtight
    if you are familiar with their arguments basically the point is that they think the words rational and logical etc are just buzzwords used to essentially naturalize neoliberal capitalism in a way that dehumanizes people into productive units for the neoliberal ruling class so theyre not attacking rationality as a concept theyre attacking the specific neoliberal usage so yes its ironic
  these guys are the epitome of fucking soi pussies id guess collectively they could lift 300 pounds burn this trash
  and marx didnt do that
  tu quoque try harder next time sweety
  theyre litetally being proppedup by establishment figures like patton oswalt theyve past captials event horizon and havent even realised it
  thats only tu quoque if hes suggesting that marx as an individual dehumanized people if marx as a thinkeror marxs thought initself then hes merely pointing out an inconsistency which is not a fallacy
  if marx qua thinker or marxism itself    dehumanized people
  dude every leftist movement is propped up by some rich asshole since the days engels propped up marx and the german government propped up lenin and it just keeps going
    it slaps mens nuts against mens butts for promoting such ideological drivel to impressionable youths
  youre on par with mde posters i hope you know that
  mde posters are basically why im here
  thats because youre a nerd nerd
  yep high/low vs the middle a perennial pattern summarizes the history of mans struggle for power well
  okay this is fucking epic
chapo trap house fans are gay
chapo fag house is jew nepotism at its worst
faggo onions house
these are the people calling you chuds  what the fuck is a chud anyway
  the npc chapo defender has arrived
the issue with chapo is it is being subsumed by the liberalleft idpol that it began as a pisstake of    just a bunch of retarded students looking for an aesthetic nothing new
  its amazing how they cant see that idpol is a replacement for class the left should hate this stuff and yet it fully embraces it despite its only achievement being convincing people its mandatory
  the wests embracement of idpol is a wonderful gift to the far right not only does it alienate the actual working class from the modern left but all the idpol language and philosophy can easily be applied to anything the far right wants
  i meant the lefts embracement of idpol damnit
using idpol unironically  class obsession
  what can a man do so that his kid doesnt end up like this  i think physical education should help although this guy looks slightly deformed it might be a medical condition but im not sure about the rest    i think at some level leftism is just resentful subpar people grouping together and demanding free stuff  they should be taught humility/compassion and learn to appreciate greatness even if theyre not the ones who succeed
  idpol is a replacement for class    the wests embracement of idpol    imagine being this fucking retarded how short sighted conceited and historically illiterate do you have to be to think identity politics is a creation a creation of the west nonetheless     all politics are identity politics
  indeed the far rights idpol is so much better as well promises power right out of the gate where as the left promises you solidarity which you dont even get since everyone is too busy chopping up their personhood to stick a currency on it to bargain for airtime
  teach your kid physical education youd be surprised at how effective it can be some studies even suggest that your political views change as your body becomes fitter but i dont know how much of that is true
chapo trap house  no actual cute traps with feminine penises    this fucking gay
    that term is so vague that literally any movement for power can be illustrated as such
  some studies even suggest that your political views change as your body becomes fitter but i dont know how much of that is true  who still keep spreading this myth the original study showed that working class leftists are fitter while upper class right wingers are fitter hell even previous studies before that showed that in general left wingers are more fitter than right wingers yet through diffusion and osmosis this nuance is dead to fit and push right wingers narratives
  he is deformed look at the angle of his feet
  pretty sure hes got some sort of legit problem with his legs he walks with a pretty pronounced limp no idea if its a congenital thing or a bad injury though
  i personally blame the red scares for purging any classism in the discourse
i found it kind of forgettable desu its mostly just reiterating the same shit that they talk about in the podcast but without the spontaneity of conversation epigram game was top tier tho
literally /tv/ memes
  show me where they banepost
  cringe
  all politics are identity politics  class is not an identity you fuck    not everything is about you trying out being a gay    people have to eat you retard imbecile
      wow im blown away by the overwhelming logic and brainpower behind your verbose and succinct arguments    are all /pol/posters capable of such deep thought or are you three the intellectual leaders of your movement
  i cant imagine being so dumb i dont realize wealth isnt an immutable aspect of life     this is your brain on intersectionality and beyoncé super bowl performances
  its drugs it means drugs
  identity doesnt have to be immutable religion is mutable as is being a tranny
  are all /pol/posters capable of such deep thought or are you three the intellectual leaders of your movement  speaking of three intellectual leaders would you listen to any advice given by pic related or would you dismiss them as untermenschen
    meme signalling your commie ingroup on a bulgarian basketweaving forum
  would you listen to any advice given by one of western civilizations greatest thinkers or would you dismiss him as a 4ft goblin untermenschen
why do businesses tolerate people who want the dissolution of the system that allows for their existence and the leaders of the business put up against walls and shot but act as the implacable enemies of those who say mean words about browns    it almost leads one to believe in the presence of a conspiracy of certain coethnics
  dey stoopid becus dey ugleee    feels  reels
  feels  reels  dont worry hes not just ugly but also stupid just look at 
  that was pretty deep
  thanks
  why do businesses tolerate people who want the dissolution of the system that allows for their existence and the leaders of the business put up against walls and shot    its almost as if the bit of profit they gain from them and marketing to their fanbase outdoes the very very low precentage of that content having any true impact on their company    are you really that delusional to think that petty moral stigmas will outway the need for a company to make as much money as possible
  every time i see gringos like this one i often wonder if they realize the third worlders they so idolize are extremely more problematic than the peers they constantly complain about
how do people justify being socialist when there is no conceivable solution to the knowledge problem socialism is objectively less efficient than the market economy
  explain market socialism then
  superior ashkenazi genetics stupid goy
  do you mean fascism
  ah yes the famous jewish surname christman
  no
  i dont know what you want from me
  you smell of reddit the very way you type its all redditlike its disgusting
  do you think pol types dont similarly ree at their neoliberal indoctronated family    learn to appreciate greatness even if theyre not the ones who succeed    right when someone has to sell their fucking fields medal to pay for hospital costs theyre a failure but when someone far less intelligent happens to just get lucky in business which is the good majority of their time theyre sucessful
  so youre saying patreon have made the judgement that chapos messages and espousal of revolutionary communism are too limp dicked to effect the zeitgeist and bring about their downfall    are you really that delusional to think that petty moral stigmas will outway the need for a company to make as much money as possible  yeah have you been living under a rock from corporations to small businesses literally everyone is obsessed with so called petty moral stigmata
  theres a market for everything ironically even for people who fundementally hate the entire system like isnt it ironic how many commies there is on shit like twitter there is no way to avoid capital
  based reddithunter
    this book is badso is their juvenile take on foreign policy
  success is relative and situational with a good amount of luck involved you shouldnt take it so personally  you can improve the system somewhat but at the end of the day some people are going to be smarter or better looking or whatever that will give them the edge and put them on top to be hated by people who dont even understand much of whats going on and just want free stuff
  my impression of them is basically that they are the following   marx lite  chomsky lite  twitter snark  /pol/style political mockery     they and the dirtbag left in general come off to me as some kind of leftist reaction to /pol/s rightwing adoption of using irony to attack any sincere alternative positions to make their opponents look foolish while simultaneously not having to hold the burden of defending their own positions or proposing any type of sensible reform for society anyone who is sincere is an open target for mockery they however cannot be mocked because they are not sincere they are ironic the jester cannot be responded to without the target appearing ineffectual strong tactic essentially saying you mad bro the responder can either say yes im mad and appear a fool or say no im not and appear defensive and weak     it allows them to toss of any semblance of epistemic humility and avoid active dialogue or engagement of any kind with opponents since the views of those who disagree with them cannot possibly have any merit     again tho idk i havent seriously engaged with the book or podcast maybe im just some sort of retard this is what i glean from brief visits to their reddit and twitter pages so i can read the absolute garbage their fanbase spews
god cth has to be the cringiest gayest shit online right now does anyone even listen to those literal cuckolds
  market socialists are usually antibiggov guys like gesell some neogeorgists proudhon etc are usually about buy local
  marx lite  chomsky lite  twitter snark  /pol/style political mockery  you forgot  reddittier soiinfused opinions made apparent when discussing race/racism makes sense seeing how youre a redditor yourself and perhaps dont see the reddit just how a fish doesnt see water
  jew botnets
  i cant have a conversation with you if you dont define your terms i dont know what you mean by market socialist it doesnt make any sense to me because socialism is the centralized distribution of scarce resources when you add market to it and it becomes a contradiction because by market people usually mean a price coordinated distribution of resources    i cant read your mind
  socialism  workers in control of means of production
  oh fuck off you retarded cunt you can call the government or whoever is distributing resources the workers but it doesnt change the definition
  the difference between socialist and capitalist economies has to do with the ownership of the means of production there isnt any reason that you couldnt have market socialism or even command capitalism
  they and the dirtbag left in general come off to me as some kind of leftist reaction to /pol/s rightwing adoption of using irony to attack any sincere alternative positions to make their opponents look foolish while simultaneously not having to hold the burden of defending their own positions or proposing any type of sensible reform for society anyone who is sincere is an open target for mockery they however cannot be mocked because they are not sincere they are ironic the jester cannot be responded to without the target appearing ineffectual strong tactic essentially saying you mad bro the responder can either say yes im mad and appear a fool or say no im not and appear defensive and weak     this stops working whenever any edgy joke forces you need to make apologies to your audience or whoever whines about it /pol/ will never have this problem because no one there claims theyre morally elevated
  youre not disagreeing with my definition of socialism but youre too stupid to see it now you want to talk about command capitalism after telling me you werent talking about fascism youre not a good thinker
  is english your first launguage i have no idea how you could misinterpret me to such a bad degree the centralization or decentralization of an economic system does not determine whether it is capitalist or socialist market socialism is so far away from fascism on the political spectrum that i cannot understand how you could mix the two up
  yep high/low vs the middle a perennial pattern summarizes the history of mans struggle for power well  pic related
  worst post in this thread if all politics is identity politics then it simply ceases to be an useful term and we should just use the word politics fucking retard
  they dont really think of them period they are just props in an overarching progressive morality play to be pointed to in order to attack the morality of your opponents
  hey are you chewingofthecud
  no idea who youre talking about lad
  i am curious to see which democratic donors provided the startup funding and promotion for chapo
  right when someone has to sell their fucking fields medal to pay for hospital costs theyre a failure but when someone far less intelligent happens to just get lucky in business which is the good majority of their time theyre sucessful  that guy was 96 years old dude
  on the subject of economics you are legitimately retarded youre actually worse than somebody who never attempted to study economics because at least they arent so confidently confused
  the way hes posed looks like a giant toddler
  theres a toddler in the background who is dressed just like him someone on /pol/ said that it was the universe mocking him
  pray tell then socrates the difference between market socialism and fascism
  yes that is a definitive component i forgot to add this feeling of moralistic superiority is both a blessing and curse it makes them beholden to the perception of their message among their desired ingroup thus necessitating apologies and an appropriate level of virtuesignaling to communicate with their desired ingroup that fear not we are one of you     however it also allows them to adopt some reprehensible positions that would be plainly morally wrong but believe they are virtuous in their beliefs because they posses a moral highground     this is how they can unironically call for the assassination of republican congress members or endless mock targets both big and small yet believe they hold a moral highground since their believed ends a socialist/labor utopia justify the means theres also a degree of belief that since their enemy engages in similar underhanded tactics that it is thus morally justified to respond inkind
youre fed a steady diet of thin flavorless gruel by your leaders your parents fake friends who love drama the fascist mods on erowid and r/celebritytoes the lying sheeple news media and most especially all previous works of political satire and comedy    p funny
  try to think for one minute in a socialist government how would goods get from the warehouse to the consumer some sort of authority or bureau will have to direct where those resources go that is the centralized distribution of scarce resources when you tell me that socialism is instead the workers owning the means of production youre not actually saying anything useful or disagreeing with my definition of socialism youre just repeating slogans in an effort to mimic intelligent thought    you still havent defined market socialism so i have no idea what the fuck you mean by that but if youre wanting to know what a command economy is then look no further than fascism italy or nazi germany generally speaking its the government granting monopoly rights to private companies and directed by fiat how much is produced and where
  a employee owned factory contracts an employee owned retailer to sell their goods they compete against other employee owned businesses market socialism
  this pattern psycho intellectual elite shrieking at its population for perceived immorality has a long history in the us i cant think of another country in which the theoretical ruling class hates its own people so much maybe its because weve always been a republic run by brahmintypes
  what are you telling me this for make an argument you daft cunt
  they need a good reason to kill or imprison them who wants to make a martyrs out of three retards
  why do businesses tolerate people who want the dissolution of the system that allows for their existence and the leaders of the business put up against walls and shot but act as the implacable enemies of those who say mean words about browns    because the whole put businessmen up against the wall isnt really meant to happen most of these activists are indirectly on the payroll of businessmen via philanthropic foundations ford rockefeller open society tides carnegie etc and are mobilized for the purposes of expanding the power of their patrons who on the business side are often financiers see herbert marcuse being supported by the rockefeller foundation civil rights being bankrolled by the ford foundation may 1968 in france as the product of angloamerican intel agencies promoting antirussian leftists for a few examples when you create a slew of protected classes poc gays trans persons you then need a legal infrastructure to enforce those laws which expands progressive power and turns those groups into moral bludgeons that can be used against your opponents businesses have to play along with wokeness but its not the end of the world for them in most cases business is hardly a uniform group in the us anyway different business groups have different interests and fund different factions
  owning the libtards epic style  replace libtards with chuds and you get chapo trap house in a nutshell
  no it cant you could most likely find particular cases that support your claim but not a robust pattern do away with your philosophy of difference
  its less mockery than it is an effort to establish the opposition as not worthy of consideration
  the commodification of dissent is perhaps the single greatest weapon of capitalism it neuters and diludes any possibility of genuine revolutionary thought and the best part is they do it to themselves  in fact i think memes and the rise of widespread irony is another sign of this
  you just summarized most of my thoughts on memes and irony politics
  rapist frat house  but why

  chud is from a 1984 schlock horror movie featuring cannibalistic humanoid underground dwellers
  dude every leftist movement is propped up by some rich asshole since the days engels propped up marx  thats totally the same as the fact that modern leftists frighten corporate interests more than trump
  and where exactly is the insult
  i get a panic attack every time i see pics of this fag because the possibility of ending up like him scares the shit out of me    how do you fail so hard that your appearance communicates pure worthlessness
  implying actual leftists are even prominent enough for corporations to even care about

what bothers me most is just how poring and didactic they are even the liberal comedians they bash seem to have better comedic sensibilities than them and their rather dull edge doesnt really make up for it
  but who the hell would feel insulted by that insults like basedboy cuck npc etc at least can hurt but who the hell would feel insulted by being called a chud
is this prose kino
    not the op you replied to but a better way to think about it is that under socialism acquisition of capital is no longer the goal or highest virtue of members of society     all the exploitation of workers the natural given environment etc comes from the ceaseless attempt to seek more capital through the seeking of further surplusvalue from the workers people tend to focus more on the surplusvalue end of it but logically getting more capital allows you to get more workers and extract more surplus value from each worker    under socialism you could in principle have any way of organizing supply chains hiring people etc provided that does not reproduce the worship of capital and the maximal extraction of surplusvalue     there is nothing wrong with some form of market or responsiveness to demand but there is everything wrong with a concept of freedom which promotes growing extraction of surplus value at the cost of the workers and indeed everyone and everything that doesnt own capital ie the current arrangements the west has

why are all of you so insecure and crying over a podcast
  you do realize thats the reason the podcast is there right if they were as leftie as they proclaim they would shed the excess money by throwing it in a trashcan or something
  source on that  even if thats true thats still not what a 1er is
  what does that even mean  do you think they want to abolish currency or something
  why do people like you have this idiotic idea that anybody with left wing politics has to burn all of their money beyond the point of paying for the bare minimum of utilities and most wooden and lifeless standard of living possible otherwise theyre hypocritical and intellectually malicious and dishonest    how do you fuck up political ideology this bad
  rightwing american propaganda from the past 50 years has eroded their brains  it is actually baffling how little americans know about their own countrys history and the history of ideologies outside the republican party
    because it signals they care very little about real change they like shouting into the void empty critiques that wont reach anyone whilst earning 1520k a month each   but yeah keep spouting viva la revolution or something
  its trash
    the change they want isnt for people to be poor or not use money so i dont see how their lifestyle is in conflict with their views
  their podcast is the embodiment of left wing politics and the labor movement  they work when they want on their own schedule they arent owned by a company they own their own capital and they take the full benefit of their entertainment product that they create    theres nothing hypocritical about it
  and im very happy you can be satisfied by such an embodiment as peruvian workers are still slaving away for the equipment they use the clothes they wear the entertainment they create  all whilst them still not wishing real change as they are comfortable where they are now making a loweffort podcast where critiquing is synonymous to spouting your opinion in a very hospitable echo chamber
  you definitely dont have the intimate knowledge to know whether they use responsiblysourced products  and even if you did that doesnt make their criticisms invalid appeal to hypocrisy/tu quoque  its not like them getting their ideological wishes would change their lifestyle for the worse anyway
  so you have to build your own circuit boards computers microphones wiring internet soundcloud platform webpage grow your own food stitch your own clothes create your own dye build your own house create your own plumbing be your own doctor etc otherwise youre a hypocrite if you are left wing    youre retarded    its okay to say you dont like something nobody cares its not going to change anything or be some profound statement to society to say you dont like listening to the chapo trap house podcast you dont have to pretend that there is some catastrophic hypocritical evil agenda that theyre abusing to live off of sweet sweet neetbux while secretly voting for paul ryan 40 times every election theyre comedians that make politically themed entertainment theyre not politicians or bureaucrats in charge of policy you can just not like them you dont have to listen to them you dont have to do anything you dont want to     nobody gives a shit about you being iconoclastic over popular entertainment to give yourself the illusion of having a personality
  its not going to change anything or be some profound statement to society   theyre comedians that make politically themed entertainment    very good description of what chapo and their useless praxis is indeed keep shilling keep dishing out your 
  what are you even mad at
  if you dont think easy money is a good thing youre jaded
chapo is a comedy podcast and anyone who actually takes them seriously is a limp dick demsucc at best most likely a lib though    the boys are funny but the fact that dipshits give them over a million dollars a fucking year to work probably 8 hours a week is the dumbest shit ive ever heard
  give them over a million dollars a fucking year to work probably 8 hours a week is the dumbest shit ive ever heard  why

  the way you used engels as a representation of the high means any movement with a class traitor could fit that model
kek why do these nerds make people here so mad theyre some succdems with a podcast who cares they obviously arent going to change much its just for latte hipsters to laugh and feel like they have the right ideas and opinions theres plenty of right wing alternatives
  its ripping off mdes style which has cryptobeat roots in burroughs etc but removing all potentially offensive things from it that it is leavened with abstruse cliches is either to make the reader feel bad for not getting them or make them feel good for existing in the weird twitter/brooklyn leftist chapo milieu    also the character type they link with amis and wodehouse clearly suggests to me that they have in fact read neither of them craggy but loveable is something associated more with popular representatives of that period ie downton abbey than actual literary works revolving around that class
  good post      no need there is a big enough audience of failsons with money i didnt come up with the term that is what they call themselves
it read like an hst book without the bite
  you can improve the system somewhat but at the end of the day some people are going to be smarter or better looking or whatever that will give them the edge and put them on top to be hated by people who dont even understand much of whats going on and just want free stuff  obey your superiors and dont question the unearned birthrights of the rich  literal bootlicker

why is it that any possible political opinion leads you to accidentally join the ranks of a bunch of bumbling retards who use that opinion as their identity and make you feel like an idiot just for agreeing with them  i try to discuss leftism expecting eugene v debs and am instead met with weak pudgy faggots that think marvel superheroes are the high point of western culture and that working class people disliking trannies is a worse injustice than actual capitalist exploitation

  anarchist calling anyone a brocialist  lmao remember when anarchists had grit now you cant even insult a tranny without them reeeeing their eyes out
  are you still here christ dude are you their little pet slave or something
  no i just saw this thread being bumped on the frontpage
  but if you march around demanding unisex bathrooms you get to virtue signal without any blowback  why the fuck did this all change so fast and why are unions themselves okay with subverting their own interests to fight for stupid bullshit that doesnt benefit them in the slightest and distracts from real working class grievances i get that the top leadership is corrupt but why the fuck did rank and file adopt this insanity too
  umm sweaty the real working class are reactionary whites very problematic
  please do so i beg you    t white guy attending university in first world country surrounded by onionsmunching faggots
  are the working class involved in this at all
    why would you insult transexuals pretty shitty thing to do
  why would i pretend theyre normal women pretty stupid to do desu
cth fans become really transparent when they drop their detached internet cool guy personas to passionately defend fags and trannies
  they probably think it will attract more to their cause like how many became friendly towards immigrants and even illegal immigrants its for the pr youll get a nice headline doesnt mean people will actually give a shit to join though
  why not barely anyone actually fucking likes chicks with dicks such a superficial person and problem thats blown out of proportion everywhere
  if a union starts to welcome illegal immigrants thats a sign that they no longer give a shit about their nations working class and thus no longer have a reason to exist and no reason to give them money
  are trannies corporate capitalisms greatest red herring
  and the illegals dont even fucking join because they can skip the rules and be scabs that all squat together in some apartment shits fucked
    their existence doesnt affect you at all you dont have to pretend anything going out of your way to insult them is quite shitty
  you dont have to pretend anything  i do when they insist i use the correct pronounce and im sure as hell not going to call a dude with a 5 o clock shadow a her    also they are disgusting on a fundamental level similar to the morbidly obese which means their very existence is offensive
  i do when they insist i use the correct pronounce and im sure as hell not going to call a dude with a 5 o clock shadow a her    and that affects you how exactly why does it matter to you what they ask to be referred to as is it honestly a challenge for you to replace a word to make another human being feel okay
  child rapists dont affect you therefore live and let live brah
  is it honestly a challenge to entertain someones delusions  yes yes it is
    child rapists affect peace though they actively harm others a transexual simply existing doesnt         how
  people should stop being so harsh on you since youre clearly autistic i mean that in a literal unironic sense
  certainly a name that 19th century jewish converts to christianity would choose for themselves i guarantee that thing has jewish genetics
  any denial of truth or the good is harmful for people a guy that wants to cut his own healthy arm off isnt physically hurting anyone but we stop him anyways because physical harm doesnt matter if you think it does you would have to also be against dentistry since they physically harm people to fulfill a good work telling people that men can be women is harmful because its not true
  if you dont consider pic related to be girls then youre autistic  uhuh
  incels dont affect anyone either but they sure make the left angry as fuck
  because just calling them whatever meme pronoun they want still doesnt make them feel okay there are things fundementally wrong with these people
  tell that to ebitches who owe taxes
  muh mass shooter incels
  those are just individual incels the incel lifestyle doesnt harm anyone other than themselves
  its called getting your foot in the door they ask for something that seems like the slightest bit of leeway that instead fundamentally changes the way we think and act changing the way someone speaks is a direct infringement on freedom of speech and its juvenile to assume someone should change the way they speak because you have a mental illness listed in the dsmv
  so do you hate them because theyre irony poisoned or because they actually care about something despite being broadly disillusioned
  so basically mde but for leftist redditors          fuck off retard
  fuck off retard  not him but solid argument
    youre absolutely right one moment theyre asking you to politely call them by what they wish to be called and hurts no one but suddenly once they get that theyre asking you to chop their dicks off for them with a cleaver when will the madness stop its killing me argh tony
  who said anything about an argument
  i think the next step would actually be transgender bathrooms
  not him but have you ever considered that social shaming is actually an extremely sophisticated rhetorical and biologically evolved system that literally developed alongside humans thats deeply interlocked with out well being    so really calling someone a retard is actually pretty rock solid i dont even know why this guy is calling you a retard but stop being such a panty waste faggot and just call him a retard back
  politely  lmao they often act as if you just accused them of murder if you misgender them    and ive already seen people claim that youre transphobic if youre unwilling to date a tranny and stick it in that disgusting wound they have down there so no thanks im not going to accomodate them whatsoever
  waaah why doesnt everyone else conform to my plagued worldview   arrest these bad men for not blindly accepting mental illness
trannies need to be executed
  motherfucker i guarantee youve got something listed in the dsmv its a massively inclusive and everchanging text because the science of neurology and the study of psychology are deeply incomplete being gay used to be in the dsm now its not weve learned and updated our heuristics for mental illness feminine hysteria used to be a psychological condition as well and if you were alive when the diagnosis was falling out of vogue then im sure you would have protested that as well the problem here isnt trans people or the dsm its your uncritical stubborn insistence that the progress of human knowledge and understanding should stop exactly where youre comfortable with it youre a coward yet you act as though its brave to stand up to a marginalized hyperminority who are basically invisible to you if you live offline    even if there was a massive overton window shift as a result of you elected to use someones preferred pronouns there wouldnt be you still have no external reason to think that would be a negative societal event but youre some veryonline retard so itll happen with or without you because you basically dont exist
  tranny angry
  being slightly avoidant is in the dsmv but its not nearly as bad as cut off my genitals and pump me full of hormone blockers    the problem here isnt trans people or the dsm its your uncritical stubborn insistence that the progress of human knowledge and understanding should stop exactly where youre comfortable with it    this is fucking bullshit trannies are extremely sensitive whenever someone wants to inquire whether being a tranny is actually a mentally disorder and they pounce on anyone with transitionary regret with the same ferocity as salafists when they find an apostate
  i see them all the time but thats because ive been in an uni catholic society for a couple of years unironically supporting abstinence religious and saintly life is pretty normal among a lot of young catholics especially women  the douay rheims is best/latin mass only/pope francis is terrible/everythings been bad since the council of trent/i still watch anime tho tradcath is very rare to find tho
  not him but have you ever considered that social shaming is actually an extremely sophisticated rhetorical and biologically evolved system that literally developed alongside humans thats deeply interlocked with out well being  nah im six and ive literally never been outside or read anything also i have downs syndrome and im posting from my moms phone with bigtext mode on    the dude he was engaging with was clearly trying for an argument and was trying to lay out some points of contention ignoring that and calling him a retard isnt shaming its being an arrogant piece of shit might work among likeminded peers because you dont have to state a counterargument but as far as real life goes its only gonna hurt you
  uhh who cares bro  it doesnt hurt you just forget about it  argument  lmao shut the fuck up already you mentally ill freak
  trannies are extremely sensitive whenever someone wants to inquire whether being a tranny is actually a mentally disorder and they pounce on anyone with transitionary regret with the same ferocity as salafists when they find an apostate  unfair generalization again youre too fucking online youve got confirmation bias because youre weak as shit and you cant actually think youre basically a sponge for all the altright faggots to jizz their halfbaked ideas into whens the last time youve talked to a trans person everyone ive ever spoken with has been a happy person who knows what they want a hell of a lot more than most people i meet thats not the case for everyone but then what is
  is that supposed to be a bad thing
  i guess i assumed since were talking about tranny trash bags you most likely didnt understand language but aye my bad playa
  when did i say any of that
  i worked at a vegan place and can confirm that trans people are like this its definitely a thing but it has less to do with them being trans than it has to go with their shitty progressive idealism i guess thats the thing trannies are progressives and progressives are trannies and theres literally nothing else
  the dude he was engaging with was clearly trying for an argument and was trying to lay out some points of contention
  m8 like half of them off themselves theyre not happy
  im standing up for my right to think and say what i want gender dysphoria is a legitimate illness and i say this as someone who has suffered from it you need to get over the fact that people arent going to change what they say just because it offends you i fucking hate you people and you all made a decision to read minds and no one talks about it because you know you have something to hide and then systematically forces me into submission like im just supposed to be okay with it i hate you and your kind for what you are and i wont ever change that until the day i die
  i dont hate them i think they pick their battles very poorly
  i think youre condescending control freaks on a power trip
  to clarify the obsession with particular social issues eg the numerous varieties of sexual deviant we are meant to not ignore for some reason seems ironic to me given that massive corporate interests have played a huge role in popularizing gay culture especially in the last two decades homosexuals and people unsure about their gender etc are as much victims of consumerist trash as fat people who eat too much mcdonalds people who drink themselves to death gambling addicts etc etc by uncritically embracing these newly popularised sexual identities you ignore the fact that they were popularised by capitalists in a culture based around capitalist economics and the main reason for popularizing them was undoubtedly to just give people more things to consume
    i bet hes never fucked a girl hotter than a 6/10 at best
  so how do we fix it and how do we stop the literal brainwashing or is that such an inherent part of our culture that its impossible to avoid
  the writing is fucking lovecraftian
  t person who has never interacted with a tranner
for all of their faults the chapo faggots still have a better gauge on what the working class actually wants ie decent health care and jobs that arent uber permatemp gig shit the patron was both a blessing and a curse it chained them to the politics of people who mostly dont have to deal with those concerns      to roll back the social changes that have occurred up unto now would require literal government sponsored reeducation camps and broad censorship i kind of hope that 4chan is still selfaware and antiauthoritarian to know what kind of pandoras box this is
  take your pills alice
  i should add that chapo is at their best when they discard the ironybro riff city shit and just channel pure rage and hatred for americas oligarchs and the simpering liberals that refuse to fight them    listening to felix rip into doonesbury is still cathartic they should just go full rush limbaugh and turn each episode into a two minutes hate for trust fund faggots and small business ownertyrants
  youre going to be here for a while dude does it hurt you to know that no matter what you do i will always have to listen to me if you want to feel close to these people that you mean less to this world than a piss stain compared to me stick around for a while man
  lol someones mad
in a hundred years people are going to read posts like whats in this thread and wonder why society saw rampant automation destabilizing society and chose to freak out about trannies instead   and im mostly picking on conservatives here at least the trannies have an excuse for talking about themselves nonstop why do conservatives sink so much fuming time into something so insignificant and pointless most normal nononline people dont really care
  you need me more than i need you you clown
  i see my mans literally retarded
  so insignificant and pointless  encouraging and entertaining a mental illness is not pointless telling confused vulnerable young people to ruin their lives through surgery should not be encouraged
  this is incoherent homosexuality and sexual deviancy vastly predate the capitalist hegemony just because capitalists have capitalized on representation as a vehicle for increasing profits does not mean that they are the source of atypical sexual identification
  imagine not growing a new vagina with stem cells
  literally mocks proles  imagine taking these fools seriously
  if anything this seems to be mocking the democratic party for losing their support from the working class more than blue collar democrats
  mocking them as racists and old is peak dsa thought they just want to use the cloak of socialism so they can get free medicaid and to get brown people to like them
  so they can get free medicaid and to get brown people to like them  for what purpose the dsa isnt full of people who cant afford healthcare and if they went all in on the rights project then it absolutely wouldnt matter if poc liked them or not
  i hate chapo that said the point of the extract is that they only became paranoid racist republicans because of president jimmy carters unwillingness to support key factors of the bluecollars ecosystem its clearly critiquing the democratic party
  its gladly ignoring how an anticoal message will cost the dems west virginia
  nd if they went all in on the rights project then it absolutely wouldnt matter if poc liked them or not  they wont have to be worried with medical expenses so they can put their efforts towards their inane hobbies
  will it though lee carter winning was quite a surprise
  if nick wrote a book id read it
  succcdems replaying the freikorp strategy check out our based and redpilled vets and spooks   wake me up when they conceive of something original and not gay
  if it works 
  so they can put their efforts towards their inane hobbies  yeah nah thats still incoherent youll still need money in order to pay taxes and live a decent life even if ubi were brought into effect youd still need money to make make jewelry or write or do the things that make life worth living like travelling and going out with friends
  reformism will work this time guise
  if you think that theres anything else we can do at this point youve got something else coming to you
  as graeber pointed out any reformist project creates bullshit jobs and subsequently pushing down wages in the dsas wetdream enough gibs programs exist that it creates the conditions for retards to be free to pursue their stupid dreams imagine how many women would move to la to pursue their aspirations like art or acting if they had a govt stipend to do so    capital consumption in 2028 severe shortage of walmart greeters debtcollectors telemarketers personal assistants and camwhores
  if you think that theres anything else we can do at this point youve got something else coming to you  pretty sure assad and kim jong un are holding off the forces of international capital
  severe shortage of walmart greeters debtcollectors telemarketers personal assistants and camwhores  and thats a bad thing should we keep forcing our most vulnerable into the alienation machine that is modern meaningless itinerant work it does nothing for humanity nothing at all further what makes you think that people will have the money to move to la without working
  kek move to syria then anarkiddie
  of course there would be a rough transition period if you actually implemented their project things would level out eventually theyd have to
  capital accumulation still is rampant only this time the stock of truvada has shot up
  the entire purpose of the project is to forestall capital accumulation whether people get pozzed up from raw dogging afterwards is on them just like it was before
  eliminate homosexuals and fascism will vanishmaxim gorky
  gorky parroting stalinist propaganda meant to discredit fascists is not the basis of a coherent worldview regardless it wasnt even true at the time gorkys actual quotation used the word exterminate not eliminate and the nazi party did a lot more homosexual extermination than gorky ever did
  overall a compelling analysis at least in terms of how a member of a counterculture might see themself but i cant help but feel that hes falling into the historicist trap of treating history as a process but only ever in hindsight
  its almost as though class and identity are abberations of a particular set of conditions over a given period of time rather than actual components of some grand mechanistic narrative
  telling confused vulnerable young people to ruin their lives through surgery should not be encouraged  youre falling victim to an obvious moral panic
  abberations of a particular set of conditions  of capitalism you mean imperialism if so then their social construction doesnt diminish their reality
  capitalism in the marxist tradition is an arbitrary distinction what i am reffering to is a coincidence of cultural mores in which certain attributes on a hierarchy of needs are accentuated there is no grand teleology in this sense things like class and identity are interchangeable insofar as we focus our methodology and scope of analysis appropriately
  to be fair the high rate of tranny suicides is pretty alarming as well
  i never claimed that capitalism created homosexuality i said it popularised it  took it from being an irrelevant aberration that can be easily ignored to a popular social movement which demands celebration its gay culture and gay identity which is created by capitalism not homosexual behaviour itself and it is this gay culture and identity that is inexplicably celebrated by socially leftist anticapitalists
  under socialism acquisition of capital is no longer the goal or highest virtue of members of society   this is totally retarded even if i were to assume the viewpoint of an unironic marxist no margin no mission
  even mild celebrity is an automatic access to pussy
  saying that capitalism was the impetus of its popularization is the same as saying that capitalism created it in the contemporary context
    please go on your menial unavoidable infighting makes me rock hard
  and why are unions themselves okay with subverting their own interests to fight for stupid bullshit that doesnt benefit them in the slightest and distracts from real working class grievances  how has the ibew done this
  gay identity is created by science mixed with victorian prudishness read foucault u illiterate shit
  west virginia has 4 electoral votes no one cares about wv except racists who care about poor whites like trump
  read foucault u illiterate shit  ironic given that reading foucault destroys so many peoples capacity for literacy
thoughts
i have it on my iphone but i didnt read it yet i started reading on grammatology from that other fag today on the train and it fucking sucks half hour in and he didnt say shit at least hit me with a hook like how foucault opens disicpline and punish with that dude getting ripped apart by horses or w/e u feel me
  its for gays
try reddit nobody here reads
foucault is a meme here op and for good reason
  basically heideggerian ontology explained through the eyes of an historian of ideas intelligibility and reality as constructed over time through collective discourse and interpretation unlike heidegger though foucaults deespest insights crumble the moment before they materialize in this way hes defs a part of that incessantly maligned tradition of french obscuritanists just read heidegger
  its alright i think his episteme is a little narrow in scope not entirely capturing the underlying epistemological reality as a result it could have encompassed a little more something more akin to kuhns paradigm or even better feyerabends worldview
no its never the fault of the poor
  to be fair shes right
  they deserve their lot in life the poor should fear the rich
  the people who control the economic and political system and design it to benefit themselves and shift the burden elsewhere are not to blame
  as a rich man i completely agree my forefathers being of better stock than the plebs all deserved to inherit our wealth
  not knowing that data can be used to persuade people against their own interest  someone post that paper that talked about manipulating a player emotions such that it puts an ad at just the right time for maximum effectiveness i remember i saw it on /v/      cringe
  all this stuff is basically planned in advance your attempts at seeing an obvious disempowerment of the average worker to seem like a critical thinker is embarrassing
  u dudes are on some no true scotsman ok like if a poor person saves money goes to college gets a useful degree invests and ends up middle class then they arent poor any more so the truth is being poor is a lifestyle choice i work 15 hours a week for 18k a year because im a lazy shit not because some wasp conspiracy is keeping me down
  itt  crying scared of poor colors with guns rushing the gates burning plastic haciendas
  well there is and it is you just happen to also be a lazyfuck the two arent mutually exclusive
  only people who are rich think people are being ripped off somehow every election cycle rich liberals just cant get why poor people vote conservatively its because poor people are honest and know the reason they and their peers are poor is because of dumb decisions and excessive vice thats how you can always tell a rich asshole because they actually believe poor peoples bullshit sob stories
  poor people vote conservatively  poor people usually dont vote coz it is still a work day and they need the money
  no poor people vote conservative people fox news and the republican nominees aggravate their paranoia about the government theyre acomin for your guns they want to ban christmas etc
  as a rich man i completely agree
  only her first case study is valid the next two were a joke and come on using anecdotes as evidence is disingenuous
  this is what nate silver actually believes    wow man lay off the nytimes infographics that shit will rot your brain
  kek okay lil selfhating service drone you know you dont have to turn your emotional pain into ressentiment it certainly isnt doing you any favors
  yeah fuck technology lets bring back corrupt caseworkers
  ahh so the condescending to the working class comes out leftists are like nice guys yo why cant these fucking proles see what nice guys us stalinists are fucking drones why wont you overthrow the current ruling class and put us in power to rule over u instead     believe or not the working class isnt that dumb buddy
  you sound kind of bitter did a democrat not deliver wherever you live
    youre the one calling working class people service drones
  welfare is cancer
  who died and made you the sole representation of the working class
  thats the truth
    no i am  a working class white trash piece of shit i just know a whiner when i hear one desperately in need of some grand reason for the obvious nature of their undesirable working trash class state
  no one is saying that though they are only talking how it is used for shit purposes
  i dont really care about poor people i mean ill give money to a beggar on the street but to the single mom crying on social media about muh inequality i just do not give a shit these people literally go out of their way to make the worst possible decisions despite being told not to do them from the day they are born dont become a druggy dont become addicted to cigarettes dont have underage or at least unprotected sex stay in school and graduate etc etc    where do you find them in their 20s single moms with multiple kids from different fathers wasting every paycheck on cigarettes and tattoos where are the books about these winners the socalled oppressed you faggots jerk off your own morality by claiming to care so much about a group that doesnt even exist when the reality is that the poor you pretend to care about so much has done nothing but engage in selfdestructive behavior and refuses to listen to correction despite having every opportunity to turn their lives around
  youre clearly not working class since you think the working class are conservative because they got tricked by a wasp conspiracy
    you need some story about the honorable nature of dumb poor people knowing their place in the world just to get by pathetic you hold your class back from actually success
  dude i totally would have a stem degree from stanford but mother fucking charles koch and sam walton fucking tricked me into dropping out of high school to smoke weed god damn sneaky wasps always trying to ruin western civilization
  thats what she says in the book
  that doesnt answer my question at all
  u dont get it man youre stuck in a no true scotsman all the poor people who made good decisions and stopped being poor arent poor anymore no one is holding anyone back from anything except poor people with crab in a bucket mentality
  where did she say technology is terrible and we must retrograde
  social mobility in america is really low and decreasing
i work in a copper mine and everyone i work with agrees that we are all worthless cattle who should be killed and eaten by the people god has chosen to lead us
  well one example is where she admits vispdat fufills its extended purpose but wants it gone because it isnt perfect its pretty late so i should go to bed and i dont have the book with me so ill post more examples tomorrow with the page numbers
  no youre retarded for viewing all americans as equal actors moving across a uniform gameboard there are an unfathomable number of gradients of capacity and resources and it is laughable to act so willfully ignorant so as to avoid aspects of existence so obvious
  its but at the same time all these utterly dumb as a box of rocks indians dudes come here bang out some shitty stem degree buy a bunch of rental properties and stack big paperbut they had to take the trouble of going half way across the planet doing a hard degree for 46 years and then taking a risk getting loans to buy property etc meanwhile whiney americans wont get their us up off the farm and come to an area that actually has schools and jobs people in west virginia wont move 4 fucking hours to a state with schools and jobs where they speak the language and have citizenship you have to at least put in some fucking effort no one owes u social mobility
  yeah obviously its easy to start a startup if u went to a private school with a bunch of other tech bros who end up with stem phds and your parents can all angel invest in your shit but there are a lot of ways to make money in america beyond these selfpromoting silicon valley tech hucksters
  hiney americans wont get their us up off the farm and come to an area that actually has schools and jobs  maybe coz they are too poor to do it the indians you talk about are much more wealthier to afford such luxuries like uppermiddle class at least
  sorry if you cant even figure out how to move to the nearest city then you probably dont deserve to have a lot of resources at your disposal i see nothing wrong with this
    gradients of capacity  yeah  like intelligence retard oh yeah and literacy retard   you retard
  ironic coming from the person who insists that other people are looking down on the working class
  but the working class admit this thats why they dont hate the rich only middle class people who feel like their ruling class aspirations have been stifled are angry at the rich and try to find another route to the upper echelons of the ruling class by leading a revolution being mad about rich people is literally the most middle class thing possible u disgust me
  but the working class admit this  like who    try to find another route to the upper echelons of the ruling class by leading a revolution  ironic considering that revolutionary groups came from working class which is unique in america    and i am not middle class 
  iww    fakest union known to man you are middle class as shit u fool no one
  jacobian of mental disability  actually great but otherwise whered you get chiefly you mendicant of maxillary masturbation
  the union created by working class leaders like haywood and debs and advocate one big union is a fake union  now you are just projecting senpai
  middle class detected      communists literally live under a grand delusion that the working class are receptive to their ideas    top fucking kek
    how can do you weigh those variables  how do you know retard  you dont
  iww arent communist and is created and led by the working class though
proles would fucking love automation a reason to literally fucking do nothing thinking everyone is going to become le super educated super people with whatever mandated education is overly wishful thinking
  the iww is a meme let me just stop you and tell you im already aware of its history the unionized workers of pennsylvania are forever more relevant than iww and they arent because inions are finished in the global market
  whether or not it is a meme doesnt undermine what was already said about it though     also unions are finished in the global market precisely coz iww was broken before a international union could form 
  unions are leftover artifacts from the european guild system a global universal was just never going to happen and as europeans dwindle as a percentage of the global population it shouldnt be a shocker that european trade guilds are declining
  i mean ill give money to a beggar on the street  good job funding that beggars drug addict with your money
  trade unions exist elsewhere from the west though so the legacy is still there    global universal was just never going to happen  debatable perhaps if the obu took flight
  most of them were state sanctioned by communist parties or based about an ethnic group
  like those in sa even mine in my country isnt those things you said it is neither in the west or sa btw
  or we can eat the rich lmao
ltv  true  lmao pick one
  your forefathers were likely manipulative cunts who exploited the sedentary lives of families whose own ancestors laid the foundations of civilzation     bbbut being manipulative means they were really smart    maybe but it also means they were jews tess of durbervilles was not meant to be fictional
  i agree with this my family is loaded and are generally higher quality people than the poor ones ive met growing up    almost every single poor person ive met was just overall shitty human being   dumb  selfish  cruel    they are all the same sorry lot and i cant wait until automation forces the powers that be to wipe them all out
  where are the books about these winners the socalled oppressed  the dm likes to go on about them
  no empathy at all for your fellow man you would be the same as the people you describe if you werent born into your current family
  whats her problem
  dumb  selfish  cruel  you have the same traits though
  its easy to be high quality when you dont have to spend half your time wound up in the struggle for existence    i grew up poor and i have more integrity and moral fiber than the majority or rich people ive come across you need exposure to really have sympathy for the poor
  dumb  nope graduated from hs with all honors and currently in college  selfish  hardly  ive donated clothes and shoes i no longer need to the needy several times  cruel  how exactly am i cruel   for believing that poor people are all mostly low life scum that should be erased from the face of the earth
just become rich lol
the poor and the rich are mostly the same people at different stages of their lives if you are born poor the chances of you remaining poor are actually very low  and the more capitalistic the society the more this is true
  lol just be born rich guys   real fucking smart asshat its not technology but it is indeed unfair as lobbying is still around to bribe politicians
  graduating from high school with honors  what does that even mean why do americans care about high school so much
  if you are born poor the chances of you remaining poor are actually very low  ehhhh
  ehhhh  good argument  getting into the top 1 is very unlikely but if youre born into a family in the lowest 10 of household income the chances of remaining in the bottom 50 your whole life is very low too lazy to look up the actual stats but its one of those things that you dont think would be the case because of all the envy propaganda going around     also if im doing alright financially and theres jeff bezos who has 1000000x more money than me why the fuck would i care besides he got rich from providing a valuble service that i pay for even when he dies and his children inherit his wealth why should that be a problem inheritence is a legitimate form of wealth in short income inequality is just a nonissue
  fine then let me make an argument    poverty changes you if you grow up poor it actually warps your development youre less trusting of others more standoffish suffer from anxiety its why ghetto blacks are such assholes sometimes    im as someone who slept on a bed roll and had to forage for food as a kid    furthermore poverty becomes a trap you may be more likely to face addiction because you have more reasons to selfmedicate furthering your poverty conservatives blame you for your poor decision making but they dont see the other side of the coin    this article is interesting because the man who wrote it is actually a successful financier now but he delves into the neurobiology of poverty and how it affects your brain    
  the people who control the economic and political system are never compromised of the formerly poor  retard alert if the poor werent responsible for themselves there wouldnt be such tremendous potential for social mobility
  im as someone  im speaking as someone
  im a first generation immigrant and make more money than 99 of the us this is pure bullshit my family lived on welfare from since i was a child to when i finished college theres plenty of help for those in poverty the difference is not all of them choose to help themselves
  furthermore poverty becomes a trap you may be more likely to face addiction because you have more reasons to selfmedicate furthering your poverty conservatives blame you for your poor decision making but they dont see the other side of the coin  how is it not deserving of blame reminds me of the retards who think just because all of our actions are reducible to chemical reactions in the brain they somehow arent ours youve described the process not discredited you are those chemical reactions
  standoffish  now new evidence is emerging suggesting the changes can go even deeperto how our bodies assemble themselves shifting the types of cells that they are made from and maybe even how our genetic code is expressed playing with it like a rubiks cube thrown into a running washing machine if this science holds up it means that poverty is more than just a socioeconomic condition it is a collection of related symptoms that are preventable treatableand even inheritable in other words the effects of poverty begin to look very much like the symptoms of a disease  shiiiiiiiiit
  alcholism is a disease  even poverty is a disease  homosexuality no thats just who you are  i hate leftists so much
  the cure  gibs
  technology is against the poor  every poor person owns an iphone which they bought on lease which they pay by mortgaging the house their grandparents left them and will renew when the next and newest version of the iphone comes out
a model that has no degree of predictive abilityits chances of being right are about the same as the chances of guessing heads or tails in a coin tosswould have a 50 percent fit under the roc curve the afsts initial fit in the area under the roc curve is 76 percent about the same as the predictive accuracy of a yearly mammogram  seventysix percent might sound pretty good but its only halfway between a coin toss and perfect prediction  in 2016 there were 15139 reports of abuse and neglect in allegheny county at its current rate of accuracy the afst would have produced 3633 incorrect predictions  11506 correct predictions but no muh oppressed poor people what a stupid cunt
on my walks around the neighborhood i have been touched by the kindness and courage ive witnessed a bible laid on a neatly madeup sleeping bag inside a red tent the affirmation let gratitude be your attitude written in black magic marker inside a makeshift shelter on gladys avenue ive had fascinating conversations on its street corners and been kindly chaperoned to the bus stop after dark by generous souls who then returned to sleep on the sidewalk ive also been threatened by hustlers and knuckleheads fondled harassed and followed by men muttering offers of drugs or dick  dick dick dick
its so real down here i find more love here than i have anywhere in the city as down and out as people are theyll stop and talk to you shake your hand my tour guide skid row human rights defender general dogon finished tcs thought on the other side of main street theyll pass you like you a telephone pole  a fucking stereotype played straight
  poverty is an obstacle that either toughens you or breaks you i never said that poverty was a good thing or that it was easy to overcome just that most people actually do overcome it my problem is that when people talk about how bad poverty is and it is bad the solution they come up with is always more of a social welfare state more wealth redistribution higher taxes more restrictions and regulations on businesses or even socialism etc the thing is these are all great ways to increase poverty not to reduce it yes poverty is bad but it is less bad under a capitalist system because you can actually do something about it also and i cant state this enough income inequality is not a problem
  shes a slut who cant keep her legs closed
whats wrong with profiling policing and punishing poor people one big reason that poor peoples lives are bad is crime committed in most cases by other poor people whose victims are also poor it would seem obvious that punishing this behavior would make poor peoples lives better by reducing crime some people need more force to keep them on good behavior than others

filthy peasants should get down on their knees and praise god that they are even suffered to live if their lives were 1/100 as bad as you imbeciles think theyd all have done the world a favor and killed themselves long ago
poor people are largely to blame for their actions and the positions they are in due to bad spending habits and impulse mentality
   but dey dont know no betta    buys a funko pop

intellectual elite here i mean true intellectual elite not just rich assholes but top percentile for intelligence studying mathematics  were going to destroy all brainlets soon rich poor makes no difference if you fall beneath the 85 for iq youre done for in the next 20 years
          jean paul get the tumbrel
i think it is pretty ironic poor people despise the wealthy and elite classes but the poor people love imitating a false sense of being classy on social media
  nope graduated from hs with all honors and currently in college  is graduating hs seen as some impressive accomplishment in america    ive donated clothes and shoes i no longer need to the needy several times  donating things you dont want doesnt make you selfless or generous dumbass    how exactly am i cruel   for believing that poor people are all mostly low life scum that should be erased from the face of the earth  yes    this has to be bait
  32  what
  its nobodys fault  but there is such a thing as consequence  such is life  youre a true idiot if you dont think youd likely be victim to the same pitfalls be my guest in not giving a shit about poor people but dont fucking kid yourself as if youre so deserving and most of this isnt just a toss in the dark as if the dumb you had any hand in how your development and behavioural framework occurred    i fucking wish you better not be lying to me    the extravagant rich are the same people just a different turn of fortune people that have never been properly taught how to manage resources one by lack and the other by excess    ye poverty is self reciprocating self replicating i dont mean black people the environment that breeds the nigger boils down to constant presence of anxiety structural volatility in an environment by which there are no other means to exert influence assholery wins as this guy says  spreading the wealth doesnt fix this when certain things get codified in epigenetic expression    of course those are their own actions whats distasteful is how one can levy such disdain at people who cant feasibly correct themselves asking a guy to pick between vanilla and chocolate ice cream when hes never had ice cream    thats been an enduring worry of mine technology is rampaging past our meaty grasp our ethics cant handle it
   course those are their own actions whats distasteful is how one can levy such disdain at people who cant feasibly correct themselves  what proof do you have they cant correct themselves not everyone who is poor remains poor thats proof youre wrong as a general rule
  ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
    all evidence suggests that welfare only makes things worse
  muh probabilties and statistics are totally infallible and not extracted from practices prone to discrimination
  the whole point is to discriminate you imbecile
  holy shit is this literally how retarded the upper middle class is    they throw out some token gestures and assume theyre christ    yes this is exactly how they are they are low class scum that complied with the jews new order and got paid     their main job is not their business not the task that theyre ostensibly paid for but to take up space so real people cant ascend  the subhuman wall to pen in humanity so it can be destroyed for the insane lusts of the jew    troll imo

  im poor and i havent missed an election in 10 years there are scheduling options where i live

  good decisions  how can you make a good decision when your economic success is tied to your spiritual destruction    participating in this economy is literally suicidal genocidal    you think you have all these good reasons that there is no choice but you could never argue it you could never connect the dots    the only logical choice is subsistence and revolution
  oh burgers never change
  why are trans people poor when they have an average 120 iq
    it means i graduated within the upper percentile compared to other students you utter morons  and i went to a private tech school where you would be kicked out if your grades didnt meet the standard also to keep dumb poor kids from attending there was a yearly fee you needed to pay    i dont consider myself middle class but thats probably what we are categorized as these days to hide the fact that the real middle class is disappearing both my parents income exceeds over 300k
let me get this right    lower middle classdyslexia  working classadhd

  trans people arent poor a ton of them work at google and other silicon valley outfits they get affirmative action as women and cant ever get a bad performance review or its transphobia they cant lose
  this but unironically
  statistics say otherwise
  post ur sources being trans is a privilege what could be more middle class than demanding that your parents pay to change your gender
  trans people come from upper/middle class backgrounds but because theyre mentally ill they end up blowing all their money on a trip to thailand for underground sex surgery and end up homeless
  maybe 20 years ago now they work in tech those companies are so desperate for female workers theyll hire a chick with a dick to make quota
  
why are there poor people in the first place
  some people are slothful while others are industrious
  drugs
  poor people dont vote conservative  this retarded falsity is only found in the minority of rich liberals that cant understand that the poor dont vote 100 commie but only 75
  yeah but isnt starvation something that can be easily avoided in a developed country
  not sure what you mean by this richer people have more means and connections to increase their political weight compared to their demography
  thats a notable lack of selfawareness
  it is already avoided in all developed countries us not included of course
  what i mean is nobody works 60 hours a week making minimum wage to read about politics on their day off
  mate barely anyone who makes min wage is full time
how come intellectuals cant realize the only reason rich people exist is because the poor exist    success and wealth is utterly relative poor people have more luxuries today than royalty of the past yet still feel bad are unhappy are dysfunctional etc why because theyre only poor in the context of the environment theyre in theyre poor relative to the rich    in other words without failure you cant have success if nobody was poor then nobody would be rich nobody would be successful the pursuit of equality and fixing success/wage disparity is utterly futile and will only ever shift misery not cure it
itt poor commies getting frustrated to see that rich people are better than they are    hahahaha if youre poor in america that means you are dumb with money case closed
didnt realize this was such a heated topic
the welfare state is only legitimate in a homogenous society  the poor in diverse societies should and will be put out of their misery
  it is avoided in the us i do work at the salvation army every weekend in an extremely poor section of an eastern appalachian state we give them a massive 3 course lunch midday every day for whoever comes and guess what since the early 10s numbers have gone from 70 to like 12 and those are all old people and we are not the only place in town even the supermarkets give out their loss stuff to the poor to say nothing of the catholics and such unemployment is at 3    im not saying that there arent true morons out west that have moved away from all possible support and are actively starving their children through neglect but whereever there is a population there is a church willing to help desu the great crisis of the american lower class is heroin and fentanyl and meth not fucking starvation
  for real tho
  we need to have this happen again but the reverse for poor people
dont make shitty commitments and dont have a shitty spending mentality you wont be poor then poor people skip two car payments and you get back on your feet real damn quick either that or go work a lot more than you do now both for maximum moneygrubbing    cant afford kids   dont have them and realize that they exist to be a 18yearminimum money sink  cant afford that new car   dont buy it and go look for a used one   cant afford the rent for those luxury apartments   dont live there and go lower your living standards
commies btfo
yikes
the poorfag is truly the essence of /lit/ boorish psuedish yet wellread and with a heart of gold
    america has some of the worse economic and social mobility in the world
  my dad even works all weekends but he still lives in his own shit personally i think its because hes a pathologically altruistic dickless wonder
  if you spent your whole life working 50 hours a week for minimum wage you must be pretty fuckin dumb
  minimum wage work is childishly simple it is absolutely not hard work
  that was not your premise
  dude 90 of minimum wage jobs are part time so they dont have to pay for healthcare under obamacare the changes of even getting a job that pay minimum wage with 50 hours a week of hours would be unlikely not to mention mandatory time and a half overtime past 40 hours means its not really minimum wage but no place that pays minimum wage is gonna push their workers into overtime so as i suspected you have no clue about the working class you are some middle class failure who tries to make up for your inability to climb socially with faux concern for working stiffs spare us
  make no mistake its an entirely mutual relationship the wealthy despise the poor and the ressentiment fueling this mimetic cycle starts at the top
  poor people dont despite the rich the middle class despises the rich which is why you despite the rich and dont understand why the poor support trump
  poor people dont despite the rich the middle class despises the rich  
  have you ever met a poor person they dont give a shit about the rich its only middle class people whose envy of the rich turns to hate
this thread has further convinced me that everybody on /lit/ except myself is an out of touch fuckwit
  same
  why
  poor people either dont vote or vote according to whatever culture war concern is currently getting them hard
  poor people would literally kill you if there was no police to protect you from them
  jeff bezos descendants should have to pay an estate tax the size of a small countrys gdp
  poor people literally kill each other everyday and there are police
  yeah i went to a college that is shitty tier not even top 50 public school but its main claim to fame is being top ten for social mobility but of course its all full of indians and chinese americans arent interested in bettering themselves for the most part
  also worth noting amazon is a public company if youre not a retard you bought a bunch of shares and shared in the prosperity it createdyou do own amzn shares right
  he thinks the rich wouldnt just pay the mob for protection    dream on nerd
  1 of the global population presently owns 48 of the worlds wealth in a world where some are starving to death it is seemingly fine and fitting that others have more money than they could ever rationally spend in 100 lifetimes this is in no way normal or simply part of the richpoor tradeoff this is simply criminal and a system which cannot eradicate itself the elites create familial empires with themselves on top and few outside of them will ever join their ranks such as the rare entrepreneurs who made it big in the modern tech era but the rest of the world especially the third world are literally born into slavery to these elites a bondage which they never had the chance to break out from id be fine with a world that had some basic level of pooraveragerich wherein all groups could still live comfortably and not barely survive but the current system we live under is simply criminal and i dont imagine income inequality has ever been so wide at any point in our previous history     add that to the population level being higher than ever before and you have the highest number of extremely poor people there has ever been alongside the highest hoarding of wealth among the smallest population of individuals that we have so far seen    nobody needs to be as rich as the richest of our world are  nobody 48 of the wealth belongs to them i mean what a number half the wealth is held by 1 of the population and if we believe that the rothschilds and other groups dont disclose their true levels of wealth to the ones doing the census then the disparity is even higher     it is a sin and god will punish the rich for the system theyve created
reading nonfiction    hahahaha wow good job moron
  the rothschilds havent been relevant in ages their last hurrah was some loans during the american civil war those huge banking dynasties only existed because capitalist economies didnt have central banks established yet so they had to turn to rothschilds and jp morgan for state level debt the fact that you are so clueless about who is actually rich means you probably shouldnt be trying to plan out the global economy for us ok kid maybe get a job and plan your own household economy first
  congratulations on being born rich im sure you have many moving stories to tell about the experience
  also if im doing alright financially and theres jeff bezos who has 1000000x more money than me why the fuck would i care    because capital being the allpowerful signifier controls every aspect of existence if bezos and others used their wealth to buy property luxury goods a dozen yachts whatever  thats fine economists would even argue its a good thing theyre investing in the economy theyre creating wealth money is ultimately entering circulation and not being hoarded but thats not exactly what the plutocrats are spending their money on now is it brute base materialism is boring who gives a shit about owning an entire fleet of yachts anymore that kind of showy bourgeois culture is so passe and last century plutocrats buy out politicians they buy out nations they fund ngos and revolutions to destabilize governments they can short your entire economy and force you into a recession through pure economic speculation thats power no private individual or organization should ever have     but that has always been the case hasnt it
  short an entire economy    dude the british mismanaged their currency fuck george soros but he didnt crash the pound he just correctly estimated that the british government was fuckin up and would have to devalue the people that rage the most against capitalism have the least clue it seems
  own 167 banking institutions across the planet  one of the 13 illuminati bloodlines  not relevant    if you say so
  bernie can still win
  illuminati conspiracy shit    oh i thought i was dealing with a teenage communist not a boomer conspiracy nut take it to the alex jones website wanker
  im not against capitalism per se i just think the system could work better if certain elements were exorcised and i think most capitalists would agree with me risk aversity the hoarding of wealth corporatist intermingling of private and public institutions  all things unconducive to a healthy economy
  we need this to happen again but for literally 90 of the human race and nearly all of the top 1 earners    kill yourself
  donated clothes and shoes i no longer need to the needy  thats not selfless at all anon thats getting rid of crap you dont want in a conveniently charitable way selflessness requires sacrifice prioritizing oneself below others something like volunteering time which isnt as easily given away as excess wealth at a soup kitchen or some sort of community program would be a good start if done for the purpose of helping those needy rather than for appearances    a poor man giving away a pair of shoes when he only has one ratty pair is a selfless act someone who has plenty of pairs of shoes giving away a bag of ones they dont need/want to the salvation army is an empty gesture
    hoarding of wealth  opinion discarded how do people hoard wealth exactly keep it under their mattress   no they invest it which is actually good for economic growth
  no they shouldnt that money has already been taxed you cant give a moral argument for taxing it again just because the person who owned it died
  shared in the prosperity it created  no i dont own shares but i already have shared in the prosperity by using the service i have bought cheaper products from amazon with more convenience than was offered by other retailers
  yeah they invest it in foreign shell companies lmao
some of you guys are idiots i was born dirt poor and am now an educated white collar worker with a passport let me tell you some things  when youre born poor you need to claw your way out of that shit its a herculean effort to escape poverty the vast majority who are born into the lower class make the exact same mistakes as their parents and peers you have to understand most of the lower class are from broken homes this seriously screws with your psychology its like looking up at the world from the bottom of a swamp now you have this kid whose parents emotionally abused him since he can remember who can barely function in life and knows nothing about the outside world competing with some pampered middle class kid who is mentally sound healthy has seen the world has good role models has been taught things and spoken to like a human being who can function socially youre asking the poor kid to compete with that kids from the lower classes have those dead looking eyes because theyve lived through a daily hell youre wondering why they cant just magically become mentally healthy learn things no one ever taught them and compete with some kid from a loving household who has received care and education   so assuming a miracle like my case was maybe the poor kid from the broken home can manage to crawl out of the gutter they poke their head up and a whole slew of new challenges faces them student loans college choice career paths office relations interviews what the fuck is business casual and how do you buy nice clothes they have no role models they cant ask their family no one in their family has ever even looked at a college campus or applied for a job that wasnt kitchen work or hauling garbage the kid from the middle class family receives tons of amazing intelligent advice from his family and peers the poor kid is on his own  you are set for failure from the beginning at every single step every challenge every obstacle every question the middle class or rich kid may as well have a cheat sheet in his pocket and the poor kid is reading it like this shit is written in another language  you say bad choices and warned from early childhood against stupid shit but you guys dont understand that bad choices and stupid shit are the norm for them and no one ever told them its wrong   kids from a nonbroken home have a constant lifelong overwhelming advantage in every single category over someone from a broken home and this is indelible if if the poor kid can somehow come up with all the answers on his own he can succeed otherwise he gets dragged back into the slum
  now the real kicker about this situation is that it is a systemic lifelong advantage on the side of the middle class and wealthy if they make a mistake they have a safety net the poor kid has no net they fuck up even once and theyre done its back to the ghetto they may not have the fortitude to keep fighting like a caged animal just to achieve a normalcy that everyone else is simply handed being in that state is exhausting mentally and physically exhausting imagine you ask two people to run a mile one has just run a marathon and is barely standing the other has just woken up from good sleep and had a healthy breakfast but they have an equal ordeal youre being insincere or outright stupid   the thing is that nothing will ever fix this there is no cure for the inequality caused by having shitty parents versus good parents how do you propose we fix that foster care is even worse its a rape cave the only way we could achieve equality is by the state taking all infants away at birth or really if all infants were born in tubes because the mothers choices while pregnant have a world of consequence on development and having the state raise all the children even then youd still have residual inequality from genetic drift by the castes   the injustice is that this problem cannot be reasonably fixed there is no simple answer there is no single cause of derailment no single point in time where intervention will fix it even if you take away all the poor kids and raise them in a boarding school they will still be missing that warm loving familial environment nothing can replace that  yes its unequal and it is so in a way that can never be fixed and there is no easy cure for it even if you have the rare success case that child will still carry scars the rest of his life its a constant weight every time you look behind your shoulder theres a shadow there following you waiting to drag you back that is mentally exhausting   to say its muh raycism or such is completely missing the heart of the issue if your roof was leaking all over and you put a bucket under the biggest leaks and call it solved such as racebased reparations are your roof will cave in from rot youre looking at the symptoms and not the causes and again you cant institute any law that can fix shitty parenting
  ive donated clothes and shoes i no longer need to the needy several times  pfft at least donate money to some vague cause or charity for that sense of entitlement holy shit
  good post glad to see at least one person on /lit/ isnt the definitional sheltered middleuppermiddle class brainlet
    you have to remember a lot of poor people have kids because of whatever government benefits you could receive from them at least here in the uk you couldve basically gotten a free council house years ago if you were a younger parent from a poor background but i think has all changed now
can we just have the fucking class war already  i want the rich to win just so all the petite bourgeois who bumbled their way into moderate wealth through family connections and systematic graft get absolutely fucked by the real capitalists
    this is true upper middle class and higher kids especially have a totally different habitus from low class people that subtly teaches them from birth to be an acceptable human being and jump through all the hoops of things like business networking or the ivory tower    but there is a fix its called breaking up oligarchies and making success in society as tiered as possible with halfdecent social safety nets so that everybody is virtually guaranteed a college education and feels plugged in to civic participation stop rich people from monopolising institutions and twisting them to be special clubs for more rich people by obliterating the rich people if you need to     europe has a much higher class porosity than the us for this reason much more intergenerational mobility between classes because there is less of a guarantee there that wealth automatically means you will stay wealthy and poverty likewise means you will stay poor there hints of potential from lower class people are more readily seized upon and cultivated and those people can more easily climb the ranks and become indistinguishable from the polished rich kids likewise if you fuck up as a rich kid in state institutions you fuck up its possible to become a mediocrity despite being born to a notable     a real aristocracy is meritocratic oligarchs and plutocrats are a massive cancer on any society anyone who lives better than the average citizen simply by virtue of being born to a certain family needs to be brutally removed from society before the problem can metastasize
  in the uk there are no end of people working minimum wage jobs full time even more who work about 1 over minimum wage full time
what books to read  to help me understand marxism
try working is hard and the government should just give me free shit by starchild progroessocuck
marxs concept of man by erich fromm
every day a thread like this crops up
how do i understand how 225  theres nothing there to understand everyone who says they understand it is lying because they know whoever theyre talking to doesnt understand it either and cant call them out
    i knew there was going to be some edgelord replies like this i didnt say i was pro marxist did i i just want to understand the concept
  capital
hegel
engels socialism utopian and scientific  engels ludwig feuerbach and the end of classical german philosophy  me  the german ideology  marx  capital  marx  critique of the gotha programme
lol he was eating jelly beans now hes gotta hide them because he doesnt want to share
read anything by sorel
  its edgy not to support an ideology that has failed in its every incarnation and resulted in the deaths of billions of people  really makes me think
  karl marx and the close of his system eugen bohm von brawerk
is there a similar list for accelerationism
  muh gorillions  persuasive argument my dear chap
  just watch texhnolyze
  ironic that under communism the freeloaders are forced to labor for their scraps meanwhile in capitalism due to overabundance they enjoy neetdom under the welfare system
anon read this book if you can find a copyit outlines all of marxs theories in plain english and categorizes all of the aspects of his thought so you get a full picture the guy who writes it includes support and criticisms on both sides and i found that it helped me understand the questions i should be asking when i moved on to marxs firsthand works the marxengels reader by tucker is the best compilation of important marx and engels works
  yeah id rather this thread was about fascism  now thats a based ideology
  this is a good list op but not all are great for beginners socialism utopian and scientific and the german ideology are the best to start with dont bother with the manifesto honestly it was a contemporary political pamphlet and lacks a lot of the good nuance and scholarship their other works have
  if you knew history youd understand without that shitty welfare system and laws about labour and all these socialist ideas the ruling class just abuses everyone and destroys the county happened until unions came there is balance to everything in life there is never one system balance is key
  solzhenitsyns gulag archipelago
  dont bother with the manifesto  i disagree its his sales pitch to the workers of the world the proletariat in the most simplistic form telling them to unite it may be lacking in theory be a little bit too simplistic and even have generalizations of the working class unable to hold up but it is important because it shows how he attempted to convey and connect his theory to the agents of revolution the proletariat   it is a useful read because it is intended for even the most basic reader to for the most part grasp and also how you try to boil your ideas down into the most simple form is a good indicator of how someone actually thought in a larger sense
this does make me curious  anyone know what a soviet school curriculum looked like in regards to teaching marxist leninism  what was considered required reading
  i think the consequence of neets existing has more to do with comfort being the main selling point of wealth than it does the existence of welfare
  neets existing are simply a consequence of a certain part of the population not being able to provide useful labor or having the incentive to change their status
  what is the incentive to wealth if youre born into comfort
  has never read marx and bases entire belief system on memes
  meanwhile the labour laws in the glorious socialist republic democratic nation of peace that is north korean are so great they literally want to work for free    those evil capitalist nations with their goddamn unions baka
  your only recourse to the idea that capitalism exploits labor is to name a despotic shithole labor conditions in almost every capitalist country are dogshit but most critique doesnt just play the name game it engages the systems of capital at scale im guessing though that even if you did ever read any leftist theory youre too dense to respond in kind    read a book and stop being such a dipshit
welcome my son    welcome to the machine
  gets upset about memes  yikes
  thinking im upset when im actually super fucking chill and the most not giving a fuck guy youd ever meet if you were even man enough to meet me in person pussy bitch  yikes
  your only recourse to the idea that capitalism exploits labor is to name a despotic shithole  not my fault every ideal socialist nation that adheres to marxist theories wholeheartedly ends up a despotic shithole     labor conditions in almost every capitalist country are dogshit  yet its far superior than any socialist state past or present this is a well known fact unionism has its home in capitalism
  this whole cringy af post
  socialism isnt moderate capitalism with a happy face you cretin
why do otherwise wellread people turn into total retards whenever someone mentions marx its honestly the most validating experience when youre a commie literally everyone else spergs out without reading any theory whatsoever i engaged with classical conservatism for a long time before putting it aside very fishy how the reverse isnt true
  based
  yikes
basic economics by sowell if you want to understand why it doesnt work

  leftism eternally btfo how will the left ever recover
  the white man fears the ashkenazi intellect
  
  hey i made that years ago needs lots of reworking
  fair enough my worry is only that its treated as a theoretical work when it really isnt outside of some crude summaries so if people go in expecting a good solid primer on marxism theyre going to take away something more simplistic than they should it is a nice read though

  hi dad
  killing rich people is bad but executing kikes and niggers is ok  nice try stormdit
  only good post so far
  peter singers a very short introduction to marx does a nice job
  fpbp
  capital if youre full force or just something like the marxengels reader for an idea theres also who archives for socialist writing if you just search for it those have marx and basically everyone else
  agreed ga cohens book on marxs theory of history and allen woods book on marx in general thereafter
  they want to know what we think about the bad man
  but enough about capitalism this is a marxism thread
  marxs three main influences were  a hegel  heres where he got the philosophical foundation for historical materialism marxs view of nature is kind of like hegels path of the evolution of spirit towards reason stripped of all mysticism mindbody separation and viewing the aufhebung as the result of human agents decisions against one another in the struggle for the working classes search for freedom  b classical economists like adam smith and david ricardo capital a critique of political economy is mostly just what its title says it offers very little in terms of constructive economic models except as a way of claiming that the capitalist economic system will eventually collapse under its own weight  c utopian socialists like charles fourier henri de saintsimon and pierre joseph proudhon  he also took influence from his former fellow lefthegelians stirner bauer feuerbach whom he greatly criticized for being too close to hegel plato aristotle epicurus whom he wrote his phd thesis about thomas malthus and jeanjacques rousseau    i read marxs theses on feuerbach the 18th brumaire of louis napoleon parts of the german ideology and capital volume i during my freshman year in college without getting too deep into any of marxs influences except for stirner and hegel and i understood marx well enough    id suggest you to start with theses on feuerbach continue with the manifesto of the communist party follow that up with the german ideology the original work is 800 pgs long but theres a 50ish page long version on marxistsorg get a taste for something slightly different with wage labor and capital and finish off with das kapital probably not the whole thing but at least some of the most important excerpts on lvt commodity fetishism and alienation  alternatively get yourself a used copy of the marxengels reader  if possible borrow it from the library if not steal it from somebody else or download some pdfs of the original texts onto your computer or cellphone so as to not perpetuate the cycle of endless consumption of goods
  agreed post more books guys
  starve you entire country  but anon the biggest increase in life expectancy ever occurred in the ussr after socialism though russia did suffer the biggest drop off ever after adopting privatization plus the famines that did happen were a cause of rapid industrialization not just because socialism makes food evaporate japan had similar incidents throughout its advancement to the modern era and even then things werent really solved until massive support from the usa not to mention what happened to the colonies forced to industrialize like india        
  theres so much doublethink in this post the improvement in life expectancy during the ussr was seen all over the world and is due to industrialization the switch to privatization being so painful for russia had nothing to due with privatization it has more to do with it being the aftermath of the soviet house of cards collapsing no one living in a communist country wanted it anymore the contradictions inherent to it accumulated to critical mass in the late 80s early 90s japans incidents during industrialization were mostly natural disasters which have nothing to do with ideology like earthquakes    the sheer absurdity pointlessness and damage of the ussrs existence can be made apparent to a kindergartener its only people who are lured by marxs rhetoric the historical passion of the revolutionaries and archived communist propaganda who think it can be viable even if the current vogue is to harness woke capital to subvert western culture woke capital is still capitalism theres a reason why the modern marxist movement is led by a literal orgy of gay transvestites fascism which does have future actually appears to be telling the truth

  marxism does not work  i suggest you read wealth of nations by adam smith and also capitalism  freedom by milon friedman

im trying to write epic fantasy i wrote a 56k word draft then put it on the shelf then i did nanowrimo sucessfully and learned a lot about writing so now im rewriting the fantasy novel i would like an opinion of my first chapter ive really expanded it what im posting here is really just the beginning of it     there is a short prolouge where some cult members talk of the burning champion who will stop the coming calamity then we cut to our simple farm boy heres what i got         i really wanted to show that our hero braun is a young boy who hates his simple farm life and lusts for adventure im really immersing myself in his life right now and i want to know if this is boring i think the characters are interesting enough would really like some feed back right now i think this chapter is halfway done it ends with him finding a magic sword but im not there yet in this    what do you think
cant help you but ill give you a bump as i watch this thread it may be relevant to me soon
epic fantasy  back to /sffg/
sounds generic as fuck
this is riddled with typos and repetition the bitch smiles and looks at her son talks then smiles and looks at her son in the same fucking paragraph
imagines all scenery characters and fight scenes in very good detail  cant recall a single word  do you know this feel
  i dont even remember what post im responding to half the time
  its called being a zoomer who minimized his attention span through a decade of dopaminenewsbitestyleinternetbrowsing    that or you just have shitty verbal iq
should i read kant
  read him alongside a commentary a lot of shitfags misunderstand and misrepresent his ideas in the modern day check out hegel too
no its all very boring you should get a job instead
  read the critiques sexual abstinence cerebrolysin and coffee for massive cognitive kant gains
  i dunno kant you
    no you should just read schopenhauer and joseph campbell
  short answer yes    long answer yes but start with some general introductions aaron apish has a fantastic introduction called the appeal of kant that really peels back the layers of his philosophy and divides it into consumable chunks by tracing the trajectory of his work alongside kants obsession with bananas when you clear all the excess roughage away his argument is easily picked pleasant to internalize and very digestible the necessity of the possibility of synthetic apriori judgements and how kant proves this slaps even the most novice reader in the face with the force of shit flung from the hands of an excited orangutan a lot of intro accounts of kant are so dull youll feel like they were written by legitimate vegetables get apishs version and study it i promise its pretty sweet
  this   get a job find a nice lady propose to her start a family once you secured your offsprings future you can read kant
  8/10
  lol no kant is for pseuds and coping religitards who want to larp as philosophers i see hegel or kant know not to take that person seriously
  cringe
literally why would you want to kant is a famously terrible writer his philosophy is better understood through secondary texts
  c r i n g e
  what the fuck is your problem faggot philosophy is read for ideas if the philosopher himself is brilliant yet austitic and terrible and translating those ideas its a sensible choice to get these ideas from someone who waded through the autism and made it palatable no
  no    especially with kant kant is a clear and lucid writer philosophy has to be rigorous and kant is just that not an autist but a philosopher maybe both now when i read kant i think i understand something really clearly i look up secondary literature and the same paragraph which i thought was clear seems to be interpreted in 10 different ways by scholars of kant who have spent years reading over and over again so secondary literature if you have no background to agree or disagree with it is useless in the case of kant    maybe philosophy is read for ideas buy ideas are expressed in a specific format by a specific person and interpretative difficulties and influences are found in the core text much like people here recommend the inaccurate and often difficult kjv for its influence but maybe even more important
  i love his writing personally you just need a good working memory to be able to read him a useful advice is to make a mental image of his ideas as you read his work
  kant is clear and lucid  there is no consensus mong kant experts about what any passage means     lol    also secondary literature on kant is useless just come up with your own even more far fetched interpretation of him to add to the 500 conflicting interpretations of experts
  i tried to explain the seeming lucidity for me in relation to the lack of consensus    you can either give up on philosophy or understanding kant or you can sort secondary literature by also having read kant and seeing what seems most reasonable to you you will never achieve perfect unity between your understanding kant and what he was trying to say but interpretation asks that you at least try
  i guess youre just a lot smarter than all his devotees with phds     i think his for most people unarguable obscurity is a feature not a bug theres a reason hes in massive disrepute among philosophers no one takes him seriously anymore because he did next to nothing of philosophical importance all he did was introduce jargony impenetrability into philosophy few people outside of france appreciate him for that
  hes in massive disrepute among philosophers no one takes him seriously anymore because he did next to nothing of philosophical importance    sorry babe but you are just dumb    check out strawsons bounds of sense to see that analytic ie anglo philosophy also loves kant or more recently someone like conant kant is a classic for good reason babe i do find it strange admittedly that his absolutely horrible moral philosophy is more popular and consequently less understood
yeah but its rough try reading beisers books alongside him and generally taking a while to immerse yourself in the lingo all philosophy after kant is a series of footnotes to kant so the more you understand him the more you will understand subsequent developments its hard to overstate his importance or impact kant is the threshold of early modern and modern philosophy and the dawn of true selfconsciousness and reflexivity in philosophy as well as the most foundational philosopher of science of the modern era if he isnt looming in the background of whatever 19th20th century philosopher youre reading then someone like schelling is someone whose own entire oeuvre was written in the shadow of kant     the best secondary writings on kant will be historical and hermeneutic in nature like beiser contextualising his ideas and language try to avoid analytics appropriating him sellars has unusually good stuff on kant though i have to say
  kant is not early modern descartes is modern kant is the enlightenment thinker    and kant is not self reflexive in fact his lack of reflexivity is what gave birth to idealism fichte and possibly even post modernity foucault deleuze etc
  strawson expressly disavowed that period of his work referring to his engagement with kant as disingenuous and a careerist move he was riding the wave of kants incidental rediscovery and knew it and so what if some literally who publishes papers on kant that other kantians salivate over academics also publish books about the defecation habits of english diplomats during the renaissance just give it up already stop proping this irrelevant charlatan up
  what do you think of quines two dogmas of empiricism
jesus christ the absolute state of this sub i hope noone interested in kant actually reads this thread
  its been enormously informative for me i started the thread having never even heard of kant and by the end of it i had published three articles on him in nous one on each of the critiques
  kant is one of the greatest human beings to ever walk the face of the earth of course brainlets will attack him
  the early modern period includes the enlightenment kant is a wolffianleibnizian rationalist philosopher responding to his near contemporary hume as well as leibniz berkeley etc     kant is not self reflexive in fact his lack of reflexivity is what gave birth to idealism fichte  i dont know what this refers to fichte himself in the introductions to the wissenschaftslehre explicitly frames his philosophy as a mere extension of kants radical turn from previous dogmatic philosophy to transcendental idealist philosophy that begins with an analytic of the subjects constitutive role in knowledge kant called his philosophy transcendental idealism and critical idealism fichte called kant the philosopher of idealism this transcendental turn as its often called involves the subject turning inward ie reflexively and examining the conditions of the possibility of its own knowledge     postmodern philosophy is usually defined largely by its opposition to this assumption of unproblematically selfreflexive subjectivity
  what a fan
  no anon you kant
    philosophically speaking even if you believe that kants writings are lucid in which case youre on the spectrum my condolences it doesnt really matter intellectual honesty demands you to view ideas separate from their originators meaning that those translators of kant and their many interpretations have as much of a shot at philosophical value as kant himself you cant really dismiss them and you cant dismiss those who choose to stick with secondary texts because your own interpretation of kant is just a secondary text albeit unwritten one

  my home was burning my mothers face half scarred mutilated flesh i watched her frozen as she fell to her knees reaching for me to touch me one last time she died with fear in her eyes and darkness weighing down her soul it slipped from her mouth and drifted into the void that now substituted for the blue heavens id always known    the dust beneath my feet boiled and rolled tonatiuhs glow surrounding me he saw fit to protect me and in my anguish the doubts clashed with the song why was i worthy and my mother doomed yet all i could do was stand eyes set on the toobright flames watching my village collapse into soot and dust

there is a nation afar which is in the midst of drought and tens of thousands have starved to death half a million flee to the relative refuge of nearby half states lands where armed bandits roam armed with guns costing 800 dollars and bullets costing a quarter cup of grain each and you have read it in the papers no  yes i have i read it on the way to work  how much do you make in a month  im barely getting by i make 2200 a month the world is a rough place  you are an honest man and for this i admire you what did you spend on pizza burritos beer and movie tickets last month  i spent 80 dollars on burritos and pizza 120 dollars on beer amd 50 dollars on movie tickets these are the means with which i dostract myself from the offensice tedium of my underpaid labor  very well very well you are no stone breaker but your hands say you work it is true and your entertainments are compared to your fellows fairly modest as is their budget relative to your countrymen   indeed it is after many years of discipline and with a great deal of care that i keep it so  yes i see and all that makes 250 a month undoubtedly a small sum i am no arithmetician what makes this in a years spending  13 hundred  but recall i make but 22 grand a year  yes a virtuous account i am a curious man what costs a ticket there to the land afar afflicted with drought  i will play your game but surely you know it would not be safe to go there it costs 1000   and what sort of grain for 250 might you have  again it is unsafe  you are an honest man what harm in honestly answering an honest question  it would buy food for three for three months  how many are a mother and two children  three and how many would i be dead by militants soon after meeting these three  less one i answer your query for we both are on trial and of three and less one what have we  two  and of we two what is there in all honesty  there is one
first paragraph of a pseudofantasy novel    waves crashed all around as a thundering applause to the events that transpired in the past twenty four hours dark skies came down as a curtain call for the lives lost and as such the actors in this tragedy must take a bow and thank the audience for their participation in the show there was nothing but tears for what has happened the burning sensation of hatred and confusion life will never be the same the waves continued beating on the rocks simulated the bloody slaughter that transpired each broken rock a stand in for the hope lost yet with all of this hope lost victory still occurred a victory with victims a victory with broken spirits a victory without hope while the world is lost in their hopeless future a winged figure stood above the world with the last part of his future in his hands
    i have a bit more to share if anyone is interested   they say no man is an island but he felt like the bridges that connected him to the outside world were old and crumbling could his dilapidating links with humanity the variegated crowd of which he had once been a member be restored or was he doomed to repeat in isolation the monotonous routines his life had become his life had little lustre or excitement bland food blubbery shapeless body formulaic entertainment the same old movies or new ones that followed the same old formulas the same old music the same video games begun again only to be played through the same way he had played them through before each time he thought of breaking out of the prison of repetition each time he sought to rupture the continuity and start again to begin afresh he ended up falling back into old habits like his characters in those damn games the only reprieve he found from the smothering weight of mediocrity loneliness and stasis came in the form of dragon porn he loved to slather his stubby fingers and fat fleshy palm with lubiderm grab ahold of his nubbin of a pecker which engorged was as hard as a pebble and as large and furiously stroke it as images flashed before his eyes of massive batwinged green and blue behemoths sliding their scaly tails and bodies against one another blowing fire and roaring raging outwardly with the passion he felt inwardly while watching their brutish dance when ragnorathon or vitupericon finally subdued his foe and inserted into the twitching red doughnut of his rear orifice the magnificent sceptre of his passion the selfflagellant would achieve a kind of apotheosis rising out of his broken gaming chair out of his filthy and dank apartment out of the world itself he would for that brief moment be happy and free then a single sad glob would ooze onto his hand he would wipe it on his crusty pants and after a few panting moments would find himself trapped yet again behind the bars of his pitiful reality

        brainlet cope what an author of quality labors over for years to accomplish the feeling one gets when reading good literature is done by a genius just observing and learning about the world around them you need someone else to distill the sublime for you the worse form of consumption possible you will not be accepted into heaven because youve failed to see infinity in the cell or the truth of humanity in history midwits like yourselves are even worse than the true retards

is rudolf steiner any good
i once lived with a cult for lack of a better word in brazil built around the teachings of rudolf steiner every morning i would wake up and work the farm either mixing crystals into the manure or scything grass i lived on a cot on the floor and in the evenings while the rest of the community would hold study sessions to discuss the impact and importance of steiners work me and a friend would sneak off to smoke weed having stolen from a pound from some gangster and watch one piece    having never read the guy it seemed like the farm did okay didnt produce much but given that weeding and pesticides are against steiners principals there was a contextually decent yield all his followers seemed happy as well although id chalk that up to healthy country living more than any deep spiritual teachings
  were there any cute girls in said cult
  sounds comfy for a cult did you get raped
  implying healthy country living isnt the deepest spiritual teaching of them all

  literally who the fuck
  not that bad would look better without the tattoo
  shes probably browsing here right now  hey alf post some more willya 
  why do people here fixate on women that they will never get to meet why do they not focus their attention on the cute girl from class/work
  most of us are neets and girls do not like us
  she
  we dont shes the one provoking us
  can the kissing involve a little tongue blasting as well
  be prim intellectual high education woman who wears cardigans and talks about kant  still reduce self to a flaunting fuckhole for the silly boys to jerk off to after encountering a slight opposition  women truly cannot be salvaged can they
  the definition of embarassing
  start by washing your dick bucko    in al seriousness women like me and often make explicit advances on me but usually im too much of a pussy that is more enamoures with he idea of being desires than with actual girls
  its instagram culture i think they ban you if you dont post your ass in 6 months or something
  women truly cannot be salvaged can they  youre a fool for getting your hopes up to begin with
  for chrissake someone here is trying to do nofap  give me a brake

some anon actually posted yikes  absolutely based
  based yikes poster transcend websites
  is this the girl /lit/ bullied
why does ops pic look different to the actual pic is op that girl infiltrating us is everything we believe in a lie
kiss my what theres nothing there
  yes
  there are two pictures      no this is the girl that wants to be bullied by 4chan but fails at it miserable aint she 
  some of the guys trolling this egirl are posting with their real identities and its taking all the selfrestraint in the world to not doxx them so i can start even more shit

  this shit is really pathetic anon when you refer to having discipline as superpowers and vanilla sex seems amazing as the highest possible reward for fauxasceticism it just makes anyone with a normal functioning brain roll their eyes asceticism and selfdiscipline are admirable selfhelp garbage and asceticism done because my fetishes are weird and unaccepted  or similarly trite and narcissistic reasons are pathetic    also really lord of the rings characters were the best you could pull
  well she failed again  good try alf
  yeah those nofap propoganda memes always seen like their done by teenagers who still feel guilting for jackin off like when u first start wackin ur like oh shit im such a perv what if my parents catch me when ur an adult its just like a bodily function were every so often u have to have a fap and let some nut off
  masturbating is addicting i can understand people wishing to get rid of a bad habit  the memes are garbage nonetheless
  /pol9k/ has spent the past several years taking positions i almost kind of agree with until i realize theyre such obnoxious selfrighteous faggots about it all that i get disgusted  i want to say theyre doing their best but the truth is they seem permanently stuck in the mindset of children trying to own the libtards epic style
  masturbating is a lot healthier of a habit than browsing 4chan or watching anime
  this reads as though it were written by a double digit iq
  woah u mean the fucking goblins and troglodytes on r9k and pol are immature little shits who knew
  whats more pathetic a guy who jacks off to sweaty feet and asian girls puking into each others shitters or a guy who follows the chart
  how is this allowed on lit and why are canadians always so freaky   jesus christ i almost expect her face to splice and a small alien to come out of it
  i think puke fetishes should be categorized with pedophilia because the only way you could get turned on by chicks puking is if u like to rape drunk chicks like oh shit stacy is outback wreching time to make my move
  a guy capable of having control over his own life like an adult without larping as a wizard from a book of bedtime stories or trying to shape his life around charts made on anime websites
  the quality threads i expect from lit
  someone whos capable of experiencing their own existence without going wwhat if someone thinks im weird    if you have a fetish for people throwing up then thats your fetish its an expression of your mentality one of many i will tell you 100 that someone who has a puke fetish can be an upstanding human being while someone who snivels judges others for their fetishes and tries to erase their own because theyre afraid is a pathetic excuse of a human    joyce had a scat fetish dont forget it
was this provoked i havent seen any mention of her on here for like half a year
  some strays still comment on her videos and she doesnt dislike it
    pretty sure theres nothing inherently no fap about this post seems more like no porn why are you triggered by the concept of removing pornography from your life
  i disagree i actually learn stuff from this board
  i masturbated every other day when i was 16 in summer camp with no phones or computers to my imagination clearly thats the intention of this image right
  but this is 4channel not 4chan
  it never specifies but that type of autistic your absorbed jism will literally give you superpowers be inspired by wizards nonsense is characteristic of the no fap crowd  if you look carefully nobody ever said jacking off was a good thing they just called this shit out as childish
  so much this
  us  back to 4chan with you guys
  why are people turning on our 4chan brethren im legit shocked     you want this to be reddit or something faggot maybe i wanna talk about the finer points of crime and punishment while watching tentacle rape i need this place
  joyce was a genius but that doesnt mean people with strange fetishes should be encouraged anon hes not the ideal you should be aspiring to in such areas maybe plato was attracted to young boys but so what thats still not something i glorify
  but 4chan red boards is reddit
  is that the guy from die antwoord
  my point in bringing up joyce wasnt to say that scat fetishes are good and everyone should have scat fetishes it was to indicate that there is nothing inherently wrong with having a bizarre fetish and its not some aspect of your mentality to shamefully hide because its wrong     people get fixated on certain things and incorporate them into their identity the idea that theyre bad specifically and exclusively because they deviate from the norm is prime childish thinking though
  literally this
  she did it again ffs  you got rick rolled  so funny ahah
you dont subvocalize right anon
  youre just kidding yourself if you think you dont subvocalize
every reader subvocalizes
  nope i always read out loud  comme un tchad
    i am a subhuman brainlet so everyone else is to  galactic cope
  research ityoure subvocalizing
  wrong and mad
  minimize it yes but youre still moving the larynx and other muscles  this inner speech is characterized by minuscule movements in the larynx and other muscles involved in the articulation of speech most of these movements are undetectable without the aid of machines by the person who is reading
  but youre still moving the larynx and other muscles  wrong    i read insanely fast because i do not    am i going to have to do mri studies and publish in order to prove you fucking retards wrong
  yes  tiny movements in your larynx etc
  dude who cares  do you enjoy the books thats all that matters
  sorry about your low bandwidth brain but i do not subvocalize and read incredibly fast      i read academic work its insanely incredibly helpful its better than being born rich
are you kidding me of course i dont subvocalize i only read the way grown men do aloud i also have several different voices one for each character and a general one for the narrator i have a portable podium at home with a step and everything so i get up on it lay the book against it and start reading
not to mention that i learn foreign languages several times faster than normies    i cant even imagine what it must be like to be a perpetual child who has to constantly say everything in his head    even the cuntworthless shitposts on this god forsaken hellhole have to be read aloud by subbies
  do you think you have the same level of understanding of the texts you read genuinely asking  do you know if there are any techniques to stop subvocalizing or to know whether or not you do
  speed read this  another debunked claim of speedreaders is that suppressing the little voice reading along inside our head known as subvocalization can effectively help us process text faster but subvocalization plays an important role in word identification and comprehension and even people who read at 720 words per minute still generate subvocalizations    
conclusion  the takehome lesson from efforts to increase our reading speed is to question whether speedreading is a healthy aspiration at all speedreaders dont see whats on the page they read what they want to see which perhaps explains why the practice continues to thrive it must feel very good to devour a whole book in a few seconds and discover it only said what you already thought anyway but thats pretty much the opposite of learning
  worthless clickbait  lmao come back with some acual science in the future kiddo
what is subvocalizing exactly lipreading or mouthing the words or is it reading it internally with whatever voice
i do but less and less as time goes on ive noticed that my reading speed increases while the words in my head dont so the first few words of every sentence get subvocalized and blur together i dont even notice it anymore unless i look for it i suppose its just something you grow out of
  its cited in the article  
    still no gf though
  op means he reads words without any movement of his voice box larynx
  it links to the scientific literature mr speed reader  
people still responding to this shitty bait
  the virgin subvocalizer vs the chad supervocalizer
  reminder all literature is written intended for subvocalisation
he cant switch between subvocalising and not subvocalising  subvocalise for books dont subvocalise for the internet for non fiction it depends if its completely academic or if there is still an authorial voice  if the latter then subvocalise  but whatever you do do not fall for the meme of only being able to speed read because that cripples your enjoyment of books you cannot speed read ulysses and get its full worth  even something easy like lolita loses virtually everything if you dont subvocalise but at the same time dont be a literal child who subvocalises 4chan posts apparently people do that
  nice im going to speedread that
  this has to be bait  derrida started by writing for tel quel which advanced the physical properties of words  its fun to vocalize but theres no reading actual words without minute movements in your voice muscles  you can minimize it though
  its a scientific abstract no need to speed read  the current article reviews what the scientific community knows about the reading processa great dealand discusses the implications of the research findings for potential students of speedreading training programs or purchasers of speedreading apps the research shows that there is a tradeoff between speed and accuracy it is unlikely that readers will be able to double or triple their reading speeds eg from around 250 to 500750 words per minute while still being able to understand the text as well as if they read at normal speed if a thorough understanding of the text is not the readers goal then speed reading or skimming the text will allow the reader to get through it faster with moderate comprehension the way to maintain high comprehension and get through text faster is to practice reading and to become a more skilled language user eg through increased vocabulary this is because language skill is at the heart of reading speed
sometimes
  i wish i were an angel
  i was talking about the entire article seems pretty interesting
  light reading no heavy reading yes
  too
  of course i do im no pleb
subvocalize this

  it must feel very good to devour a whole book in a few seconds and discover it only said what you already thought anyway but thats pretty much the opposite of learning  implying i have a stable psychological state rooted in a safe and goodenough early childhood  implying i am an impartial seeker of truth and not some tortured soul looking for a quiet port
  huh  science says your nonvocalized reading is imaginary
  my voice is too beautiful not to
  post vocaroo
i read aloud complete with accents and emotional speech master and margarita is becoming quite a fun read
  youre in denial
    you are a stupid emotionally stunted man who has enclosed himself in a shell of bitterness and toxicity failure to break out of this shell will result in spiritual death and increasingly selfdestructive tendencies unless you change you are going to die alone and terrified
    you are a judgmental asshole with zero empathy i can tell bybthe way you write that you are a selfish jerk with nothing to offer to the world never post again leave this board and never return because you so nothing but put others down
  leave this board and never return because you so nothing but put others down  this is a case of the pot calling the kettle black
  you are not denying his initial assertion i pity you
      came to post this
  this hits too close to home at least that other guy can read fast
  you are right i was harsh needlessly so
i never subvocalized i started reading out loud like any other kid until my mum told me to do it in my head one time and that was that i dont get the subvocalizing meme
  i dont subvocalize and i didnt even know it was a thing until i was in middle school  i read around 1200 wpm for those curious
mfw i stutter even when i subvocalize
  nobody reads at 1200 wpm

not reading with the speed and intonation the author intended    how can you ignore the natural speed of the scenes and the general ductus of a book how could you ever appreciate a slow book while speed reading

difference between good and evil  inb4 meme sam harris definition
  good is selfimproving while evil has no telos often cant even define itself except in relation to what is good
  there is no binary good and evil thats purely a construction of the abrahamic filth
evil is lower vibration/resonance likewise there are many more goods that are better that wait above us on higher vibes
  the satan seems to have quite the advantage judging by his bicep
  nah its like bodybuilder muscle its all for show
  filename
good  whatever the majority thinks is the correct thing to do    evil  whatever the majority thinks is the incorrect thing to do
  evil is what you feel before you feel good and good is what you feel before evil
  yeah dude being against abortion and capital punishement is evil
good  handsome with nice hair  evil  ugly and bald
  hitler  good  mussolini  evil    im not sure i follow there pal
  hitler was ugly and had shit hair
  maybe ugly but dude could pull the widows peak
i like socrates take on it  the only evil is ignorance
  orange man bad vs brown man good
evil exists as an anathema in a righteous universe the idea that there is a divine struggle between good and evil is utter mysticism the fact that god allows evil to exist proves how powerless it really is evil is a defeated foe      it definitely isnt a binary since less good doesnt translate to more evil moreover the quantity of evil has no really bearing on the presence of good
  good and evil are by definition artificial concepts that can only theoretically occupy space in a memetic atmosphere without a memetic system of belief and without the rigorous study of memelian analysis they simply fall apart and if such a masssive belief could fall apart simply because ones own lack of expertise in the memelian and memetic mode of operation i do believe that the belief could not be worth discussing in the first place instead we should divert our attention to the sedulous analysis of divine purity to understand the unprofaned to rinse your soul of its filth that is what comes closest to the memetic belief in good to do the inverse that is to avoid purity that is what would come closest to the memelians crude definition of bad
  memetic  meme  ha good one bro
evil is people doing stuff i dont like good is people doing stuff i do like
  goodthat which partakes in the form of the good  badthat which does not
  seeks to define vague qualitative terms  uses a vague qualitative term    so like what is purity conducive to though
  he doesnt understand memetics beyond funny pictures on the internet  educate yourself you pseud     
  i agree with you it is difficult to qualitatively reason your way into a working definition of such ethereal concepts as good and evil or even purity for me personally this poem gives me a sense of it though it may not be a satisfactory response    thou dost presume too much poor needy wretch  to claim a station in the firmament  because thy humble cottage or thy tub  nurses some lazy or pedantic virtue  in the cheap sunshine or by shady springs  with roots and potherbs where thy right hand  tearing those humane passions from the mind  upon whose stocks fair blooming virtues flourish  degradeth nature and benumbeth sense  and gorgonlike turns active men to stone  we not require the dull society  of your necessitated temperance  or that unnatural stupidity  that knows nor joy nor sorrow nor your forcd  falsely exalted passive fortitude  above the active this low abject brood  that fix their seats in mediocrity  become your servile minds but we advance  such virtues only as admit excess  brave bounteous acts regal magnificence  allseeing prudence magnanimity  that knows no bound and that heroic virtue  for which antiquity hath left no name  but patterns only such as hercules  achilles theseus back to thy loathd cell  and when thou seest the new enlightened sphere  study to know but what those worthies were
  this is great stuff while hard to put in words i do believe the imagery of the work does the job well really freud was right to describe moral feelings as oceanic    very cool anon
  good is controlling your animalistic urges with your own power and deterring people who wish to not do so evil is the opposite
  someone concerned with the collective with helping others good vs someone that is only out to benefit themselves evil  most people fall somewhere in the middle helping out themselves and their family their neighborhood  some people confuse the desire to do good with forcing others to help others these are the truly evil people that disguise themselves as good in order to benefit themselves eg leftist politicians that claim they want want equality for all and to spread the wealth yet are themselves millionaires/billionaires  true good means helping others learn how to help themselves and not expecting anything in return ie charity not welfare gibs
how many philosophers are you allowed to reference in a novel before you alienate any chance of readership or sound like a psuede
one any more than that and it feels like youre trying way too hard to seem smart
  dont you know the only ideas worth reading are those that were written by someone else
  saul bellow references philosophers the most imo
  lol cute kids p
ive only written like 7k words but ive already referenced 9 philosophers is this a problem
literally zero
as long as they are properly referenced in a footnote
  zero but use their ideas
  if you say x once said in a work of fiction you are a pseud you can communicate a philosophical idea without actually name dropping the philosopher
  hows it feel being a plagiarist if one hant the decencie to make attributions where said attributions are due one is beer off in sincerity cultivating one his own ideas
  we already had this thread     and the answer is one
  ive written 5k but its just the word nigger interspersed with philosophers names
  based
  literature has been saved
  okay but how many footnotes are allowed can i just claim its a parody of dfw or something and litter it
  i think its different if a character says that though since that could come up naturally in a conversation
  patrician way is to not actually mention the philosophy and say well i suppose x was right without ever explaining it
  i wrote one page and i referenced around sixty philosophers
  theres not plagium if everybody knows whats up
  did it get published though
a novel    you can get away with mentioning just one  more than one you have to thoroughly but succinctly explain that philosphers point and the relevance to the idea at hand  more than one per major idea and you have to do some synthesizing
    id welcome a fiction meant to illustrate a philosophical concept if you go down that road you have to go all the way no shallow name drops show your work tell me why philosophy isnt just a bunch of useless bullshit
ive only mentioned one philosopher in all of my fiction writings and that was plato but ive used dozens of other philosophers ideas as if they were my own working elaborations of their ideas into my characters thoughts feelings words actions  i portray my simulation of reality in fiction as if it were philosophical material just as much as my philosophicallythemed reflections give birth to these scenes in my mind  the struggle between stirner and nietzsche inside of my mind is what has kept my mind fruitful active and the people whom i write for are people like myself
  its a book about a philosophy student writing a dissertation so a lot of it is actually focusing on the ideas heres a badly offending passage is this overbearing
bump
  no but im also a philosophy student so maybe im wrong    besides the indents i like it feels new so to speak
lars iyer does it all the time
daily reminder that your intelligence is genetically determined that if youve been flaky all your life you will never be productive no amount of effort will turn you into a talented person if youre genetically predisposed to need immediate rewards you will never finish long term projects in other words you will never be a decent writer unless you won the genetic lottery
  good thing i won it also based macron
  good thing i won it     posts on /lit/  thinks he is smart
  im in my 30s and i failed at everything so far i will never come to terms with it and ill probably kill myself whenever i try to better myself i fail miserably and i get even more depressed
  its ok bro dont off yourself lets unite and admire the superior men of our time
  visiting a literature site has nothing to do with your intelligence plus /lit/ is best literature website in the world whos better plebbit fagreads some literally who forum
  it does when you visit it for that dopamine hit attached with web forums and image boards
  im living proof that this is wrong misspent my teen years and half of my twenties i frequently procrastinated and avoided responsibilities then i matured and eventually went on to earn my phd now i have several published articles dont lose faith in yourselves young men of /lit/
  i thought that i would amount to something but life humiliated me so many times i just cant get up anymore i dont have the will nor the strength to go on i struggle so much just to keep existing and i think im honestly tired of it
  getting phd in the humanities   publishing in humanities journals  thinking that counts as turning your genetic makeup around     lmao
  you cant help that though are you saying smart people dont visit any social network or any other sites that boost dopamine because ive seen plenty of writers and filmmakers using them and not just your average ya or bluckbuster creators but actual artists
  as opposed to what doing nothing and perishing like a dog because you werent born a genius
  filmmakers  actual artists     aanon ii have bad news
  artist  noun  a person who practices any of the various creative arts such as a sculptor novelist poet or filmmaker
  i didnt need this today op
  are you saying guillermo del toro and alfonso cuarón arent artists pans labyrinth and roma arent works of art
  what about the definition of actual artist      pretty much yes
  pretty much yes  then less than 1 of writers would even try there are lots of writers who knew they werent geniuses yet they tried
  whats the point i tried drawing and painting for 6 years and despite all the study and effort i could barely produce amateur work while 16 year olds made masterpieces so i just quit if you dont have talent theres no point competing there are people destined to be consumers and people destined to produce and invent i understood that i was a consumer this is my role its delusional to keep believing ill amount to something
  it seems like you just werent born with creativity nor imagination i thought you at least had those why were you even trying to be an artist just because
  i liked doing it and i had a passion for it but when youre aware of your inadequacy passion turns into frustration in the end i only felt anger when painting because all my works were failures
this is called learned helplessness op you very much can change the fact that you are a flake and turn into a productive person there are many ways towards self improvement but the only right way is to figure it out on your own im in my twenties doing it right now im experiencing tremendous amounts of growth as when i realized how dumb and needy of instant gratificiation i was i was pretty much bottm of the barrel working on overriding dmn inhabiting space between stimuli and reactionmeditation pomodoro technique works well to kickstart a working session read mihaly work on flow and understand what variables need to be corrected in order to reach flow state also eat healthy and exercise cause its good for you sorry youre having a tough time but you are never locked by your biology one can argue about exactly where the line is placed between the gradient of nature vs nurture but one thing that scientists and all of us intuitively know is that its not just one but both    i never post and i cant be bothered to proofread so no brainlet posts    pic related
  regardless of ones proximity to the edge of an abyss it remains unfathomable to all
  thats cool but i can still maximize the intelligence i do have in conjunction with the venting of my strength via will and thats more than even the most intelligent people ever do honestly im more stressed out by the lottery of fortune than i am my genetic predisposition imagine all the bards better than homer that just didnt gain traction were arbitrarily lost to history etc hence nietzsches focus on ensuring the former cultivation of the will and the deeply reverent understanding of chance
  this is a really fucking terrible attitude to have  i cant be the best so whats the point  watch amadeus
nice to see determinism is become much more prevalent now
  that if youve been flaky all your life you will never be productive  my parents are flaky and they produced me and my siblings and afforded to send us all to college so i dont buy your non/lit/ thread

  jokes on you i abuse adderall
  when you cant even be mediocre youre just wasting your time only literal retards keep smashing against the wall
  start microdosing adderall it wont fuck up your brain permanently at all 
  as much as i hate to admit it youre right if youre not extraordinarily talented you really should just keep writing as a hobby    
this is terrible advice and op is projecting his failures as a genetic crutch i bet op is fat as well thats genetic being fat and unable to get your shit done
    marks character james bennet is a text book case pathological gambler how he teaches and the things he is saying to his students only illustrates his distorted and negative view of the world and his own personal life hes trapped between all or nothing black or white genius or mediocrity happy or unhappy high level or low level selflove or self hate his teaching style is unhealthy negative and irresponsible his lecture isnt enlightening anyone all this was part of illustrating the hidden mental disease of a gambling addict
  hes right for the most part but still people decided to write even after knowing shakespeare was this giant wrier what would have happened if they they decided not to we wouldnt even have 90 of all the good literature my advice is if you werent born a genius like most of the planet but you have creativity and imagination try it and work hard a hard working man with creativity and imagination is in some cases more successful than a lazy genius and remember that not everyone can be shakespeare and not everyone is even trying to do so
  wow
  i feel the same way but only 19 how have you made it into your 30s
  when beethoven died there was a musical drought because most european composers couldnt bear to write in the shadow of his reputation but had all of them adopted this attitude there wouldnt have been a schubert granted you might say that schubert was a genius of equal calibre to beethoven but the principle holds creativity is healthy but comparing yourself to genius isnt
  i am fat
  behave one way as a child  behave another way as an adolescent   behave in a completely different way as an adult  behave completely differently depending on my enivronment  behave autistically in all situations  yeah it must be my genetics
  im sorry i didnt mean to be so mean get skinny and get your shit done genetics means nothing
  ive stayed a neet at home on a shitton of antidepressants that barely work the only reason i havent offed myself is my cat i dont want her to end up in a shelter
  genetics means nothing  i think youre swinging a little too far in the right direction
  genetics mean something but forgetting about everything because boo hoo im not a genius mommy is for the weak
people are capable of incredible transformations going from flab to fab or ignoramus to knowledgable from unable to do something to able to do it this happens all the time and people with good genes dont just sit there through it all like its a movie and watch it unfold as their magic genes scurry about and do everything for them like helpful little gnomes they try too they fuck up too they get overwhelmed as well they waste time and procrastinate and have fears
  uh oh
dopamine is supposed to be released when we make something not consume something everyone takes in food or porn or drugs and uses up their dopamine there is nothing left to be released when you do something attainable small and good like picking up a dirty sock basically clean your room make shit but fuck peterson
stupid people can do wonders if they study logic and master the drudgery of erudition even more so for those who are more intellegen  deficts in attention motivation and executive functioning can be treated with metabolic wellness a healthy diet regular exercise nutrition and trained habits ecological wellness too and dont forget drugs   people can get better at living thats a fact getting better at living is what life is trying to do
  food  the principle is good but i dont think it really applies to food u need food to make energy to make stuff including dopamine
  yeah who needs humanities when i can just parrot shit i heard on pol instead
  people with good genes dont just sit there  true because their genetic makeup makes them do something about it
  polygenic levels are the best predictors of educational achievement for example we live in a hierarchy and some people are just more suited to succeed than others
  if by succeed you mean please our jewish masters then sure
  yeah but texture and processed food is a dopamine succubus hotpockets dont taste like anything its all bready texture and filling i meant to say real food vs salty sweet gooey processed box food if its in a box its just like fapping all the time it will drain you
  you seem obsessed with looking at life as though it is and could only ever be a race or a competition start by ridding yourself of this its an incredibly limited outlook resulting from your underdeveloped mind
  food has been a major thing ive been tackling in regards to my own development and to fight my depression this last couple of months i know how to lift weights but i always thought that if i exercise i can do whatever i want last year i gained 40 excess lbs and i was able to lose them all and am slowly starting to be both happy and intigued with how this flesh vessel works biomechanically    ill save condense my major revelations    people naturally are prone to consume way too much suger and carbohydrates which your body likes but its easy to overeat as they cause high insulin spike which makes you feel hubgry again quicker i started here and did keto diet i know fad diet i realized how much sugar and shit food cravings a had every couple hours i did keto/carnivoreish diet so i basically ate steak all day every day and cauliflower rice and not only did it taste really good but i was satiated for very long stretches of time once i got a hold on keto i started to mix in exercise which was fine for a while but keto isnt great for buding muscle mostly just slimming down and fixing your stomach microbiome basically your stomach is like a second brain in regards to conplexity    there are a musltitude of factors that lead you body to gain weight and heres where dumb people sometimes miss nuance     its not as simple as calorie in calorie out    your body has something a a switch which is controlled by hormones which are controlled by what you eat and that switch tells your body when to put on weight and when to start burning    this is a super simplified way of looking at it but undertaking this step has probably been the best thing i ever done    youre not alone neither are you a slave to your biology    ill save a
  oh and wash youre penis
  come on board full of insecure manchildren   post to derive pleasure from exploiting their vulnerabilities   muh genetics  make deductions even the more qualified geneticists wouldnt dare make  obviously doesnt grasp the concepts beyond a basic level just spouting it out    irony is op if gratuitous cruelty towards feeble souls like the ones of young aspiring artists is a defining character trait of yours you will ultimately lead a life endlessly more meaningless and pathetic than a thousand failed artists
  no study has found 100 heritability for intelligence    heritability doesnt mean you cant change    everyone has environments they can succeed well in and ones they dont    things like random events/bad luck environments that prevent you nurturing your goals and just sheer ignorance all have undeniable effects and for this even smart and talented people will fail most of the time through fate and the bottlenecks we impose on social climbing    no one really knows what their genetic predispositions are
  this is why our society keeps rewarding mediocrity with participation prizes instead of sorting the worthy from the chaff and to what results id rather make room for someone with actual talent than delude myself that my work is worth noticing when its clearly not life is a race and there are losers
  i wish i lived in a society that didnt stigmatize suicide so i could transition to a more productive state without hurting my family
  again your aforementioned obsession betrays you i didnt say that there wasnt competition or competitive elements in life there are and yes there is a purpose to them however this is absolutely not all there is to life and your beliefs display a disproportionate reverence for this specific part of life     your assertion that your work is not worth noticing is a selfjudgement i dont know you personally but id imagine youre too harsh on yourself this is true even if your work is garbage because in that case your harshness towards yourself takes form in not allowing yourself to believe you can improve among others probably besides even if you never become an artist there are many other ways to contribute to the world if you cant accept this then youre obsessed with a self image of a future artist which has become unhealthy suicide solves nor helps any of these problems there is no other one that youll be making room for you cant know whether or not you are or will one day be worthy its all in your head
  cudos
clean your room
  sounds like a disciplinelet coping    you realize that monastic sects are a thing and have been for millennia right are all the monks that join a sect just people who were predetermined to be disciplined and productive
  implying living up to genetic potential is good  the limbic system is a meme just fucking do or dont without a goal to justify it  fucking zoomers kek
  then less than 1 of writers would even try  what a coincidence less than 1 of writers are good
  no less than 1 are geniuses being good is rather easy
  its not in my head lol i had 30 years to try and i failed everything
  intelligence is partly genetic but productivity is not you can become productive and turn your life around without being a genius narcissistic autists dreaming about writing the novel of the century are idiots however

hey friends im just interested in narcissism and would like to delve more deeply into its causes and effects on society what is some recommended literature looking specifically for philosophy    ps sorry about yesterday it was not my intent for the thread to go offtopic like that
is this the new incel thread
is this postirony
  yep    just plain old faggotry
  approaching people randomly in public    jesus just go to a social event/club where people actually want you to do that
  im curious to see this guys progression is he really going to sperg at a thousand women until one of them gives him attention
  he needs to get a job in fast food very quickly will he learn how to deal with people and respect boundaries
  interested in narcissism  narcissism is a low iq person catchall term for someone they dont like vain superficial egotistical unempathetic etc are all more nuanced words that actually mean something  narcissism is a dumbdown amalgamation of various emotions packaged into a pathological entity its pop psychology that has never went away  pure cringe to think its something you can dive seriously into
  this is literally something a narcissist would post
im a pathological narcissist so believe me im the expert on it ama
narcissists are boring af psychopaths are much more interesting
    12 rules for life    jp saved me fo sirrius
  this pseud thinks hes not a narcissist lmao
  psychopathic loser spotted psychopaths are like robots but dumber
  
  why do you think you are a narcissist
  i was diagnosed while in a state psychiatric facility
  bipolar beats them all
  for  he said about  0/8 dont post again
  psychopaths are much more interesting  psychopaths arent cool antisocial rebels theyre just really shitty people
  describe yourself habits and characteristics you have that are inherently narcissistic
  narcissist  unironically believes what a bunch of fucking pseud psychatrists with a stick up their ass have to say  fuck off kid
    yyou must be a narcisssist  its just a term for someone that you dont like its a boogeyman instead of picking apart the qualities about them that make them narcissistic you just call them this catchall phrase and are on your way youre the ones making a sweeping generalization
  im so much smarter than you peasants who believe in things like narcissism i am so glad i am above you  narcissist
  this post sounds like narcissism but okay
  self esteem rapidly fluctuates along with self perception/image social criticism results in a marked volatile response i grossly overestimate my performance in anything i have issues with empathy depending on my mindset which is largely determined by my self image i tend to dominate conversations i am referred to as cocky
  who should we believe clinical professionals or the random pseud or 4channel who claims narcissism doesnt exist
  youre so arrogant you wanna know why i identify as a narcissist because after a little while you start to wonder why the hell everyone around you is acting victimized whenever you feel like the victim its healthy for me and has resulted in deeper self awareness
    cases in point nice way to totally ignore reality must be easier whenever you dont need to deconstruct the person just call them a narcissist and voilà problem solved
  hey narcissist anon how much longer are you going to post the same thread
  
  this seriously
  everyone around you is acting victimized whenever you feel like the victim  what do you mean by this
  also genuinely curious
  you sound cute
  lol i dont think you understand it    narcissism is where you need to be in love with your social reflection and you see everything as a reflection of you that way of putting it makes the etymology make sense its very different from vanity
ive had numerous situations in my life in which someone insults me and then i overreact and end up going overboard on getting even ive hurt some people very badly
  sorry i cant hear you my work computer doesnt have speakers if you want to reply to me just type it
  iii cant hear u anonssorry can you pplease type it for me  eternally assblasted
  by that metric 80 of people are narcissists which harms the argument that its some distinct pathological entity its a useless buzzword used by the likes of jordan peterson
  oh so you were just going to insult me glad i didnt click on it then
  why are narcissists so obsessed with jordan peterson
  i am not a narcissist you just happen to think i am because you cant handle differences of opinions
  you are a narcissist suffering from a delusion that you have greater insight than people who study for years in the field of psychology and become professionals in their field     what do you do for a living what authority do you have to claim that all these professionals are wrong and you solely you are correct
  appeal to authority and use of circular reasoning to deduce delusion and narcissism which are used as ad hominem insults in your post  there isnt a wide body of professionals obsessed over narcissism it just happens to be a poppsychology term that everyone likes and the perfect scapegoat to project your distaste of an individual on to a mold to fit all people you dislike
  appeal to authority  as i thought  can you provide even single thing to backup your claims
  youre delusional youre not some deep intellectual who sees through some unjust system youre just a dumb kid spouting edgy trash on the internet    there is zero reason to believe you over actual professionals in their respective fields zero no offense but youre talking about things you dont understand at all
  invoking fallacies outside of academics and formal debates  sounds like the fallacy fallacy to me  the fact that the word narcissism is overused obviously doesnt mean its not a real condition  the fact that youre denying its existence so vehemently points to your being a narcissist in denial
are there any musicians that you respect for their lyrics or are singersongwriters just a meme

ozzy wrote some beautiful songs most of you will bark at that because you arent as based as me but its true    the minutemen and joe baiza of saccharine trust     i mean lyrics generally exist in a really specific context op on their own theyre usually not good at all but if you read along the lyrics to my war while listening to it youll feel  immense passion    if i had a gun id wanna kill some
  there are but nick cave is definitely not one of them  hannah montana does the african savannah  as the simulated rainy season begins  she curses the queue at the zoo loos  and moves on to amazonia  cries with the dolphins  the maimai eat the pigmy the pigmy eat the monkey  the monkey has a gift that he is sending back to you  look here come the missionary  with his smallpox and flu  saving them savages with his higgs boson blues  hes a great performer but a lot of his lyrics are just truly honestly terrible
  dude i completely agree the powers that b hits me so hard almost exclusively from a lyrical standpoint say hey kid and centuries of damn in particular
my boy sufjan has a lot of lovely lyrics  the whole of all delighted people i think is great poetically as well as carrie and lowell
isaac brock has some great lyrics for modest mouse especially the first albums which he wrote for when he was 20
  nick drake is a pretty good lyricist
jim morrison  im surprised no one has mentioned him yet
  jim morrison was a fuckin poet       thats one of his worst lyrically mercy seat and the carny are both pretty stellar as are a lot of the songs off of the boatmans call     id also recommend stings lyrics from his first solo effort dream of the blue turtles minus the opening pop track even his lyrics with the police were mostly decent
a country dance was being held in a garden  i felt a bump and heard an oh beg your pardon  suddenly i saw polka dots and moonbeams  all around a pugnosed dream    the music started and was i the perplexed one  i held my breath and said may i have the next one  in my frightened arms polka dots and moonbeams  sparkled on a pugnosed dream    there were questions in the eyes of other dancers  as we floated over the floor  there were questions but my heart knew all the answers  and perhaps a few things more    now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter  i know the meaning of the words ever after  and ill always see polka dots and moonbeams  when i kiss the pugnosed dream      why dont they write like this anymore
    
  ozzy osboure did not write his songs  when someone tried to sue him claiming his music made a kid kill himself it was admitted in court he did not write the lyrics
  a lot of metal songwriters seem to have been failed or potential poets

luis eduardo aute  silvio rodríguez  fernando delgadillo  all of them are trobadours and in spanish but their lyrics are generally poetic and deep specially aute listen to that guy if you understand the language
i mean the plebobvious answer is hallelujah but that song was written over the course of years not hours or days it makes sense that its better than just any old throwaway not just anyone is cohen but maybe if songwriters took more time developing their lyrics the singersongwriter would be more than a meme    i think the mountain goats manage to say a lot in an interesting way if it was just about the sound/feel of it and not what you hear when you listen i wouldnt like them nearly as much

john michael tabbot    when the father longed to show  a love he wanted us to know  he sent his only son and so  became a holy embryo    that is the mystery  more than you can see  give up on your pondering  and fall down on your knees    a fiction as fantastic and wild  a mother made by her own child  a hopeless babe who cried  was god incarnate and man deified    that is the mystery  more than you can see  give up on your pondering  and fall down on your knees    because the fall did devastate  creator must now recreate  so to take our sin  was made like us so we could be like him

jacques brel wrote some pretty powerful lyrics although often poorly translated heres an example    in the port of amsterdam  the sailors sing  of the dreams that haunt them  in the great barging coasts  in the port of amsterdam  the sailors sleep  like ancient willows that weep  along mournful riverbanks  in the port of amsterdam  sailors are dying  bulging with beer and catastrophe  at the first light of dawn  but in the port of amsterdam  there are sailors being born  in the suffocating heat  of groaning doldrums  in the port of amsterdam  the sailors eat  streaming fish  on toowhite napkins  they flash their teeth  that can crush fortunes  that can swallow the moon  and devour its shroud  and the place stinks of cod  seeping into the heart of chips  that their huge hands welcome  only to come back for more  then they stand up and laugh  like the roar of storms  zip up their flies  and leave with a swagger  in the port of amsterdam  the sailors dance  rubbing their paunches  against womens bellies  and they turn and they dance  like suns spat  from the ragged sound  of a rancid accordion  they twist their necks  the better to hear each other laugh  till with a sudden jolt  the accordion expires  so with this doleful sign  so with proud looks  they go home with their sluts  till the full light of dawn  in the port of amsterdam  the sailors drink  and drink and drink again  and drink one for the road  they drink to the health  of the whores of amsterdam  or of hamburg or elsewhere  in fact they drink to the ladies  who give them their beautiful bodies  who give them their innocence  for a coin of gold  and when they have drunk enough  they turn their faces to the sky  they blow their noses in the stars  and they piss like i cry  on our unfaithful wives  in the port of amsterdam  in the port of amsterdam      a black eyed dog he knew my name i always found this line to be particularly unnerving good taste anon

late walkers my nominee but i also like spinetta thats a disclaimer    had forgotten this song good one    seconding    theres a compilation of walkers covers of brel any good
no robert hunter    probably the most /lit/ lyricist of all time     if my words did glow with the gold of sunshine  and my tunes were played on the harp unstrung  would you hear my voice come through the music  would you hold it near as it were your own  its a handmedown the thoughts are broken  perhaps theyre better left unsung  i dont know dont really care  let there be songs to fill the air     ripple in still water  when there is no pebble tossed  nor wind to blow    reach out your hand if your cup be empty  if your cup is full may it be again  let it be known there is a fountain  that was not made by the hands of man  there is a road no simple highway  between the dawn and the dark of night  and if you go no one may follow  that path is for your steps alone

normally when people fondle over middlebrow trash i can ignore it but the love that morrissey is getting in this thread is mindblowing he is the epitome of everything that is wrong with indie   look how small and unimportant and sad life is   couldnt possibly be more boring his voice by the way is whiny and annoying with very little redeeming qualities or range of abilities and if you like it youre literally a coffee shop art hoe and always will be his voice sucks his lyrics suck his band had one passable album and it really isnt even that good and his referencing oscar wilde is eye rolling because wilde would have hated him

scott walker comes to mind when i think of lyricists as poets his wordplay and deliberate phonetics are unique as far as im aware    cut to lost lumbago city  i am perched against the sky  a banner shoal of sparrows  sways in the twilight  down there as ish kabibbles  schlepp the shade forever  earths hoary fontenelle  weeps softly for a thumb thrust  a chorus of threadbare blackstockinged legs  is fanning out into a frazzled black rose  no phalanxes fleeing like zippers of blood  red plumes nodding between the horses ears
  his spoken word album gets shit on a lot but it is in fact legendary  
  good on you m8
frusciantes 90s era had his most interesting lyrics imo inspired by crowley nietzsche and burroughs  his life at that point is a good insight into hedonism too
  seconded i also recommend put my dream on this planet jandeks first spoken word release its even more powerful than his acoustic albums imo
  i love selling england by the pound its beautiful the supermarket puns always get me   easy love theres the safe way home  thankful for her fine fair discount tess cooperates

  amateur trash
  brand new
  hate his politics but i sure do enjoy his music
  based
  the triumvirat  léo ferré  jacques brel  georges brassens somewhat
its probably about the way they are sung but his lyrics hit me hard
  nice anon came here to mention bird love the way certain melodies and motifs slowly transform from album to album
  woah ooh woah ooh woah  baked beans by the fire  with my busted stovepipe hat  this lonely hobo sleeps in a tire  in an abandoned circus with a oneeyed cat  truly the pinnacle of lyrics
morrison
  bob dylan  darkness at the break of noon  shadows even the silver spoo  the handmade blade the childs balloon  eclipses both the sun and moon  to understand you know too soon  there is no sense in trying      pointed threats they bluff with scorn  suicide remarks are torn  from the fools gold mouthpiece the hollow horn  plays wasted words proves to warn  that he not busy being born is busy dying      temptations page flies out the door  you follow find yourself at war  watch waterfalls of pity roar  you feel to moan but unlike before  you discover that youd just be one more  person crying      so dont fear if you hear  a foreign sound to your ear  its alright ma im only sighing
  ayy a man of taste
wagner
  if they are amateurs show me what you got in fact show me a pro if dylan is an amateur
  the english translation of this is horrendous  why is english such a shit language for poetry and rhythm
  agreed most people who dismiss dylans lyrics as amateur or pedestrian are just edgy contrarians i dont know how you could listen to the last four tracks of bringing it all back home and not be somewhat impressed especially considering he was 24 when he released three seminal albums in the span of one year
  considering he was 24 when he released three seminal albums in the span of one year  i still cannot believe that a 22yearold wrote the times theyre achanging he must have had a ghostwriter
  excellent choice my favorite song on the album and no one agrees with me likewise i love the murder mystery off velvet underground s/t so much
  i typically listen to music without vocals or vocals in another language because bad lyrics ruin a song for me  but one artist i found in the last couple years who really impressed me was joanna newsom   its sometimes hard to understand her while shes singing but when i puzzled it out or read the words i was blown away  sapokanikan and waltz of the 101st lightborne are genuinely superb  especially the latter   through a love song she tells the story of a futuristic civilization that time travels to colonize planets because theyve used up all of the present available planets and make war against themselves from other times for real estate    as the day is long  so the well runs dry  and we came to see time is taller  than space is wide  and we bade goodbye  to the great divide  found unlimited simulacreage to colonize    but there was a time we were lashed to the prow  of a ship you may board but not steer  before you and i ceased to mean now  and began to mean only right here  to mean inches and miles but not years    before space had a taste of its limits  and a new sort of coordinate awoke  making time just another poor tenant  bearing weight taking fire trading smokes  in the war between us and our ghosts    i think thats just neat
  also a big fan of joanna i like other lyricists like leonard cohen but shes on her own level in my mind i think you need to listen to her music while reading the lyrics when you first listen to her because the two work in conjunction   i particularly love the album divers saw her performing it in bristol in how it all slots together too  each song has its own story/theme but they all slot together in the overarching theme that is the passage of time i was slightly obsessed with it at the time it came out and spent ages deciphering all the lyrics until i felt i could understand it all  i think my favourite moment on the album is the end of time is a symptom even though its almost corny   also  first line is sending the first troops over  last line is ends transmit transcsend  same bird call plays  the album forms a loop  theres just so much to dig into and her words are so beautiful shes mentioned nabokov in interviews as a favourite and i think it shows in her writing
im not a lyricsfag i believe that lyrics can be at most the cherry on top of an already great song because of this the songs that have lyrics that i like its more that i like the way the music works with the lyrics so most of them will probably do nothing for someone who hasnt heard the song helpless child medicine bottle michael don aman two headed boy part two there is a light that never goes out cemetry gates but just to add to the newsom circlejerk  but always up the mountainside youre clambering  groping blindly hungry for anything  picking through your pocket linings well what is this  scrap of sassafras eh sisyphus  i see the blossoms broke and wet after the rain  little sister he will be back again  i have washed a thousand spiders down the drain  spiders ghosts hang soaked and dangling  silently from all the blooming cherry trees  in tiny nooses safe from everyone  nothing but a nuisance gone now dead and done  be a woman be a woman  is she /lit/s favourite musician it seems like it from this thread also heres some nick drake that i feel works even without the music  please beware of them that stare  theyll only smile to see you while  your time away  and once youve seen what they have been  to win the earth just wont seem worth  your night or your day  wholl hear what i say  look around you find the ground  is not so far from where you are  but dont be too wise  for down below they never grow  theyre always tired and charms are hired  from out of their eyes
  know its a meme but neutral milk hotel is hella nice and father john misty too  the night mister tillmann is my go to im hurt by love song and its awesome

  i know its almost impossible to comprehend how he managed the times they are achanging blowin in the wind a hard rains a gonna fall dont think twice its alright and masters of war before he even turned 23 its very possible he had a ghostwriter though i doubt it

  do you think he became like that because of hedonism i would assumed the opposite like he became some sort of a neohermit to avoid the material/hedonistic world

  in the port of amsterdam  theres a sailor who sings  of the dreams that he brings  from the wide open sea  in the port of amsterdam  theres a sailor who sleeps  while the river bank weeps  to the old willow tree  in the port of amsterdam  theres a sailor who dies  full of beer full of cries  in a drunken town fight  in the port of amsterdam  theres a sailor whos born  on a hot muggy morn  by the dawns early light  in the port of amsterdam  where the sailors all meet  theres a sailor who eats  only fish heads and tails  and hell show you his teeth  that have rotted too soon  that can haul up the sails  that can swallow the moon  and he yells to the cook  with his arms open wide  hey bring me more fish  throw it down by my side  and he wants so to belch  but hes too full to try  so he stands up and laughs  and he zips up his fly  in the port of amsterdam  you can see sailors dance  paunches bursting their pants  grinding women to porch  theyve forgotten the tune  that their whiskey voice croaked  splitting the night  with the roar of their jokes  and they turn and they dance  and they laugh and they lust  till the rancid sound of the accordion bursts  and then out of the night  with their pride in their pants  and the sluts that they tow  underneath the street lamp  in the port of amsterdam  theres a sailor who drinks  and he drinks and he drinks  and he drinks once again  hell drink to the health  of the whores of amsterdam  whove given their bodies  to a thousand other men  yeah theyve bargained their virtue  their goodness all gone  for a few dirty coins  when he just cant go on  throws his nose to the sky  aims it up above  and he pisses like i cry  on the unfaithful love
  cant believe how strange it is to be anything at all

what are your thoughts on the freemasonry present in war and peace
  i have been to a freemasons lodge yesterday they were really nice people do not understand what all the fuss is about
  theyre typically wonderful people ive considered joining myself as for the freemasonry in war and peace tolstoy read about it at the time and added it more as an afterthought it wasnt part of the story initially
they fuck skulls
    tolstoy did a lot of research on the freemasons when he was working on war and peace he read many documents letters books etc    im one of his letters to his wife he wrote the problem with the freemasons is that they are all a bunch of idiots at least here were i live in brazil his conclusion is 100 accurate just a grown men boyscouts club filled with people wanting to lick each others ass for favors and business deals a middle class and rich peoples club with some magic crap sprinkled over it
i never understood what the point of the lodge in that book was except to show that bezukhov is an easily manipulated idiot
in a novel that deals with so much that is universal it sticks out like a sore thumb freemasonry is an irrelevance
  this is probably it he is swept immediately by whatever proposes to cure his existential dread iirc in that scene where he meets the guy at the train station it doesnt take him long to join the cult right after
almost half way through just finished the chapters where the rostovs are wolf hunting absolutely brilliant
what are some books about how to stop being an ugly blackpilled loser with no motivation to do anything productive in my huge amounts of free time

the fuck is this book so popular   its incomprehensible   what am i missing
titty like dumpling onion knight from dark souls also mmm very good onion dumpling thanks for posting
  its virtually unread these days
  hersheys kiss drum cymbal bob
maplestory slime
  it was popular because of the controversy surrounding it  as  says it is virtually unread these days my boy miller is slipping away into the ether of forgotten figures mostly because he has nothing lasting to say really pretty sure deleuze was the last guy to treat him as a figure worth commenting upon  burroughs pretty much has miller beat on all counts obscenity abstract mayhem prophetic ramblings drugged out ambience etc  but the book is far from incomprehensible idk what your problem is
i read it and its got a lot of problems the sex is no longer a very good literary device in 2018 however there are a few passages about life and art that are deeply beautiful the story about taking the whores money was especially great     i got sick quite quickly of the lack of cohesion and a narrative but the work is just supppsed to be millers crazy stories in france i can absolutely understand the imperwnce of this book and what it meant to art for a long time olympia press published it and it was the same publishing house that worked with burroughs who is part of the same movement some yuppies actually still believe this work has gravitas in a world of thots and rampant narcissism the dream of poets of yesteryear cape true every mustache latte bugman is henry miller and every lonely girl informed by twitter nihilism is sylvia plath their dream is here and its shit the zeitgeist is shifted the future of subversion is looking quite interesting
  youre a virgin
  there is no narrative thread its a long ass rant on women whoring and writing
miller was my grandfathers author and it wasnt until i read that book that i felt weird about it    it was incredibly controversial and read at the time and a couple of decades after for its very descriptive portrayal of sex
  its one of m favourite books
what about it is so incomprehensible i undesrtood most of it if not whatever message he was trying to convey
want to write a novel  have amazing ideas in your head  have clear idea of now novel will start and end  begin writing  get a couple paragraphs out  5 hours later havent done anything but a few paragraphs  every single time  why is being an author suffering
most authors writing fiction are pretty happy to get 500 words out of a hard days work    theres plenty of interviews with authors on the net detailing their everyday working lives
i feel i should do x because its so easy for me to imagine being successful at it but when i try i fail at actual craft of x  every time
just write lol
william gass was a genius but he admitted that he was an extremely slow writer i always have ideas but as soon as i get in front of a word processor they suddenly vanish its the worst feel
  youre not a talented author and should stop wasting time on a dead art that a freakishly small number of people were ever good at the miniscule proportion of writers and poets worth anything should dissuade anyone who isnt 99th percentile verbal immediately you have a better chance of becoming a viruoso or a physicist at your late age than a master author or poet retard      brainlet
  never have the beginning and end sortes before writing you can have one or the other because as soon as you do both the entire narrative you craft in your head will always hit your knowledge of start and finish it limits you    what makes an author is the ability to craft new lines based on predicate alone it is how you build the story piece by piece never by blueprint
  not everyone wants the top of the pyramid dude
  im pretty sure youre wrong thats just a suicideprevention attitude
  those that crave mountains to submit are people who were told its the only way to live    the moment is now for rulers and rabble alike to have a perspective of your own timeline that just because someone else or your culture said so you too must desire their exclusive path    the inclusive narrative

  why do so many people on a literature board love one of the best writers to ever live  really makes you think
by henry wadsworth longfellow    we sat within the farmhouse old   whose windows looking oer the bay  gave to the seabreeze damp and cold   an easy entrance night and day    not far away we saw the port   the strange oldfashioned silent town  the lighthouse the dismantled fort   the wooden houses quaint and brown    we sat and talked until the night   descending filled the little room  our faces faded from the sight   our voices only broke the gloom
we spake of many a vanished scene   of what we once had thought and said  of what had been and might have been   and who was changed and who was dead    and all that fills the hearts of friends   when first they feel with secret pain  their lives thenceforth have separate ends   and never can be one again    the first slight swerving of the heart   that words are powerless to express  and leave it still unsaid in part   or say it in too great excess
the very tones in which we spake   had something strange i could but mark  the leaves of memory seemed to make   a mournful rustling in the dark    oft died the words upon our lips   as suddenly from out the fire  built of the wreck of stranded ships   the flames would leap and then expire    and as their splendor flashed and failed   we thought of wrecks upon the main  of ships dismasted that were hailed   and sent no answer back again
the windows rattling in their frames   the ocean roaring up the beach  the gusty blast the bickering flames   all mingled vaguely in our speech    until they made themselves a part   of fancies floating through the brain  the longlost ventures of the heart   that send no answers back again    o flames that glowed o hearts that yearned   they were indeed too much akin  the driftwood fire without that burned   the thoughts that burned and glowed within    devereux farm near marblehead
and then what sight pleased my heart  a girl with a big brapper letting loose a great fart
  checkd and sniffd

it all began when pat rothfuss was born to a marvelous set of parents throughout his formative years they encouraged him to do his best gave him good advice and were no doubt appropriately dismayed when he failed to live up to his full potential    in highschool pat was something of a class clown his hobbies included reading a novel or two a day and giving relationship advice to all his friends despite the fact that he had never so much as kissed a girl he also roleplayed and wrote terrible stories about elves he was pretty much a geek    most of pats adult life has been spent in the university wisconsin stevens point in 1991 he started college in order to pursue a career in chemical engineering then he considered clinical psychology in 1993 he quit pretending he knew what he wanted to do with his life changed his major to undecided and proceeded to study whatever amused him he also began writing a book    for the next seven years pat studied anthropology philosophy eastern religions history alchemy parapsychology literature and writing he studied six different martial arts practiced improv comedy learned how to pick locks and became a skilled lover of women he also began writing a satirical advice column which he continues to this day the college survivial guide through all of this he continued to work on his novel    in 2000 pat went to grad school for english literature grad school sucked and pat hated it however pat learned that he loved to teach he left in 2002 with his masters degree shaking the dust from his feet and vowing never to return during this period of time his novel was rejected by roughly every agent in the known universe    now pat teaches halftime at his old school as an assistantsublecturer he is underpaid but generally left alone to do as he sees fit with his classes he is advisor for the college feminists the fencing club and oddly enough a sorority he still rollplays occasionally but now he does it in an extremely sophisticated debonair way    through a series of lucky breaks he has wound up with the best agent and editor imaginable and the first book of his trilogy has been published under the title the name of the wind     though it has only been out since april 2007 it has already been sold in 26 foreign countries and won several awards     pat has been described as a rough earthy iconoclast with a pipeline to the divine in everyones subconscious but honestly that person was pretty drunk at the time so you might want to take it with a grain of salt
  became a skilled lover of women   christ
  eh its not that bad a bit too self aware with the self deprecation but otherwise not alright and the lover of women part is legit chummy and not as cringe as you nerds will think    and no t is not patrick it wasnt as bad/sad is i thought itd be
  i mean it becomes quickly obvious that he literally thinks of himself as the main character from the name of the wind
  thanks for posting this im sure i would never have read his shit anyway but now i have legitimate shade to throw at anyone who says they like him
  really all you have to do is post a picture of him    also i bet you he actually dyes his hair gray theres no way hes naturally graying at his age
  is that a picture of him weird how you can tell so much by just looking at a person
he looks like he retweets bacon memes and has a rollerderby gf with fat tattooed arms that larps as a game designer
  the blond white man is in the front  what did they mean by this
  unintentional humor is the best kind
bacon fried on bacon grease sandwiched between two breads made of bacon with bacon paste sauce bacon burger bacon  chug bourbon read hemmingway carouse with classy dames epic as fuck
  i wouldnt put it past him but some people start graying as early as their 30s
please dont give publicity to this retard
i remember seeing a video of a convention or something where fans were asking him questions and at one point he tells a fan hes not allowed to ask questions because hes a white male and theres been too many of them already i wish i could find it because it perfectly exposes what a piece of shit he is a guy that loves his books stood in line for at least a few hours just to ask him a question only to be rejected when the time came because of pats racism
  and not as cringe as you nerds will think  that is the cringiest sentence ive ever seen written with the second being rothfusss youre the posterchild for the dunningkruger effect dont breed i dont want my kids to have to share the world with yours do what a good little leftist like rothfuss would docrush their infant skulls in the womb with a pair of pliers and buy some cats
  well boys we have a new contender for cringiest post ever written
  quality post
  a guy that loves his books  thats what he deserved for having shit taste desu
  get rekt  race to damage control  cute now lets get back to why pat rothfuss is a hack

  too bad im going to keep posting mehim
  i dislike you
  i dont think about you at all
     try 16 mate
this is horrible and if you dont think so you need to just take my word for it amd evaluate shit again like a parody of a neckbeard bio fuck
  he could definitely be naturally graying at that age but look at the pattern and the color looks completely dyed
  i was not expecting that last comment good job anon you made me laugh heres a cookie
  this is 4channel please take this edgy attitude back to 4chan
  i must say im impressed at how quickly this 4channel meme has caught on my adblock has had no trouble blocking the retarded ads that hiro the dipshit puts on this site so i dont really notice the difference but people must be really mad at him
  i dont even use an ad blocker and i dont get ads on 4channel desu
  i was going to post dave eggers but op is a goddamn masterpiece of insufferable narcissism eggers at least had the decency to cloak it in irony and selfdeprecating humor
  set him aside for a minute who the fuck does this michiko kakutani person think she is
  michiko kakutani  apparently she used to be the chief book critic for nyt but yeah thats really weird they put her name on the cover instead of just the nyt
    they used to put her name on everything for some reason i guess because she had an exotic japanese name
  same shit with people who feel compelled to get tattoos or their septum pierced
  it makes me hate him so much mostly on account of how shitty it looks and he did it assuming it was cool
  fuck when will the world forget about this cringemaster  my faith in humanity died the day i tried reading his shitty debut novel
  is he dare i say /ourguy/ r/4channel
  kkkvothe iiisnt a self insert
  r/  christ
  in 1993 he quit pretending he knew what he wanted to do with his life changed his major to undecided and proceeded to study whatever amused him  must be nice to have a comfy bourgeois life where you can just fuck around for years with no financial consequences
  being this pretentious actually does get you laid
  tattoos  yeah i hate rednecks
the college survival guide  hes not going to make it
his first published novel was the first he ever wrote oh it shows pat it shows
  sorry bud
  got it published more than you can say
  there was a company that thought they could make money off of his book more than you can say  wow
  actually stooping to the zoomer youtube music video level retort of lmao u just mad cause they gettin money to criticism
  horrible fantasy garbage gets published  wow such an achievement
      being this mad you cant come up with a good counterargument  enjoy your poverty
  keep crying pat
  ill keep making money brandon too bad you cant say the same
  better poor than a colossal faggot desu
  t poorfag
the name of the wind was actually quite spammed here a few years ago which made me read it   i stopped halfway through the wise mans fear though because the characters are all insufferable and the plot goes everywhere its crazy theres way too many subplots and you start to wonder how on earth rothfuss is going to end this turd i guess well never know because he doesnt know it himself
      my mom started graying when she was 20
  hes sure to end it before grrm ends asoiaf
steven avery looking motherfucker
  brandon  why did you say that name
  so is the third book gonna end with the reveal that kvothe is a total sociopath who was lying about how everyone else treated him cause hes a total fucking narcissistic asshole but the narration and other characters keep treating him like hes awesome
    so hes the authors selfinsert the author does look like that type of guy is it genrefiction
idk but some author jacket cover biographies are a little too lavish    sex god john doe is the fanciest author out there if you hadnt read his latest hit walk with me youre obviously not a hip person soon to be a academy award winning movie starring teen heartthrob charlee blasé everybody except you loves him isnt that a bit weird buy it now
  muh genre fiction boogeyman when i cant even spell it correctly and put a hyphen in it for some reason  yes its genre fiction fuck off back to your philosopher threaddits
  its fantasy harry potter university in a generic dungeons  dragons world with stem magic
    english isnt my first language you dolt
  yeah that explains a lot
      i never said anything negative about genre fiction yet you became very hostile a bit defensive there buddy     also its funny that you implied i was a redditor since genre fiction is the only thing they talk about over there /lit/ used to be incredibly hostile to genre fiction a year or so ago
  if you think being published is a sign of literary merit youre not worth arguing with
    defending genre fiction
  its called having parents that love their child  you may not have had this comfy upbringing yourself but you can give it to your child and your children to their children and perhaps one day one of them will become a writer and you can claim partial credit for making that happen    or you can bitch and complain about how unfair life has been towards you and how great you could have been if only youd had parents that loved you enough to give you a comfy upbringing
  26 foreign countries  lol wtf
  unchallenged people are always dull a comfy doesnt require lazily bumming around and losing all dedication so that your crowning achievement is a halffinished fantasy series with an increasinglyhostile fanbase thatll gladly consign you to the dustbin of history
  nno you  top yikes mate
    is this post of yours going to be deleted like your previous ones
  who knows i dont particularly care what some rogue reddit janny does
  so youre just mad that he hasnt finished his story at your convenience   also if unchallenged people are always dull and patrick is an example of unchalleged because he had a comfy upbringing then how does he have fans at all    sounds to me like youre envious of his work there there it will be okay youll make it one day /snort
  then how does he have fans at all    the obvious answer would be that his fans are unchallenged too perhaps even less challenged than he was so that he seems comparatively interesting
  so youve met every single one of his fans to be able to determine that  i didnt think so  youre just assuming things    im not even that big a fan of his but its so tiresome seeing all the pretentious pseuds and desperate tryhard writers take a crap on him or any published writer for that matter when they have contributed nothing even with their noncomfy difficult lives that still hasnt managed to give them any bright ideas on what or how to write anything worth reading
  meant this  for you
  when they have contributed nothing even with their noncomfy difficult lives     in the context of modern prosperous societies difficult lives are the result of capitalism and its results eg economic exploitation unfair resource allocation etc     so i would say they their parents or grandparents have involuntarily contributed more and exactly for that reason they have difficult lives
  you are right about capitalculture having your ideas commodified leading to further degradation of culture is something worth being upset about
  nothing gets you laid you can literally do fuckall and still get laid and be ugly    and you can try really really hard and never get anything and be attractive
  at least the books were good  no
  i wish this wasnt too long to post on any board that isnt /lit/ i want to go into harry potter threads on /tv/ and post the start of the copypasta but then have it suddenly shift into rothfuss bio
based brandon sanderson
  in every single one of his pics he has that neckbeard look of disdain when judging people based on their lack of pop cultural knowledge and scifi/fantasy world lore an unfounded sense of selfimportance
  smarter than you lol
  i have no interest in anything further he might publish taking a look at what hes said online purely for schadenfreude it seems like i wont even have to abstain
  schadenfreude  you realize that schadenfreude is not when youre the one suffering
you dont have a single shred of proof of rothfusss corruption the investigation went on for half a decade and found nothing
  and you can try really really hard and never get anything and be attractive  factually incorrect
  who is eliot rodger
  are you seriously suggesting hes attractive
  hes a solid 6 or 7 physically grew up in an upper class family and his autism still got in the way in any case hes more physically attractive than lardass pat
    shut up incel
  lol settle down pat
that facial expression  he must have so much karma on reddit
  lets find out      46000 not sure how good that is but it seems pretty large like my dick
based brandon sanderson
  epic just like his books
  he wasnt complaining about his parentson not loving him you retard he was bitching about how this tool spent 10 years fucking around getting his undergrad and acts like its something everyone can do ironically rothfuss complains via his shitty selfinsert about how expensive college is while sucking academias dick
        hi patrick
  hi unsuccessful loser
  imagine being this much of an utter faggot this genuinely angers me these people are not human
  no obviously youre not a woman or yoy wouldnt say that lol that phrase changed his bio from cringey to irredeemable
  what was the purpose of the domain change so people can access parts on 4chan where it would have been blanketblocked
  its exactly this kind of person who posts about being profoundly gifted on quora whilst the term is legitimate i suspect that none of the people who claim it actually are it as they are all insufferable faggots who never manage to say anything interesting and they all assume that everyone they talk to is less intelligent than them because statistically its true  without realising that that fact is not a basis for arrogance fucking brainlets    shame because i actually want to learn about that level of intelligence    this was almost completely irrelevant but damn i hate narcissists
  merely so hiro can get more advertisers and make more money off this site advertisers are scared to advertise on 4chan because of all the porn but by splitting it into 4channel he has now created a site where they can advertise on
  grim an hiro when
  political physiognomy is a real thing
  grim and hiro was repurposed into the grim adventures of billy and mandy because hiro con carne just was not a very popular show they used the one people liked
  how did he become a skilled lover of women
  well thats easy the key is to go after fat chicks they have low self esteem
easy
he makes me biosexual
  cringe      double cringe
  i dont know who that is but i remember some kid im in a discord with posting a picture he got with him sticking his tongue out and doing the sign of the horns
  do you mean they took a picture together also that may have just been a picture of jack black
    this masturbatory elevation of ones virginhood as a man disgusts me and i say that as a 30 year old virgin if youre truly comfortable with your inexperience it is nothing you call attention to because the pity it evokes from other people will tire you out when people like rothfuss have to highlight their state of romantic pariahood its a false projection of confidence an unconvincing patina of some kind of smug antimasculinity if your intellect is really your source of stability then you dont give a shit if other people know it
  why are people obsessing so much over rothfuss when the point of the thread is to find similarly cringeworthy bios and post them good grief
    i cant bring anything that beats that and op knew what he was doing    also if you want some real laughs look up the bio pages on pornhub
  because there is no other bio cringer than rothfuss
  i couldnt handle the first book it felt like this meh meandering story that had stolen from le guin and harry potter and strung it all together with kind of random shit that just served to make the character seem cool       i cant decide if hes meant to be an unreliable narrator or if rothfuss just thinks hes clever to have a frame narrative of kvothe telling the story after the fact based on this bio and the general vibe and structure of the book i tend to think rothfuss just doesnt know what hes doing so its probably not a case of unreliable narration
  did you know that there are no female characters in the hobbit    isnt that creepy
  yes it was definitely him at a book signing or convention or something i could probably find it again
  id be interested to see it if you do
  i kinda like it
  then youd probably enjoy his book
  game grumps more like gay grumps
  i found it but i guess his fucking bio colored my memory and it wasnt nearly as dorky as i had thought sorry to disappoint  cropped it ofc
  in 1993 he quit pretending he knew what he wanted to do with his life changed his major to undecided and proceeded to study whatever amused him he also began writing a book  for the next seven years pat studied anthropology philosophy eastern religions history alchemy parapsychology literature and writing  in other words he was an unemployed neet who browsed the internet all day long     and became a skilled lover of women  sure thats why that main character in his book series is a romanticized cuck totally not reflective of the author
  guy does seem to like looking at the camera with a bemused expression like some sort of magician
i have the name of the wind in my paperwhite waiting to be read from the looks of it i put it in around the same time as drive
why are british books so much comfier than american books
hey pat how come you got so buttblasted yesterday when one qa fan made a single lukewarm snipe about you taking forever with your book
  what happened was there a con yesterday
  it wasnt the best book i ever read but it was still good  this thread seems a tad upset and pretentious
  a tad upset and pretentious  that could pretty much be the tagline for /lit/
    pax unplugged in philadelphia    for those of you who dont know rothfuss does dnd with the penny arcade guys his character is a redheaded bard who is a constant flirt yeah kvothe is totally not an archetype of vicarious escapism
  ive got to hear rothfuss roleplay flirting the thought of it with his voice is hilarious
zankoku na tenshi no you ni
isnt his review of his own book on good reads the first review or so that you see on the books page
      timestamp of the buttblasting
  its not the first but it is there    absolutely fucking based name one other author who has the balls to not only review his own book but give it five stars
pat
pat
mat
good man
he is awesome
brandon please
thanks for that this finally convinced me to never read any of his books
    loads of authors on goodreads do this
    its pretty pathetic though but well who am i to judge the published author
  its just fucking goodreads its not like its some respected database of literary criticism its a fucking hobby site
yeah
yep
this ones going in the collection
you now realize you share this board with someone who goes around posting cringe memes in every thread
yeah boy
blaze it
praise it
im honestly confused as to how any one who was rejected from cambridge/oxford/harvard/mit/stanford could possibly claim to intelligent    like dude youre literally not even in the top 1 if you failed to get into a top 5 university
  claim to intelligent
  trying to excuse that as a typo  lol
  its called taking stimulants they make you type fast and skip words suck on it dork
  i literally cant express how much better my life has been since i attended oxford i went to a state school and gradually became the stereotypical moody withdrawn sensitive type who both despises the quality of his immediate culture and feels a weird pride for having been raised in a sort of antiintellectual and brutal environment i was all set to take my russell group humanities ba and spend my life working as an anonymous insecure wageslave forever thankful of being offered a job and forever too insecure to pursue my creative ambitions the chip on my shoulder had become something of a wedge and i felt too out of place regardless of my environment too resentful and bitter to even attempt to make it in the artistic world then i finally applied for oxford and got in to study an english ma with reassurance that should i work hard enough a career in academia or within one of oxfords affiliated companies would be almost guaranteed i turned up as apprehensive as usual and the first few days were spent regretting my decision and desperately feigning a cultured personality but then i realized that the people there were just interesting and that the snobbery and exclusivity i had anticipated was just a myth borne out of my working class upbringing ive since graduated having spend the year dining in grand halls with groups of interesting people dating several girls one of whom a petite russian whose family traces back to the aristocracy is now my fiancee i work four days a week at a publishing company and earn 38k a year i regularly meet up with friends from my college and visit oxford for nights out and for meetings with my professors the martin edenesque novel i have been writing for two years has been selected for publication at a major british publishing house and honestly i could not have imagined a few years ago how great life could be i come on /lit/ and see how pathetic you all are and just shake my head and chuckle if i saw you guys on the street i would of course throw you a penny or discuss bukowski or whatever realist writers you enjoy but ultimately i would be able to tell within ten seconds if youre an oxbridge grad and would dismiss you as a potential source of good company if you are not i never thought id know what it was like to be objectively better than somebody else for the value of my existence to be superior to the value of a strangers but now i do and ive never been happier people are awed by power and prestige all i need to do is mention the university i attended if only for a year and they immediately begin to hunch and look at their feet because they know they are in the presence of greatness
  oh so youre a druggie makes it easier to disregard you
  drinks cup of coffee  le druggie bad  are you 12
  le  yikes reddit much
  my friend was significantly gray in high school dude
    what kind of faggot could refer to drinking a coffee as taking a stimulant and then accuse the other party of being dumb for misunderstanding them    i just got done gorging myself on incomplete protein chains  what  obviously i was eating peanut butter you ignoramus
  lmao made me laugh im actually on modafinil but the point still stands you cant accuse someone of being a druggie for simply having consumed a psychoactive drug
  i bet you arent even aware of the dangers of dihydrogen monoxide
    if life is like that for you why are you on /lit/ at all
  not instantly assuming that is a copypasta  seriously
  in the first book name of the wind it looked like kvothe was a blowhard if not sociopathic burnout who bullshitted his way to fame and then somehow blew it many were intrigued by the concept the second book wise mans fear revealed that no kvothefuss really is just that awesome    ten years later the third book in the trilogy is unpublished rothfuss has blamed the mental anguish of trumps election for this although allegedly his editor rejected a completed manuscript
  rothfuss has blamed the mental anguish of trumps election for this  feel free to provide a source for this that isnt your ass
  through a series of lucky breaks he has wound up with the best agent and editor imaginable and the first book of his trilogy has been published under the title the name of the w  i would say wants to be i dont think he thinks he is actually kvothe
  ng profoundly gifted on quora whilst the term is legitimate i suspect that none of the people who claim it actually are it as they are all insufferable faggots who never manage to say anything interesting and they all assume that everyone they talk to is less intelligent than them because statistically its true  without realising that that fact is not a basis for arrogance fucking brainlets  shame because i actually want to learn about that level of intelligence  this was almost completely irrelevant but damn i hate narcissists  he talks about all the things hes studied but he never finished anything
  finished a buffet probably
  what
    youre right anon its just a particularly artful piece of larping that actually got me
what are some essays/books about how technology makes the act of recording an event arguably more important than the event itself ie the cultural shift toward valuing imagery  emotion over reality  logic
what am i looking at here
literally anything about mindfulness
  burn burn yes you gotta burn
  protestors in boston burning a confederate flag
  the act of recording an event arguably more important than the event itself  ie the cultural shift toward valuing imagery  emotion over reality  logic  i dont see the equivalence
  how it can be more effective to promulgate an image that strikes an emotional chord even if the event the event the image is portraying wasnt at all significant when described in plain language for example
  the possibility of thing ie the cultural shift towards thing
  lets say the possibility of thing and the cultural shift toward seizing upon that possibility does that make sense
  no one has mentioned the society of the spectacle yet
this guys forehead looks like a funny face
  squawwwk
the entire academic discipline known as media theory and a good portion of cultural criticism/theory as well all of the following have extreme leftwing bias and is better read as theory fiction    the media equation  social media  the first 2000 years  the mediation of power  evil media  stenographers to power  manufacturing consent  media control  the gutenberg galaxy  the reality of the mass media  almost anything by baudrillard  anything by friedrich kittler  
whats the best rebuttal to this      i was considering thomas pikkety capital in the 21st century
so are you just arranging books you havent read into these rebuttal chains or what
marx
  that actually would be cool if someone made them who actually read them
is google and wikipedia broke    
  im a quarter of the way through pic related i recognize rebuttal isnt the right word i guess just a leftist equivalent
  are you drunk whats your fucking question try to formulate it as a complete sentence that implies roughly what you would prefer as a response
  im just trying to learn things
how about reading some textbooks instead of meme ideological trash for partisan retards    if your economics book doesnt have math ignore it
  tell me more
it should be debunking itself if the very premise of basic economics being something so simple it can be condensed into a pop book where it so neatly fits into the ideology of its author is so blatantly intellectually insincere i dont really know where anyone could even start it doesnt help that much of the basic economics of sowell and co is 40 years past its expiration date protip the majority of actual contemporary economists tend to be keynesians somewhere between socialliberals and outright socialdemocrats not friedmanite free marketeers    basically  except not at all textbook economics is godawful and even more divorced from reality than usual learning economics youll be spending your entire time in graduate school learning how everything youve been taught in undergrad school is trash also math is a cancer onto economics and the only reason economists ever use it beyond simple statistics 101 concepts is to hide ridiculous illogical trash    if you simply must have someone spell things out for you try keens debunking economics its not as allencompassing as some of the ideological trash coming out of the lolbritarian right and it doesnt have all the answers but thats precisely the point  economics is a dismal science all we really know is how little we actually know if someone comes along and insists everything can be reduced to an uncomplicated free market good government bad or vice versa formula be extremely suspicious    jacobinmag also published an essay about the state of macroeconomics just the other day you may want to check it out 
also i suggest you read let it bleed not exactly economics but a wonderfully thorough essay nonetheless its about the standard rightlibertarian idea of liberty just what the fuck does it mean specifically at the workplace     and as long as were posting shitty thirdtier blogs try reading through stumbling and mumbling its written by some fat ugly british hedge fund manager with a marxist leanings but hot damn if the guy isnt one of the most intellectually sharp without being boring the economic left currently has its downright criminal how littleknown the guy is
  math is cancer   the absolute state kys fuvking pseud
    wow thanks
  youre incredibly rude do you come on here to vent
what the fuck was he talking about anyway
  a reversal of culture to appease an unkind god and let us all off on guilt though that will be clearly specified in order that your real desire for transgression is satisfied
money has nothing to do with human beings    i repeat    money has nothing to do with human beings    mostly

  this is an idiotic post im leaving forever
capital is sentient    based
  political quietism in le epic transhumanist jargon
  is he lovecrafts illegitimate descendant
  most of his works are really just attempts to describe and explain the plot of twin peaks the return years before it was even in production
does anyone else collect his oracular utterances    neither cosmopolitanism or parochialism is the kind of value likely to be casually amenable to correction or to be considered negotiable on either side its an opportunity for diversity
  keep thinking this is ted bundy
  who is this sperm worm
as soon as i stopped trying to understand accelerationism as a political movement and instead just an application of the concept of the transcendental in kantian to what marx describes materialistically then it kinda just makes sense   theres no need to get emotional about a guy using various elusive philosophical terms invented in the 100 years to reflect on cybernetics

  thanks ive been parodying poetry for years whenever i see a share your poetry thread on /lit/ i pick a poet to imitate and start improvising a lot of those poems have even received praise

  what is it with public figures being so aggressively mediocre in their tastes    truly we are living in the kali yuga
    basically because they are trying to cater to a illiterate audience its more marketing than anything do you really think a billionaire would waste his time reading all that shit
why should i care about what some random billionaire reads

what does /lit/ think about putnams paradox
  realism bad pragmatism good
  didnt know about it sounds really interesting thanks anon
reality dont real lmao  stop doing science lmao    putnam was born in chicago illinois in 1926 his father samuel putnam was a scholar of romance languages columnist and translator who wrote for the daily worker a publication of the american communist party from 1936 to 1946 when he became disillusioned with communism24 as a result of his fathers commitment to communism putnam had a secular upbringing although his mother riva was jewish7    the putnams rebelling against the antisemitism that they had experienced during their youth decided to establish a traditional jewish home for their children28 since they had no experience with the rituals of judaism they sought out invitations to other jews homes for seder they had no idea how to do it themselves in the words of ruth anna they therefore began to study jewish ritual and hebrew and became more jewishly interested identified and active in 1994 hilary putnam celebrated a belated bar mitzvah service his wife had a bat mitzvah service four years later28    it really make grug think
  cringe
  decided to establish a traditional jewish home for their children  based and tekheletpilled
  reality dont real lmao  stop doing science lmao  if thats really what you took home from the paradox you have no business opining on anything
psa  if youre interested in sincere discussion and wish to avoid the torrent of verbal diarrhea that accompanies most threads on this board i suggest creating an op that poses specific questions preferably including big technical words that dont activate babbies almonds thus allowing the thread to go unnoticed by the masses
  so only indoctrinated people would participate  thats even worse
  indoctrinated  indoctrinated in the art of sincere good faith discussion that would be pretty sweet actually  on that note what sort of background do you need to understand putnams thesis i looked it up and it reminds me of stuff ive read but mostly forgotten in logic and philosophy of language
  hillary is a girls name
peirce rolls over in his grave and cringes
how are you supposed to empirically verify the intention of others to come out right does that mean the same thing as intention to be correct when arguing    what sorts of statements/arguments/theories are we talking about op surely not all statements formable in human language im not familiar but now im intrigued what is an empirically ideal theory for example    this paper seems like an absolute mess from the start
  if only the linguistic turn was the semiotic turn instead
  smart people know when youre stupid and pretending to be smart so whats the point
  okay bub go ahead and explain to me how you know
  because you made a tangential reference to peirce rather than commenting on either lewis or hillary and especially rather than commenting on the ops pic suggesting you grabbed the first thing in your mind you considered relevant to the topic at hand then packaged it in a suposedly opinionated peirce disagrees you say but completely ambiguous with putnam or lewis single line post    what do you think of putnams paradox  what do you think peirce would think of putnams paradox
  i dont know anything about putnams paradox and only know lewis from the sep article about modal logic and modal realism he is brilliant from what i can tell  peirce spent a life time developing a phenomenonology and sign logic that glues ideas to their referrants in an ireducible way and specifically renamed his pragmatism pragmaticism because people who adopted the name treated ideassigns for peirce as a product of intentionality instead of the producers of intention this rends a nominalistic pragmatism that is totally different from that of peirce who spent his life vehemently opposing nominalism and advocating for his kind of schoolastic realism   you dont know shit and only an arrogant dickwad would make that kind of conclusion from such an utterance you need to be really stupid to think yourself smart enough to make that sort of conclusion from such a vacous premise i am smarter than you if only by the fact that i know how stupid i am
  okay thank you yes that was arrogant to post based on so little information you win 4 channels    glues ideas to their referrants in an ireducible way    so wouldnt that be the heart of the matter as regards op is this just an argument over peirce    i wish op would post page 2 etc
    wait on second reading of your post i stand by my first post completely
  yes i find myself reinterperting alot of the analytic stuff i read in light of peirces semiotics and phareonscopy    this doesnt help you seem smart i myself am very uncertain about a couple things i said in that post think things through man
    weird we both reacted to what we perceived as someone being smarter than us by demonstrating humility     i understood op as a challenge to the board as in lol none of these people will understand this its so technical so i applied myself to reading it and became curious in the process then i read through the thread and found exclusively meme tier responses and i picked yours as a particular example of what i was observing     whats your story show me your hand pal
  you little philosophy minoring bitch
  i hate your guts fight me like a man
  i havent been to college    id hurt ya    i saw the thread in the catalog and was wanted to know what the thread was about  then i read this cringey worthy post and became disgruntled after that i read the picture and thought about how badly peirce is missed i definitely didnt feel like going into it so i just made a shit post then this fucking guyou came along
  okay you asked not me what kind of guy reads about peirce for kicks
interesting discussion

machiavelli was a hack  i wonder how the fuck this asshole earned so much notoriety
  a hack explain
everything by heidegger desu
  even though his political analysis may seem relevant nowadays on his time he was a mock to everyone else including to médici himself which kept his book gathering dust until someone actually discovered overall even though he founded the political science his work did not add much for his time and was only taken seriously by future generations
  thinking machiavelli moved political philosophy from ought to is is the most pleb reading of il principi stop talking about shit you know nothing about
  thinking machiavelli moved political philosophy from ought to is is the most pleb reading of il principi  i havent said that actually the opposite i said he didnt do shit and thats why hes a hack
  so youre just quoting people without knowing what they are saying  what does he founded the sic political science mean  he didnt do shit theoretically then besides the fact that you are contradicting yourself he founded political science but he did nothing and also reducing actual work or doing shit to being recognised by your peers which i hope dont have to argue against because its a new low    if by doing shit you mean being active politically that he was thought he was pragmatic enough not to be killed he also wrote acclaimed works of history and plays acclaimed by his peers in his time so you just generally dont know wtf youre talking about
  why did i even try
    this is true im not even american
  this is true im not even american  please elaborate
i just took a mega dump and then like ten minutes later my roommate sprayed air freshener out the door make noise at 3am expect turds
    its so strange but what the guy said is exactly how it works in countries where most of our television movies and music comes from america we have adopted the sort of guiding question idea where a question not only serves to get an answer but as a sort of medium where you can drive or manipulate the conversation/person and especially when your views disagree or differ but imo it also seems to happen subconsciously as well     this is especially true in discussions which are huge topics with many working parts    that is just my opinion you see it differently

bump anyone read heidegger on technology
  yes its good though not as indepth as some of his other works his book on the grundsatz is much better at exploring the theme of ratio in the western metaphysical tradition i think he is inspired by nietzsche here as the very principle of casualty is under attack by heidegger in this work
do u know мeтpo  if u do what do u think about the book  do u like it 
amongst my favourite books of all time
  ive read it when i was 12 i liked it but only first novel 2034 was trash and 2035 wasnt even trash level
i want to read it but i heard the english translations were garbage
  really that sucks i was thinking of getting it for my brother for christmas since he likes video games
  you shouldnt decide to not get it just based off what i heard itd probably be better to ask someone that has read them
ive been playing the pc game the past few days with an xbox 360 controller    its pretty good    cant say about the book tho
read 2033 and finished it out of boredom tried again with 2034 and abandoned it by page 100

some obscure hermeticist or alchemist writer from a previous century    theres some massive archiveorg page with tons of uploads of alchemy books from the 1500s  1800s
  you wouldnt happen to have a link would you sounds great
  implying grimes being involved with something meaning its dead    not that accelerationism is actually that substantial or viable its mostly edgy larping and not even like the freshest or most relevant thing most accelerationist larpers probably have just discovered dg which is really yesterdays news by now
  here you go man          id suppose one might want to do some research into whats actually in there although i suppose it would reward digging for stuff that doesnt have much attention or wikis yet    also i imagine theres probably much more compelling material here than any silliness from any of crowleys followers or golden dawn related writers all of which i kind of just see as a corruption by now
  thanks a bunch this is incredible

  is an accelerationist just a neocommunist
  essentially yesno
  yes a communist who supports capitalism to achieve fascist ends
  can you point to a few examples
  yes but capitalism is the good guy rather than the worker it seeks to end modernity by letting it finish its own ends so that we can have xenofascism
    no this was a misreading maybe ten years ago presumed by one or two people because people just presume that academic theorymongers are going to be communist and communismintentioned or even leftist at all whereas the actual truth of accelerationist thought and any actual representation of people into it right now is just postleftist dg types kind of just affirming desire and growth initself without former leftist concern for praxis see also libidinal economy or then just straight up cryptotech fascists and hardcore right wing capitalists and transhumanists     the idea of going through capitalism to achieve marxist ends is another thing and originates in marx himself this idea that communism needed capitalisms productivity and innovation to lay out the infrastructure which can then be used for communism but there is no necessary desire for this among people of other leanings who embrace extreme disruptive even antihumanistic technoeconomic developments     but even further out than this not everyone who is smart but actually not critically posed against capitalism or always trying to critique it are necessarily being accelerationist either thats again kind of a leftist presumption that stil presumes some kind of leftist excuse for just you know not caring or complying with or existing in a system like there has been a long tradition in fine arts of being uncritical of the mainstream or of capitalism or the market or whatever this strain has nothing to do with any accelerationist lineage its simply the fact that a lot of artists are apolitical or perfectly fine with considering the market dimensions to an artwork and its context without condemning it with marxist critique
 isnt this just communism  communism cant work with basic math and game theory so no

  accelerationism is finally dead  according to whom
  grimes has brought acceleration to its telos as mere aesthetic for music videos and nick land has become a georgist christian pacifist
  i think we should all read spengler and take him to the ultimate memetic conclusion until spenglerian facebook meme pages start spawning and every zoomer want second religiousness and caesarism to arrive
  until spenglerian facebook meme pages start spawning and every zoomer want second religiousness and caesarism to arrive    wasnt that just the 2015/16 vibe around the trump election and fashy goy ride the tiger facebook

  he kickstarted philosophy of religion and american psychology he taught the first psychology class in america wrote perhaps the first good psychology textbook and still readable today not bland at all principles of psychology invented the term stream of consciousness although mostly forgotten by nonacademics he is much more a father to modern psychology than freud who was not only after james and partially derivative from james but who has also been largely departed from unlike james james influence is also palpable in the american 1960s/70s psychedelic movement if you know him well and look closely john deweys work is largely his own extension of jamesian thought oliver sacks is in the same sort of jamesian camp too which is obvious in his hallucinations and river of consciousness gabriel marcel and jeanpaul sartre were avid readers of james    etc

  denial skepticism  i could see it as denial but it might also be acceptance  the whole problem with this categorization huh  anger empiricism  i thought about putting an empiricist for anger because fragmentation separation etc anger was the hardest one for me to decide an example of at first i was thinking maybe machiavelli  its difficult for me to find thinkers who are what i would consider angry so i went with the closest one i could think of  radical separation is very closely akin to hatred hence descartes   bargaining rationalism  reasonable   depression romanticism  yep i see that i could conceivably put it as denial also and some people would make arguments for it being transcendent  acceptance lebensphilosophie  fine placement you could probably also put most aristotelians here  transcendence pragmaticism  nice

  next step is going back to /v/
start with the greeks  this is like telling someone wishing to learn about biology to start with the fossils   nah that is telling someone wishing to study biology to start with the fossils   philosophy is a living thing and you can only understand it as such
  the greeks
  i know this is bait but philosophy is a constructed western discourse that originated in classical greece you can ignore its roots at your own peril but at the very least you are missing out on a lot
  american football was constructed in the american discourse that originated in early 20th century america you can ignore its roots and watch the game at your own peril but at the very least you are missing out on alot
  its not bait either i started with contemporary philosophy and it worked out great the only downside is i am forced to focus on the truth of ideas relevant to the living philosophical sciences and miss out on psued posturing about long dead ideas
  it worked out great  describe what you mean by this
  philosophy is like a sports game  why has god created someone so dumb
  yeah go on and start with the fossils
everyone in this thread besides me is dumb af    you can all suck my dick as far as im concerned
  nah youre the dumbest youre gay too
  i can understand and engage with philosophy which is the ultimate goal of all those poor souls who are unfortunate enough to be dogmatically taught philosophy starting with the greeks the path of inquiry should not be blockaded by ancient greece
  i laugh at you if you were to say that to me in real life i would clean your clock you are a coward and an incel to boot
  they are both living things like all living things they live hic et nunc
  you wouldnt even be able to make eye contact with me much less lay a hand on me youre so weak i wont read further replies from you because you are incoherent and i am busy making business moves
  miss out on psued posturing about long dead ideas  this is the result of taking modern philosophers views of ancient philosophy at face value
  busy making your boipussy move up and down on my dick you are a catamite unworthy of even licking by shitty sweaty balls were this a different time i would enslave your entire family for you temerity in replying to me i have no doubt this is the highlight of your life being spoken to by one such as me is like being addressed by a god
  sure you can watch the game but you wont understand a lot of it you will miss why they have those rules the rankings the prestige and all the history that finally led in to that moment where you will only see lol they throw a ball    its the same if you read thou spoke zaratustra as your first philosphy book you will only see a lot of words and reference you dont know scrambled around while making your own indivual distortion of what it means by thw way how you think i ber you dont have a problem with this and will say ur dur i totally understood everything becuz im so smart but the sad reality is that you missed 9999 of how the book should be understood
  then what is the alternative honest question
  based narcissistic sociopath poster
  im with you here unless you have an explicit interest in reading old greek texts there is no reason to dogmatically start with them theres good books that summarize the greeks in a very understandable manner
the greeks are fucking great regardless
  why do i pronounce 4channel as 4chanel makes no sense
  agreed the greeks is the way to go plato and aristotle are both immensely enjoyable reads
you have a greater appreciation for how the ideas and arguments are built from when you start from the origins theres a reason why western philosophy is a series of footnotes from plato because his ideas are critical to its foundations
it is a living thing and it has its roots in a tradition which is precisely why you should start with the greeks the greeks arent dead theyre still very much alive
  last great philosophers imho  nietzschekept asking why are the greeks so beautiful  heideggersaid only greeks really experienced language closest we can get is to study etymologies  derridaplatos pharmakon is central
  yeah analogies have rules and the greeks arent fossils  when americans studied the greeks some students thought they were contemporaries and said mr socrates  yes they werent raised in european culture  but they took socrates seriously
i think the greeks suck
  yea right reading euclids elements is the best way to learn geometry and aristoles de anima physics and prior analytics is where one should start learning about theorhetical biology physics and philsophical logic nah fuck that you need to get horizontal rather than vertical my dude nietzsche is a horrible place to start with philosophy start with a systematic philospher whos philosophy is coherent with the facts we know about the natural world like peirce or hiedegger contemporary pure math philosophical logic and natural science are the backbone of a good education in philosophy  while making your own indivual distortion of what it means  no you you are the arrogant one for believing you can learn from a dead discourse of course i think historical philosophy is important for inspiration and an undergraduate of the development of ideas speculative philosophy is a positive science of ideas that does not depend on any natural contextlike history save for epistomological tests relevant historical ideas are immortal and will carry on in the living community of philosophy that isnt to say you cant learn anything from history im saying you cant learn anything from being taught history the dogma of the dead is the reason why great systematic philosophists are so rare it kills speculation its why impotent acedemic philosophy becomes evermore compartmentalized into niche studies   by thw way how you think i ber you dont have a problem with this and will say ur dur i totally understood everything becuz im so smart but the sad reality is that you missed 9999 of how the book should be understood  cope i understand when i dont understand something and that gives me freedom to inquire and learn there is a big difference between being taught and educated and being learned and erudite you can keep your degenerate dogma of the dead i will take the scientific approach to philosphy the the premises of the logical inferences made by the greek are no longer true have fun wasting your precious time following inquiries into change that dont hold up after newton inquires into space and time that dont hold up after einstein inquires into the nature of truth and logical inferences that dont hold up after godel  im so disgusted by these acedemic npc philistines im way too freaking smart
  undergraduate of the development of ideas  meant to say understanding lol
  at marathon persia had a force twice that of the athenians the persians on their ships watched as the athenian soldiers in full armor ran a mile toward the beach to meet the invasion  nietzsche the greeks were so beautiful
  nietzsche means nothing to me
  
  yeah but you recommend heidegger who loved the greeks
    you sound like a weak nerd
  actually that wasnt me i only recommend hiedegger because he seems like the sort of philosopher i am talking about and i think diversity is of prime importance i recommend peirce who also loved the greeks but not as much as he loved the schoolastics he and whitehead are the only ones of that class i have so far engaged with niet seems cool hes just not the sort of philosopher id recommend starting with
  he hasnt its bait
  did you post the wikipedia pederasty link
  maybe
  fun fact euclids elements is the second book in history that has been printed more times only second to the bible  you have to go horizontal not vertical my dude  you look like a baby you have to go diagonal lol or are you too dumb   but i get your point you take into philosophie in the pragmatic way of though in this case i dont only recommend you to skip the greeks but skip most of literature and philosophie and only read scientific essays and authors authorized by le neyl degreasse tyson  in the greek way philosophie is the love for knowledge and as such it doesnt follow the pragmatic aproach for its most precius value is beauty  you will never inherit the great spirit of the west that lives in poetry and lit instead you will inherith the western suicide   shouldnt you be in sci instead of lit
  start with anything people who say the greeks are fucking pseuds

  yea i prefer to side with the nobel prize winners horizontal baby boi
  look at this philistine that doesnt know the sublime ecstasy of a scientific explanation most of your understanding of science comes from popular science communicators like ndt lol you sound like an evolatard and i have much more in common with the great greek philosophists than you ever will the greeks were but an early instars of the divine and immoratal class of scientists working with primitive methodologies you dont understand the greeks and you dont understand philosophy it isnt wisdom that the philosophists in the socratic tradition love actually wisdom was a thing to be hated socrates died a marytr in the fight against wisdom and platos acedemy and all subsquent philosophy is a reaction against the supposed wisdom of myth and tradition it is the pursuit of wisdom inquiry that is the love of philosophy idiot
  holy shit youre dumb
the greeks are genuinely great and im glad i fell for the meme i dont understand how anyone with an actual interest in philosophy could read plato and just think its dead ideas with no value
  oh so youre actually retarded
  wow somebody got mad  diagonal baby not horizontal  do you get it or do i have to draw a graphic for you    wisdom is tradition  lol i said knowledge baby but anyways i already told you if your objetive is to get off at ndy and bill nye then skip everything you dont need the greeks for that you dont have to feel threatened and lose your shit lol    pd diagonal remember that
  good response y
  euclids elements is a must read    no so much with aristotles de anima though
  i never said i didnt appreciate the grreks i said its a terrible place to start philosophy architecture is built from a foundation people dont first come to appreciate the beauty and purpose of a building by starting their analysis at its foundation and reasoning how it was built step by step until they get the big picture what strikes you first is how the building lives here and now thats such an obstacle and you miss the importance of its historical development if you dont grasp it as a living entity what i think may be true about mereological phenomena is that parthood is given by relationships of wholeness and not the other way around if you start with the greeks the whole of your philosophy will be the greeks if you start with how philosophy lives here and now you will be free to inquire into any part of it in relation to the life of philosophy as a whole
  heres a real great professor psychology and his conclusion is aristotle has the best understanding of human psychology  
while greek classics are in some ways necessary to grasp a whole lot to entire western philosophical discourse the idea that you have to start at the root to get everything is based on the assumption that you can get everything this mirage of complete encylopedic knowledge so that theres nothing you can miss about anything a sort of nerdy enlightenment     if people get interested in phliosophy theyll know the greeks in time probably even more nuancedly and poignantly so that someone with zero prior knowledge of philsophy or its history start from an author or a topic that interests you study them study some secondary literature babout their works get introduced to the works theyre responding to little by little and go from there
  ptss diagonal
  why the opinion i hear from professional mathematicians is that it is profuse with bad reasoning and shouldnt be read unless you can deal with that you certainly dont need to read it to understand geometry
  lol youre being scamed boi ask for your money back
theres no such thing as a must read
  iliterate razionalization    do you know where i got that word from reading lol
  i can only speak for biology as thats ostensibly my field though once you reach postdoc or even as early as postgrad it generally all becomes biochemistry that gets done rather than micro or clinical biology    youre right starting with the fossils is stupid you should start with the three central dogmas in biology  the cell  the dnarnaprotein mechanism  natural selection  these three theories underpin our entire understanding of biology and a holistic understanding of the subject is impossible without understand all three to a competent degree    in much the same way you shouldnt start from a singular and ultimately myopic view of philosophy but rather you should start from the foundational tenets like i said im a biologist not a philosopher so im not an authority on what those would be but i imagine it would be something like  logic  ethics  metaphysics  aesthetics  epistemology  they should be understood in concert much like the three key theories in biology in order to understand the subject as a whole and draw connections between them
  to bad you spelled it wrong
  english is not my native lenguage    still i can read your shitty opinions and you want to know how did you got mine by reading faggit lol
  do retarded analogies always flood your retarded mind
  i would it helps with logic reasoning everything lord knows the only people you talk to are the retards on this site    euclids elements helps you reason its a must read historically as well
  lol i said knowledge baby  i know what you said stupid i was doing you a flavor by not going into semantics sophia is the greek word for both knowledge and wisdom and philosophy literally translates tothe love of wisdom so you are wrong on multiple fronts most importantly you dont understand what philosophy is or its historical context
  i was doing you a flavor  yeah youre salty lol    anyway i know youre a troll or a retard either way i already stopped taking you seriously your post are great for laughing but bad for learning or discussing    lets close this useless conversation by sayin diagonal just go diagonal baby    youre welcome
  i think a soild survey of the diversity of life is very important i think a soild knowlege of taxonomy and a good background of everything thing you mentioned  the rudimentary knowlege we have of ecological relationships and evolutionary processes that arent natural selection is very important in other words i say that the foundation for a comprehensive study of biology or more accurately life science ought to be systematics not to mention math logic and philosophy which are so infuriatingly pushed to the background  anyways i think philosophy should have its foundation in pure math natural science and logic then in order of primitivity phenemonology philosophical logic/ethics/aesthetics epistomology/philosophy of science then metaphysics where the best place to start this is a difficult question which is why i recommend starting at the most systematic and contemporary applicable philosophers and continuing your learning from there filling in the ideaological blanks and moving into more nuanced studies
philosophy is a historical process best understood as such
   well when plato socrates and aristotle are still incredibly relevant today and their ideas are the foundation of western society if you cant comprehend them how do you plan on comprehending anyone who came after its like trying to learn multiplication before addition
  like  said it helps with logic and reasoning i was first exposed to proofs and proper mathematical reasoning when i read it
  it even helps you with contemporary mathematics as well though you read euclid you can understand mathematicians like von neumann better especially von neumann since he works with euclidean space frequently to explain concepts
  this desu i stopped watching scientific documentaries ever since i wasted 2 hours watching one only to find out a couple of months later that a more updated version came up cant even imagine how all the people whove seen planet documentaries with pluto in it felt like

  its just an observation im calling you dumb so that everyone watching this understands what a very dumb person looks like
  whats he supposed to prove wrong that you stopped watching documentaries youre even dumber than he assumed
  so you assume everyone else is too dumb to form their own opinions and try to paint the post in a certain light to help them better identify what reaction they should have when reading it without actually debunking the argument or giving any reason thats very altruistic of you if only we had some sort of system where several people could do that and filter content for the rest of us something like a rating system with arrows where you could award or subtract points
  lol forgot your brain on your mothers womb      no need for that since its so evident but anyway its good to point it out
  youre so weak i wont read further replies from you because you are incoherent and i am busy making business moves  im gonna steal this
  appreciate the beauty  what strikes you first  if youre looking to be struck by beauty then the deepest you should go into philosophy is wikiquotes intuition is not a path into understanding any philosopher
  its like trying to learn multiplication before addition  more like learning fucking calc before addition     some of these guys are incomprehensible without some sort of background
  it was a syllogism about architecture you freaking dink      its more like learning how to ride a bike without training wheels youll freaking cowards its not very hard in my experience of course you are going to wander into pitfalls at first but as long as you keep thinking and learning about what you are thinking about it is not very hard its better to know that you dont understand something studying redundant and incoherent theories is the more arduous route and it doesnt give nearly the same benefit for time spent yes studying philsophy is hard especially metaphysics as long as you keep your stupidity in mind and realize that your ideas are probably wrong you are going to progress quickly and will soon be able to play the game with the big boys if you cant do this then philosophy may not be your thing
  sportsball  pseud latin phrases
  philosophy isnt a living tradition and is much closer to a fossil than an organism you self owning brainlet

i lost my virginity to a whore   2016 i guess   havent fucked since then  convince me not to waste money on this again /lit/
this board is better if you block thumbnails with your ad blocker
  i know a guy who lost his virginity to a whore around 2016 and havent fucked since then what a faggot dont be like him
  convince me not to be a hedonist  doesnt work like that go ahead and throw away more of your life and money on worthless pursuits due to your inability to control yourself you might as well up the ante and start using opiates
  start using opiates  dont do that you wont be ableor willing to fuck whores
  just do it lol conceptualize your death  the world around you slowly fading the end of the trip  and in that moment youll see how petty your concerns seem right now
  who cares its blind hedonism in either case
  first day of nofap  note not to browse the internet if you wish to avoid stimuli

  are you a monk or some shit its just 1 one little fuck and were golden
  i know nothing  not even what im gonna do tomorrow
  how much did you pay was she young and pretty
  try to get laid for free at a club or some shit first what do you have to lose
  his dignity and selfworth
  got sore throat  i hate it  i dont enjoy eating and it distracts me  not to mention the pain  it also lasts all winter ffs
  anon why are you doing it there is no point just masturbate less
  it didnt just happen someone is to blame  i hate idiots who get me sick i think it should be illegal to go out in public whether to work or store whilst sick and you should face steep civil penalties quarantine and possibly jail time for doing so i hate most people when theyre sick they think theyre going to miss out on something and wont cancel any social affairs ive terminated friendships before simply because someone showed up with a cold and later got me sick  yyeah bro im not contagious trust me  its almost a violation of the nap get the fuck back leper
  i paid something close to 80 usd   she wasnt young more like a milf i couldnt know at the time because i found her through newspaper ads      im too autistic for clubs trust me
  this year my familly planned to reunite with some friends for christmas eve  the son of this family friends is an asshole and always brags about about how much money he makes and how many bitches he slept with  glad that faggot was robbed last week he begged for it dressing like some actor
  i mean not like he had much to begin with
  i wouldnt do it again anon
americans are such pussies lets peacefully protest that will change everything    look at france right now they are rioting over shitty neoliberalism i hope they go further and hang the rich or guillotine them again
  anon why are you doing it there is no point  of course there is a point sexual activity incurs a neuro/endocrinal/physiological costs abstaining from it forgoes this penalty and yields immense benefits for some people it also makes your mind more inclined to obey reason rather than be a slave to constant and never ending calls for pleasure   if you better understood abstinence you would observe how there is a hormonal rebound following breaks of even moderate stretches of abstinence which makes masturbating less often more difficult than stopping entirely
  i want to start practicing a sport again  not too sure what tho  nothing that involves teams tho maybe swimming
  i wonder if i talk weird or something  people often laugh or smirk when i talk for long maybe its just me being paranoic  hope im not weird
  fencing never practiced it always wanted to give it a try but just assumed it was expensive and only accessible to the bourgeoisie
i saw a reference to a site called the modern word whilst reading ancient wordpress blog but it doesnt seem to be online anymore    after a bit of digging i was able to find it on the wayback machine  and its actually brilliant     its a fascinating collection of resources on authors like eco/borges/pynchon from the early days of the modern internet think early 2000s a shame that its gone but i thought /lit/ might be interested in what is preserved by the archive nevertheless
  nice
  you gain superpowers if you dont touch yourself  lel
  sexual activity is a biological free lunch  lel
  so you shouldnt exercise either to avoid spending calories and sweat you have any idea of how retarded that sounds
  you admit the cost and yet still deny that abstaining would potentially be beneficial just as it is inopportune to exercise before a meeting in a suit or wear yourself out from doing it too much the same could be said for the ad libitum indulgence in masturbation or sex you ignore logical conclusion that if it did incur a cost then by extension abstinence would be valuable    sexual activity affects the body in more ways than practically any other action the sex act masturbation included from arousal to ejaculation to habituation has chilling physiological repercussions endocrinology and neuroscience show that shy of drugs no other action affects the body so much so suddenly hormones neurotransmitters are all profoundly affected upon arousal dopamine is released not only in the capacity of motivating you as would be the impetus for wanting to grab that needle of heroin but you are biologically rewarded just for the mere image of arousal  then sexual stimulation occurs and opioid facilitated reward begins as even more dopamine is released  finally it culminates in orgasm the final reward is there endogenous opioid peptides suddenly flood the brain the love hormone oxytocin for bonding is released which also signals the conversion of t to dht 5ht increases and the antidopamine hormone prolactin rises sharply gonadotropin inhibitory hormone is released and that is just scratching the surface   prolactin has antagonistic effects on dopamine transmission which leaves you feeling lazy and spent and while the refractory period lasts a mere 5 or 10 minutes the elevated prolactin continues to exert adverse effects elsewhere in the brain
  thanks for that site anon had a nice time looking around  i wonder what happened to it though it was still going fairly recently i wonder if the admin died and no one picked up the slack
  thom yorke and nick land have begun to merge in the disaster that i call my mind
i just found out im a jew and im having a crisis of identity
  i just found out im a black man  and i always thought i were white
  im not the same guy but tell me something friend  what the fuck do you do with all this mental clarity and energy you claim to have  every single time someone posts about touching their penises youre here to post the same stuff i can even recognize the writing style  jesus fucking christ
  hey man same
  you admit the cost  there is no cost its exercise the human body is designed to engage in activity instead of doing nothing there are scientifically proven benefits to sexual activity and what you are saying only applies to people that are way dependent on sexual stimulation but that could be anything else on the same reasoning eating is unhealthy as well because you might get addicted to its reward mechanism and develop a disorder  i swear you celibatefags are retarded its all because of your stupid christianity
  i think hes replaced the dopamine hit he got from nutting with the dopamine hit he gets upon seeing oh hey thanks man maybe ill give up pulling pud for a few weeks see how it goes in response to his posts
  write study better myself ive been browsing this site again lately only because of a cold     there is no cost its exercise the human body is designed to engage in activity instead of doing nothing   i just explained the profound physiological toll this act inflicts did you even read the previous post   there are scientifically proven benefits to sexual activity  these are from lifestyle questionnaires ie surveys that prove nothing usually an inability to obtain sex shows that there are certain constraints work lack of partners health issues medications likewise bring with them unhappiness whereas people able to indulge it more freely are happier especially in a culture where it is celebrated heavily   there arent experimental studies that im aware of isolating individuals instead we can extrapolate from studying the physiology of the act the potential toll that it can inflect the opinion of medicine for hundreds of years before the 1940s was of the opinion that sexual excess was responsible for numerous ailments suggesting that sexual activity might be costly to engage in is not an absurd premise and one that has existed for thousands of years  i swear you celibatefags are retarded its all because of your stupid christianity  its amazing that the only possible conclusion to all of this is that there has to be some sort of religious beliefs driving it my opposition to indulgence in sexual activity stems from my own experience with adverse effects i always noticed how i would be slower read less and worst of all suffer from extremely low motivation as the years progressed i noticed my sexual frequency increased which shows how strongly subject to habituation this was and how the urge to do it wasnt something of my will but habit and reinforced drive that followed   i never believed in god i have one shot at this this life the way i see it and im not wasting my experience reinforcing some primal drive to hijack what little agency im able to exert over it
  good night everyone
  good night
  
life keeps reminding me that my standards arent too high that there actually does exist the kind of girl that im capable of loving  but theyre all from across half the globe fuck

  nofap is ok for ending porn addiction and improving your test levels but its not like a magical remedy or anything
  think about the ripple affect of your actions paying some confused girl whos lived a life that has conveyed to her that the only thing she is worth is her vagina she splits her money with some man who is terrorizing her emotionally and physically for a portion of the cash like her father did and you innocent pathetic john doe supporting this vile circus of cheap thrill and black magic if i ever met you i would fucking choke you and rape you you weak willed frail boned coward i hate you i want to fucking kill you think about your actions and exercise some discipline you fucking faggot just because your mommy and daddy didnt teach you emotional regulations doesnt mean you get what you want when you want whenever you want man the fuck up and stop contributing to the filth and horror of this world what youve done is evil and i hope you kill yourself pussy

  i feel insulted that you thought i was that low level    yes of course nothing i do can soil my soul for i shoulder no sin the universe made me what i am

  paying some confused girl whos lived a life that has conveyed to her that the only thing she is worth is her vagina  a lot less confused than you
mowed grass is a sick perversion for the rape of land and enslavement of the life living on it   alvin and the chipmunks were mangled by a country club death squad in the parable of the weeds 2 the squeakuel sons of satan want life to grow into one global weed salting the earth so the goods seeds cannot grow mr richards is out mowing the lawn again do you hear it it is the weeping and the moaning and the gnashing of teeth
  i just dont like you and your kind because youre uppity faggots with no regrets for what youe done you can go back to bagging on me for not submitting to you and standing up for my own values like youre some fucking pristine upstanding citizen for saving me from the problem you caused you shot me in leg and now youre bandaging me up while telling me im a fucking moron for not eating my greens and brushing my teeth twice a day and do so even more aggresively when i ask you why the fuck you shot me fuck you and your kind you know where i live come up and get me you fucking coward
  why the fuck you shot me  i didnt know better
i think its about time for another book burning the amount of mass produced plebeian literature that clogs the shelves of any average bookstore is just shameful 99 of it could burn and no real value would lost
  mowed grass is a sick perversion for the rape of land and enslavement of the life living on it    i mow my grass because my dogs and i play in the yard i dislike the deed and the waste but it does help us at least i also have a garden and an area set up outside our fence for animals and nature
  how is it shameful what does it matter that worthless shit exists
  i dont think youll get people to rise up against mediocrity anon people will revolt against anything except the inoffensive
the day of the fateful day came and along an unpleasant feeling too  we got late to the movies we were hungry as well after a long 4 hour jlpt examination test to top it all the guy at the ticket counter was having a hard time reading the qr on my cellphone   we were discussing how we did and the mistakes we made it went horrible for her but i couldnt tell her that    finally got into the theater and the movie was 20min in but the teasers had taken too long lucky for us  our seats were at the center slightly above the mid upper level just the place i like to seat but the seats next to those two were already packed with slightly overweight otakus color me surprise in the middle of our stair climb i told her if she would like to seat next to the corridor since there were at least 5 more available not as high or centered as i would prefer but being next to no one also had its merits  the theater was pleasantly silent for an anime showing just a few laughs at nothing in particular here and there not the cringe fest my friend told me two days prior  we were paying attention at the movie all right but we were talking here and there and making fun of it along the way i noticed she had her legs crossed and both arms holding one another all the hour and half of the movie runtime years ago this super aggressive girl i invited to the movies went directly for my hand and intertwine our fingers together while despicable me hadnt even reached the half mark i dont have many dates but this was particularly forward i figure i could use that same trick but never had the chance she never used the arm rest    movie was over and we were starving i offered her a fancy chinese restaurant just meters away not the ones where the chineseborn woman took your order but choose whatever topping she felt like adding this was pricey as she called it she tried to hold back on the food by choosing one of the least expensive fried rice i chose lo mein and shared half of my servings she did the same we didnt finish any of our parts it was too much  we spent hours talking and eating mostly about her about her family she was very open calling out some relatives as she was praising others i was questioning her agreeing with her on some things and making her consider different points of views others were i didnt  i made eye contact a lot and i was conscious about it too for an average 20yo she was tall and meaty although not quiet fat on the belly or face not at all however her legs and breasts were mildly distracting  it was almost 7pm when i offered her an ice cream but she had to finish study for tomorrows exam which was today i asked if she wouldnt mind walk her home it was dark at 7pm after all
  think of the carbon taxes anon
  based
  jlpt  what difficulty
  then came the long talk because the walk was too as well and during that walk were hints here and there i noticed them i heard them i saw them in the flicker of her eyes was there gonna be a next date i never considered there was gonna be one she was a 20yo with a boyfriend i knew this    she told me we arrived at her apartment i segued into a farewell conversation and immediately went for her cheek she couldnt react at all i saw her standing still waiting for something and one second later we were parting ways she kissed my cheek too her lips were dead center on it when i said goodbye i felt the warmth of her goodbye i didnt kiss her cheek like she did though for me was just a cheek sideways kiss like argentineans do when greeting but in our county that was a goodbye gesture  i didnt leave right away because i felt i made a mistake we look into each other eyes for two seconds that were painfully awkward i was starting to believe that maybe she wasnt expecting this kind of farewell that she wanted me to tell her i like her and i wanted to kiss her i couldnt i start talking again encouraging her for her next exam saying i had fun today and asking her to take another japanese course next semester so i dont feel alone in class i wasnt alone though she knew that and wasted no time in saying it out loud she said that most of the guys think good of me  i waited for her to turn around and walk back home she did and i started walking away seconds later the first minute or so i felt like rewinding those last minutes again felt like choosing another option in my life because a feeling of failure was walking home next to me    i then returned home and the feeling passed i was content an hour of two later not feeling like i dodged a bullet but not feeling i wasted an opportunity either  at midnight she typed hey私たちのデートが好きです  i answered with an in love emoticon and typed よかった  then she said sorry to panic at the end wont happen again  today i might see her in class i hope it does not get awkward       n4 lectures and time killed me i might not pass this year
saw a picture of my crush  ill never get over her will i
i think it would be immense fun to be in a biker gang i find myself wondering if i could make it work regardless im definitely going to write a story about bikers at some point    would i be of any use to bikers if they wanted another stooge they would pick someone dumber than me to be a bodyguard or bouncer or bagman im not trustworthy enough to be a gunman hitman or enforcer i dont care for riding motorcycles     one thing i do have is planning and strategy and can help a man see the world in a different light this is a very powerful skill in its way and in the right positions can have outsized impacts on events i would also be perfectly willing to commit the crimes and would get my teammates backs when shit needed to go down    of course i would probably grow to hate the scuzzy underworld and sin of this lifestyle the long nights drinking and partying until someone has to die or the trampy women whose fishy snatches and gin and cigarette breaths can be smelled from across the way its an evil ultimately sinful life but it has its benefits and its pleasures and you feel like a man doing it for once
day 1 one of my nofap and i already feel my desire kicking into overdrive i blocked all porn sites on my computer but ended up driving to a red light district to gawk at the halfnaked whores instead
  the day of the fateful day came
  how many times a day did you mash your cock before
  ah now i remember who you were  well dont worry about the test anything but n1 is a meme anyways    so whats the problem with her do you already like someone else is she not hot enough are you looking for some edgy girl off the internet instead
  it takes away a lot of their power when you can just pay for sex doesnt it
i bought a new computer mouse to replace my broken one
  depends on who you ask
  you failed take this advice and start over again this was due to your own licentious mental wandering which caused you to drive there which may have been initially provoked by something as simple as an attractive woman on a news website if you continue from this point aroused youll just be fighting against yourself which is pointless dont go there again or if it was a thumbnail here block all thumbnails
  just one not even every day i just have an extremely sexualized mind and im constantly looking at porn thinking about fucking or thinking ways to be able to fuck more i dont even particularly like the act of fucking or jerking off its almost entirely mental
  yes but it also makes them a lot more unpleasant to deal with since they compensate for this loss of power in other ways
  here comes celibatefag with his sermons holy fucking shit
  yeah looks like you have a dependency more than not fapping you should stop looking at porn thats what actually causes dependence
there never wa a need
  if one tells oneself the ends justify the means but the ends dont ever come to fruition what kind of despair does that leave one with    what level of bad prose can be covered by plot      this
  pretty obvious sign you should try again
  he wants to over come this youre free to ignore it he clearly needs help and wants advice like he mentions here 
the bombs are going to drop soon i can feel it in the air and the mystique of the culturethe hamfisted corporate culture which has everyone idealizing and fetishising the commodity as some abstract ideal but it isnt abstract real blood went into making that dopamine rush and everyone else in the world hates you for it yes they hate younot just the politicians and the corporate overlords they hate america for the people who live here and for good reason america has become a joke filled with the grave the slothful the obedient    yes the bombs are coming the great replacement is a joke of course another viral meme but the effects of culturemixing a country are very real they undermine the stability and structure of a nation and soon this country will fall
  like he mentions here   not there here 
  this will just reignite the neuronal pathways that were instilled by pornography in the first place
  condescending piles of shit will never me leave me alone whether or not i submit you really think you can hurt me at this point go for it honestly give it your best shot fuck you and your uppity kind and your neverending powertrip
  its shameful because while some people like to think we live in an age of enlightenment the existence of this trash proves that most people are still ignorant superstitious creatures like they always have been it matters because those bookshelves could be filled with books that actually inspire one towards greatness but the workings of capitalism have decided that it is more profitable to cater towards the lower rather than the higher i can find plenty of plenty of copies of wash your penis in any average bookstore but im yet to find a copy of fanged noumena for instance
  try not think of me when you masturbate
  well dont worry about the test anything but n1 is a meme anyways  i have never seen anyone passed n3 and not become a some sort of weaboo my friend and 2 teachers i know around my age have become the in japan this in japan that type of person also same friend translates japanese conversation out loud during movies where they forgot to add subtitles i didnt know it annoy me this much  anyways i know ill never get n2 and be myself as i am right now at the same time but studying for a year and not pass the exam as easy as n4 was disappoints me      nothing she is perfect by writing im trying to repress this unnerving feeling that invades my head sometimes that maybe and just maybe she is slightly interested in me and i deserve a girlfriend like her  i use this type of thread to straight myself out and kill them  also she is 10 years younger so yeah probably just daddy issues
  you shouldve answered with でした
  huh
    try again and then what ill just keep on failing during the first week at this point
had the chance to ask her out and i was a coward i didnt take the chance what the fuck is wrong with me now i have to suffer the pain of regret and heart ache until i see her again maybe this is the only way to coerce myself into doing what i have to do that and the fear of dying alone
  try meditation when you feel horny
  it does get much easier after the first 2 or so weeks  just try over and over until you make it i used to be super addicted but eventually managed to go several months clean and then maintain a once every 1 / 2 weeks routine  its also important that you go completely cold turkey
    also try channeling your sexual energy into sports
  reminder that the likes of freud practiced semen retention because they believed it would help them productively
    i agree for the most part but not entirely on the cold turkey if you do happen to do it again while cold turkeying it youll beat yourself up all the more an important mindset to have when tackling any addiction this included is to think nah not this time when youre about to
  the likes of freud  is that supposed to be en endorsement or a condemnation of the practice
  also she is 10 years younger  there it is      お前もいたのか  俺もうねるよ  おやすみ
  i keep seeing posts like this  that america is doomed and its only a matter of time im the first to agree this countrys fucked and things are only going to get worse but i dont know where it goes from here and these kind of apocalyptic predictions sound very disconnected from reality to me desu    take your scenario whos dropping these bombs where are they being dropped what are the warring factions/sides in this scenario how would any kind of civil war logistically work unless the corporate and political elite are completely on board i have seen no convincing answers to these kinds of questions
  true indeed friend quoted correctly this time  sigmund freud psychologist founder of psychoanalysis freud held the opinion based on personal experience and observation that sexual activity was incompatible with the accomplishing of any great work since he felt that the great work of creating and establishing psychotherapy was his destiny he told his wife that they could no longer engage in sexual relations indeed from about the age of forty until his death freud was absolutely celibate in order to sublimate the libido for creative purposes  according to his biographer ernest jones
  that seems pretty autistic desu
  realistically in the event of civil war the us is just going to fracture into smaller countries more or less along the regional territories like the midwest and the deep south cali better be scorched earth though
  not if youve ever experienced the productive flow states that abstinence confers
34 days of nofap about to be broken right here and right now
  the problem with that is that the division is less between states than urban vs rural regions like in the event of a secession how would texas deal with houston austin san antonio etc all being liberal strongholds besides the corporate and monied elite would only be hurt by a balkanization and i dont see how any effective legislation could do the job and also gain enough support given how divided washington is i can see there being more political violence but for all their political extremism zoomers are just as soft as most americans and would not give up their comforts for possible jail or death so even thats overstated to me also texas v white in 1869 establishes a state cannot secede
  dont do it
  resorts to name calling because hes too afraid to live by higher principles and respect himself and others pussy      people live lives that imprint upon them their perception of not only themselves but others when you grow up being sexually physically or emotionally abused these self and world view patterns become very difficult to break especially growing up in certain environments pre disposed to poverty drug addiction and sexual crimes of course you may say the same about the counter part john doe he too has grown up with negative perceptions of self that are difficult to break however 9/10 times he has the correct environment to be educated or educate himself and make a positive change source have worked in addiction and sober housing and seen a lot of this sort of thing
  why do you want to control a womans choice so much
    niggers chimp out and destroy things all the time in america no one cares i envy the police officers who get to tear gas them and beat them     the act of protesting itself is a meme evil needs to be rooted out at its source if different militia were mobilized to combat local police forces and the national guard then maybe that would be a revolution the precedent established by incidents like waco ruby ridge and even the american civil war make it seem very difficult truly the american federal government is monstrous i guess completely defunding it would be a good place to start previously the french might have stormed an armory and beheaded the king today all they can do is chimp       what is the reign of terror    btw the american revolution wasnt really a revolution american government was already headed towards the course of representative democracy they just removed the retarding effect of having the center of decisionmaking reside in an overseas government even if there was no revolution america would probably have just had a parliament no big deal seen from this lense there really has never been a revolution in america such as the likes in russia and france
  because in america the police are trigger happy motherfuckers and will put you in the ground for anything perceived as an aggression or wrongful offense vid related just got into an accident and was escaping his vehicle he was completely innocent
  turns out creating an army of bloodthirsty paul blarts isnt that great of an idea
almost makes me want to go to the last remaining porno shop in nyc and buy a hustler
    there are more nonpolice than police they are horribly outgunned in america too bad all americans are divided by arbitrary and intentional reasons or are just plain cuckolds of the state yikes
im sick of wasting what little precious time i have on earth working to line the coffers of some rich fuck
  dude there was one of those in my city the cops were chasing a dude in a stolen car or something he got into a crash and the guy he crashed intos car exploded and the dude crawled out on fire and the cops ran up and started kicking him as he burnt its on youtube somewhereim not a rabid cop hater but bro
  niggers chimp out and destroy things all the time in america no one cares i envy the police officers who get to tear gas them and beat them    imagine being this much of a twat and thinking like this i find it so hard to empathise or take seriously any brainlet that says this kind of tripe
  there are more nonpolice than police  holy shit
      
    its never about justice its about the state making you recognise its authority

    the police in the scenario of race riots are only doing their jobs and containing a social problem i would prefer to not be ruled from the slums    but please tell me why race riots are such beautiful things so we may understand and empathize with you
  race riots    umm excuse me those are rebellions or so my stalinists comrades say
  tips on marketing furry erotica sounds like relatively easy money also im working on a novel too ironically i know how to write character and what to make them do but i cant write a proper setting for shit guess i just need to go out and explore more
  you make a lot of assumptions
  it wasnt a big conspiracy directed from the goldman sachs tower to defend capital the cops were high as hell on adrenaline from racing all over town at high speeds and decided to fuck up the first dude they saw

  grow up
    cucked by capitalism
since the end of 2015 until august of this year i lived in complete ennui i had completely given up on myself and the world it was a terrible period and the lowest worst state ive ever been in nowadays im attending college have a few friends and have been working out sleeping and eating well for someone who spent days feeling too weak to get out of bed this might seem impressive     now heres the thing i feel like shit feel like theres no progress feel alone and isolated all the time feel inadequate due to a fuckton of things feel like im unworthy of love feel like im the lowest working out gives me a bit of happiness as does reading and drawing but thats far from enough just fleeting moments of calm between terrible storms this december ill start boxing and taking drawing and piano classes and if things go alright ill ask a girl from my class out this week even tough i feel insecure due to barely having any relationships and being a virgin and think shell probably say no ill help my mother with a charity event a few weeks from now and go after a job even though the chances of me getting one at this moment being slim ill put bracers to fix my crooked teeth and buy some new clothes ill go driving with my uncle and lose my fear of it    the point being no matter how many things i do or plan on doing i still feel like trash for fucks sake for the first time in my life i have a profile pic on something am the healthiest ive ever been and doing studies that i might even conclude but i still see myself as some subhuman when does it go away anons im tired and every day the tiredness pools day after day since i was a kid why why why
  why are liberals so completely incapable of imagining building a better society
i am so scared of getting old seeing people lose their sanity and vitality as they age is one of the saddest things in the world to me even in their late 50s my parents admitted to me that they feel as if their best days are behind them i already feel it myself each year i get further away from the simpleness and innocence of childhood a beautiful state that i will never feel again   although i waste my youth by staying inside and never participating in life so perhaps there will not be such a decline as i age

  it sounds like you still dont have much of a purpose or goal with all that you still need a reason other than i dont want to be miserable anymore   a man with a why can suffer any how  or however it goes
    im just getting into it and havent done commissions or anything write what makes you horny thats all i do marketing i dont know
  tried it twice and both were incompetent      a man with a why can suffer any how  nice phrase i realized the purposelessness of my living a good time ago but the thing is its not like i can go to the store and buy a purpose the best i can do is keep myself going and trying despite whatever happens even if it is futile in the end    anyway thanks for the suggestions anons
  its not like i can go to the store and buy a purpose  yeah thats the trouble but you are going about it the right way it sounds like all i can say is keep suffering the how despite whatever misgivings you have listening to them is what made you miserable in the first place after all just trust that there is a why even if you dont know what it is youll be better for it

  im not sure what to make of /lit/    whenever i browse this board despite whatever i may be in the moment  i am overwhelmed by the potency and madness of it all there are too many ideas everything is deconstructed and put back together over and over i cannot encapuslate the meaning into myself it is too much    i read a post and think hmm what an interesting perspective then someone shits on it and i think hmm also interesting its not that my mind has changed nothing is convincing only expanding but the stretching what is it doing to me     what have i learned from reading so many posts i see that no idea or system is strong enough to stand alone thinking forms layers crystals inside crystals fractals of energy like crabs in a bucket competing perspectives endlessly crawl on top of course to even see it this way is nothing more than to be another crab    is it better to hide in my castle all alone it seems so clean wellkept familiar
the short story im working on is really good
  talking to my first and only love about her first and only love and some other stuff too including how his friend raped her and she came out of it traumatized but still fantasizing about her first love and i completely get the feeling
  if you said you want me to write a 350 word sentence well i got news for you buckaroo end of sentence what do you think about that and what do you think about not putting question marks where you think they should go well tell me 224 really what a crock of shit eat shit what am i supposed to do mixing up placement of periods and question marks get on my level talk like a valley bitch match your edge to mine im right on the edge looking down the valley its so far away look a little lower there just a few steps in front of you see that edge see that cliff look at all that air between that edge and the bottom of the valley valley valley too soft of a word canyon is what it is wily e coyote territory go ahead get a running start and leave this earth just dont look down remember lessons looney tunes taught you reality kicks in when you see not when you feel or smell or taste touch or think just when you see and when you see something that makes sense logically well youre screwed if screwed is what reality dictates you should be
  
everyone lives vicariously through narratives they create for themselves even this observation is me casting myself into the story of a philosopher the points were people are most alive are precisely those where the boundary between character and observer grow indistinct

  sorry dude i cant think of anything too close to what u post but this is nice    
  it is tho once you have language everything becomes text
  i dont think he meant it in that western ego centric way look into some eastern tradition regarding ego and authors like robert anton wilson and the new falcon press crew the master game is a great book that goes into these realms of thought as well these sources will provide some clarity on what i believe anon was trying to reference
  your head is just a shell or container of consciousness as soon as you close your eyes you realize this consciousness is behind your face you are behind your face your face and body isnt apart of you its covering you and you simply control it all you are is consciousness

  post motivated me to get back on my no fap working out and doing yoga gives me a lot of sexual energy and its hard to not take it out but its worth it
  but its worth it  why
mythologize  since a guy i know died i began to try to write something about him the problem is that i notice i often exaggerate things i used terms such as unique like no other or that kind of talent is forever lost to us now in fact i never read anything he wrote and didnt know the guy well and havent seen or talked to him years before he died yet i wrote like i knew exactly what contribution he was about to make to the world  he was a popular guy and quite a few people wrote eulogies for him i guess i was trying to compete with the eulogy but even when i knew this mentality of competition is distorting my writing i noticed that i began to summarize things other people wrote in such a way that those things sound like my personal understanding of the deceased i was fucking plagiarizing on an eulogy    finally the mentality was broken when i actually heard from a person who actually knew him well as he was complaining about the shortcomings of the deceased i began to realize that the deceased was just an ordinary person i didnt know my mind was at peace and i stopped wanting to write something about him
  not him but helps with motivation to read and focus main reason why i do it also think about sex much much less after a while and random arousal stops makes it easier to plan my life and go after my real interests
i want to go the library and chat up some girls about random literary trivia and then try to have sex with them because im a nerdy virgin im scared though for some reason i wish i was like diogenes of sinopehe didnt care about the opinions of others and felt no shame masturbating and defecating in the athenian agora if my life was a novel itd make an interesting chapter

  endogenous opioid peptides suddenly flood the brain the love hormone oxytocin for bonding is released which also signals the conversion of t to dht 5ht increases and the antidopamine hormone prolactin rises sharply gonadotropin inhibitory hormone is released and that is just scratching the surface     and the whole room clapped
  the commission contends that the proliferation of filthy books and plays has no lasting harmful effect on a mans character if that were true it must also be true that great books great paintings and great plays have no ennobling effect on a mans conduct centuries of civilization and 10 minutes of common sense tell us otherwise     neither does the second sentence follow the first nor does the third one follow either of them
  i think about what it means to be a person in their teens and early twenties coming into the world as an adult and trying to make sense of it all   i think about how much the world has changed even since i left mandatory education at 16 and how in 8 years the world is so much different to how i imagined it would be and not for the better   i think about the different spheres  the economy environment society and it appears that across every sphere things appears to be crumbling social media austerity and the need for constant profit and growth seem to be tearing countries apart and pitting people against one another the unthinkable has become to the norm to a point where rather than being outraged we just laugh in despair  i wonder if the world has always been as openly shitty and chaotic as it appears to be or due to increased interconnectivity and constant stimuli we have merely become aware of it through peering at our screens   i wonder if ill look back at this period in time and think whether my pessimistic thoughts towards the future is was me just being a raging faggot or if ill look back and wonder why i didnt do more to prepare for a life with genuine struggle when the internet gets cut the power goes and the supermarkets run empty
  you are a faggot but youre not wrong a steady and inevitable decline is currently underway look forward to a significant drop in your quality of life in the coming decades unfortunately i doubt well experience an actual collapse in our lifetime just increasing drudgery and discomfort
  life will continue to get worse but remain above the level required to cause revolution there are no roads in the uks future that dont lead to a radical authoritarian government somewhere down the line maybe therell be war but i think thats a long long way away
  im sorry you had to be born from a crackwhore mother but women are free to use their bodies as they see fit
  i am if anything aware of my faggotry   i think this constant drudgery is already underway here in the uk weve had a decade of austerity and its continuing in london theyre screaming for more police yet theyve already announced theres going to be more cuts and less officers this is the trend across the uk on the whole and across all public sectors as a graduate alot of my peers are struggling for work and those in public services face long hours with fuck all pay  my gf is on 16k for a role that requires a degree in a dysfunctional council as theyre struggling to hold everything together due to cuts     combine that with a mix of an underemployed underclass struggling working classes zerohour contracts and middle classes squeezed and under pressure even more with living costs/luxuries people here are fucked off already i believe brexit was a direct consequence of that  ignoring all the outcomes the predictions and models and any route stemming from brexit currently is that we either we take the decision back which will alienate 52 of the country that voted for it or we have a nodeal thatll have the same effect as an immediate depression       i assume youre in the uk from your post but do you not get the feeling that the clock is ticking before something big happens here as in a mattter of when not if im not sure about the authoritarian side but i do think brexit regardless of outcome is going to lead to a shitstorm in the next months theres no good outcome from it all
hey /lit/  i just had this great idea so hear me out  you can fap  however you can only do it if you talked to a girl on that day facetoface mind you  sounds like a good incentive to stop being a sperg imo
  like hell  im on my second day of nofap and this girl that was sitting behind me started playing with my hair all of a sudden
  i met with her at the college cafeteria an hour before class she was with her usual friend the one who replaced the company of her boyfriend when he realized he couldnt keep up with two years of japanese just to be with her  it was awkward like i predicted it was hard for me to hold her gaze this time around i dunno why the conversation continued and eventually her eyes eased out like they became gentle over time and i could endure her stare longer    we got to class and she sat beside me again despite she had walked next to her friend all the way to class i guess its becoming a habit now to sit next to the same person at the end of the semester  the class continued and the partner exercises encouraged me to keep talking to her normally however i noticed she was being more inviting like asking me every time she took notes which color should she write now she kept writing text and happy faces on my notebook when i was talking to the classmate who sat in front of us finally she left a question that evolved into a written conversation between the two  コーヒーが好きですか she wrote on my notebook  あまり飲みませんi responded out loud  she asked me why i said it was too lazy to make me some i do drink it but i regularly dont  the class continued another opportunity and she grabbed the notebook and wrote again  コーヒーのみせいきましょうか  and i responded out loud again umいつ i wasnt doubtful i made an agreeable gesture  あしたはどうしますか  i tried felt like an asshole this time like this guy  and responded on the notebook too  明日はどうですか and added a  mark next to her text she gave me the look and i apologize with a smile  i finally added ええ行きましょう    the class ended and i already knew i wouldnt walk next to some classmates and our teacher to the parking lot they were heading to where i normally head so we normally walk together after class but i wasnt this time around i walk next to the 20yearsomething to the opposite side until we reached the college library where her club was about to gather it was 930pm cold almost raining and the classes were already over for the semester i wanted to ask what will she do at this time but i didnt instead we talk were should we go tomorrow and when she named many coffee places around the campus while holding her arms to her body to mitigate the cold we agree to an hour i needed to come during lunch break i felt bad for letting her stand outside when she didnt have any sweater on so i hurried her to her club gathering and we said goodbye    mere ten seconds later after parting ways i realized i should had gave her my zippered sweatshirt
  integrating you elementary japanese lessons into your work  absolute ballnumbing cringe my dude
is the extra stuff they add actually useful or complete trash
  wrote about heart of darkness for my year 12 lit exam this year the essays in it were useful for framing my own perspective within the history of interpretations of the text and i think i actually quoted one of them on the final exam     no idea if theyre still useful for uni students though
  i found the notes on paradise lost very helpful especially since my knowledge of bong history is pretty limited
  useful if youre actually studying the text and need some critical material to draw on but if youve got access to academic journals then why even bother spending the extra money inessential
  i love them just having context and commentary in the same book really motivates me to dig deeper into a work       then why even bother spending the extra money  the crazy thing is that theyre usually just as cheap as penguin or oxford good quality too
salingers best book discuss
  its actually the worst seymour made mad as hell wish i never read it
  raise high the roof boom carpetners  seymour
  no
    this is his third best book
  i personally like franny and zooey better as a standalone read but this is probably the most innovative seymour is a strong storyaboutstories that foreshadows a lot of the postmodern stuff that emerged in the 60s and 70s and roof beam is the only salinger story besides catcher which changes setting more than once or twice    overall 8/10 will read again

great post op i wish it was 2015 so you could get rhe response you deserve
getting people to adopt the labor theory of value is literally just a practical joke the jews play for shits n giggles its their version of but it was all right everything was all right the struggle was finished he had won the victory over himself he loved big brother    its scientific lmao
  annnnnnd theres a 2018 post contemporary /lit/ there you have it folks
  i wish it was 2015 so you could get rhe response you deserve  what did she mean by this
    op made a pretty good joke about marx actually being buddha but to get the joke you have to know about marx and buddha which is probably less than 2 of the present board population whereas in 2015 if would have been more 510     and of th9se 510 of 2015 posters some of them would have had some damn good jokes in response   was the best i could do pretty bad    i remember once i posted a pic of dr zakir naik along with  you will never see aquinas take shahadah on peace tv    and a ton of people got the joke now people would respond with blah blah muslims open borders muh taqiya    fuck those were good times
  seeeething
  underage b
  im going to tell you something incredible youre not as funny as you think you are
  its not original i seen the same joke before
  based we need to make /lit/ great again
stirner is the only hegelian who had a good idea
  not an argument
  whats your argument against the labour theory of value
  joke  its a vague comparison that isnt interesting or funny
tfw you will never see st thomas aquinas take shahadah live on peace tv
  i remember once i posted a pic of dr zakir naik along with  you will never see aquinas take shahadah on peace tv  can you explain this to me i know who both those people are and that aquinas even wrote against the muslims but i see not real punchline if the punchline is that aquinas would never say the shahada because he wrote contra islam then its a weak punchline and a unfunny joke
  im a medical doctor  i hate it when he says that even worse when he goes on to validate biological and medicinal claims within the quran
  le funny esoteric jokes
  uses a big boy word without knowing it  man this board really is shit
  why arent people communists anymore  you lost go have some gender reassignment surgery that is all thats left of your revolution

  and heres another 2018 post very boomerontwitteresque
  the very same argument i use against mainstream marginalistutilitarian economics wheres the evidence
  cringe
  blah blah muslims open borders muh taqiya
   to show the way to universal human emancipation    he never really cared about that its maybe a dozen or so of vague pages out of all of his works
  this anon right /lit/ needs to become a conservative marxist board more wisdom from aristotle aquinas spinoza hegel marx and macintyre less /pol/ adolescent incels
  labour theory of value is just an analytical and theoretical tool how is it wrong arent handcrafted statues not more valuable than massproduced ones labour does provide value to commodities the more labour power required to make a commodity the more valuable it becomes another example would be supercars like lamborghini mazzerati etc the production of these cars are much less automated and takes a lot more manual labour to say that labour plays no roll in the value of a commodity is just stupid if you for example could just materialize a lamborghini wouldnt it be less valuable   anyway value is pretty abstract and there are multiple ways to aproach and understand value but to dismiss the ltv is just butthurt because you dont like marx
  arent handcrafted statues not more valuable than massproduced ones  would that not be because the handcrafted one is likely to take more time and be rarer than the massproduced one rather than the fact it was handcrafted giving it some inherent value
  take more time  what is the snlt you absolute brainlet  where does this idea come from that marx has some romantic attachment to manufacturing his theory is literally made to explain the tendencies inherent in mass production of goods with machinery and his and smiths etc intuition that prices fluctuate around an equilibrium according to observable laws bears out
  lets have a thought experiment you are at a marktplace and there are two stalls selling the same statue behind the stalls there is visual production and churn out statues at the same speed one is machine and the other is human the price of the statue is the same which one will be bought more    my assumption is that we like craftmanship more than automated production what is important though is that humans have some kind of behind the scenes look of how their commodities are produced which is lacking in the current marketplace also a note is that there was a lot of labour that went into the creation of the machine that automates production    maybe a more scientific/objective theory of value would be the energie theory of value energie is more quantifiable than labour the more energie required to produce something the more valueable it is
    genius metaphysician  acts like a materialist but is secretly an idealist  i agree with the latter statement but the first one is just not true
  isnt there an assumption here that economic exchange is entirely about the consumers satisfaction and has nothing to do with rewarding the producer for his labour i understand that if the producer makes something of no value then theres no point in rewarding him for it but surely the producer  consumer ought to be able to come to a mutual understanding of fair price which meets the demands of both i know that a ruthless consumerfocused market will probably be more productive in the end but only in a way that tends towards making slaves of the labourers themselves and depriving them of their dignity after all why does the selfish consumer care if what hes buying was made by literal slaves if it means paying a lower price
    so value is all subjective i get it
  the more labour power required to make a commodity the more valuable it becomes    just because the production of any commodity requires the purchase of more labour power doesnt mean its more valuable in any sense competition regulates value as a social process and establishes an aggregate value structure it would be more accurate to claim that the more social labour power required to make a category of commodities the more value generated by that sector which leads to counterintuitive notions such as industries that socially require more labour power are the source from which value is being appropriated from and redistributed by financial mechanisms ie agriculture is generating more value than manufacturing but as it becomes more capital intensive the aggregate surplus value will diminish and it will empirically manifest in a declining rate of profit      if something is rare it can command more from societies labour in return the thing is handicrafts arent the general case and are more of a special case of monopoly rent same with all natural resources
  marxs analysis of the commodity form and essential elements of capitalist production is basically an aristotelian project neoclassical economists are brainlets because they pretend that merely quantitative concepts are sufficient to model a complex social phenomenon
  just because the production of any commodity requires the purchase of more labour power doesnt mean its more valuable in any sense    paying a labourer well for his work has an incalculable social value do you want a population of workers who feel adequately rewarded for their work or do you want a bunch of malcontent wage slaves who are always clamouring for reforms by paying workers well you are investing in the wider community/economy
  any system of waged labour where investment by private or public actors determines the quality and quantity of work available guarantees next to no one will ever feel adequately rewarded for their work such a society will always be in conflict regardless if the wage rate can or should be administered by legislative fiat
  forgething stuff like fairtrade
  i mean there are a number of studies that verify the major predictions generated by the ltv if youre interested
  hey im one of the other marxists in this thread and i just wanna tell you that i think you misunderstand the ltv a bit the theory wouldnt apply to lamborghinis or mazzeratis because they are not freely reproducable goods also if by handcrafted statues you mean statues created by artists and not factory workers then thats not a freely reproducable good either
  the emancipation of the workers contains universal human emancipation  1844 manuscripts
  lets have a thought experiment  if statues could be 100 created by machines nobody would be massemploying people to make these same statues and in fact the value of these statues would plummet which is already what happens to many mass consumer and subsistence goods as the organic composition of capital increases over time
      this    ironically considering the thread topic /lit/ being this much better was the same time it was heavily marxist
  i am
  its an axiom  its not subject to empirical enquiry     the ltv is a useful starting proposition which is why locke and smith used it it makes intuitive sense to argue value arrives from man extracting resources from nature  regardless if you agree with marx on where he went with this stv and ltv approach the issue from a different ontological basis
      
  its an axiom  its not subject to empirical enquiry  not sure what you mean by this value is proposed as a theoretical unobservable yes but the predictions generated by the theory are certainly empirically testable
  i dont think ricardo and marx start from labor they arrive at it not sure about smith marx at least puts forth the argument about the equalization that must happen in an exchange in order for the exchange values to be commensurable which is something aristotle also talked about
  n wot if somebody sold one million dollahs for one dollah
no economists use marxist frameworks in modelbuilding outside of a few dedicated marxist departments umass if it was correct it would be used more if its a bourgeois conspiracy explain why there are so many marxists in other social science departments
  if nearly every economist rejects marxs theories then it should be easy to explain why such theories are incorrect  could you do so
  im not a trained economist so ill take their word for it for the time being a communist would just reply that they didnt understand marxism anyway so whats the point if marxist frameworks were useful for economic modelbuilding people would use them successfully they do not any longer
  well i think most marxists would argue that the vast majority of american economics departments dont teach marx beyond a surface level how many economists who reject marxs theories have actually read the entirety of capital do you think but the point is that when people cant explain why a theory is false beyond pointing to authority figures who think the theory is false we typically dismiss those arguments as fallacious
  they read it in the 20th century dude there were mainstream marxists during that period marxism was literally a mainstream position among the educated at the time but so was fascism to be fair     but the point is that when people cant explain why a theory is false beyond pointing to authority figures who think the theory is false we typically dismiss those arguments as fallacious  there are theories in biology physics etc for which its hard to correctly explain why theyre false but theyre still false and most practicioners in the field agree youre just a marxist and are attached to the theory its like a youngearth creationist telling someone they just dont understand creationism
  they read it in the 20th century dude there were mainstream marxists during that period marxism was literally a mainstream position among the educated at the time but so was fascism to be fair  sure there are still mainstream marxists im questioning whether current nonmarxian economists have sufficiently studied his work  there are theories in biology physics etc for which its hard to correctly explain why theyre false but theyre still false and most practicioners in the field agree  are you talking about unfalsifiable theories such theories are rejected because of their unfalsifiability marxs major economic theories are falsifiable  its like a youngearth creationist telling someone they just dont understand creationism  when talking to a creationist you wouldnt say that they are wrong because most people disagree with them though right you would point to the evidence that is at odds with what they believe
  imagine the smell
  from where
  nothing is worse than the traditionalists who advocate hinduism on /lit/ other than any buddhist on /lit/ congratulations you know a few sanskrit terms big fucking whoop nobody gives a flying fuck friendly reminder that /lit/ is a catholic and orthodox board
  you can invent increasingly tortured theories to justify creationism in the same way that you can produce tortured explanations of flatearth theories perhaps not coincidentally flatearthers youngearth creationists and marxists all think the establishment is keeping them down      sure there are still mainstream marxists im questioning whether current nonmarxian economists have sufficiently studied his work  probably not its mostly considered outdated/wrong in light of the failures of attempts at communism bohmbawerk critique questionable status of the ltv outside of /leftypol/ memes like cockshott and cottell why hasnt every economist become a marxist like the other social scientists if this result is true etc    are you talking about unfalsifiable theories such theories are rejected because of their unfalsifiability marxs major economic theories are falsifiable  try telling a marxist that theyll just say you didnt understand it ask a different marxist and theyll say the same thing but with a theory that contradicts the first one needless to say there will be no math involved    when talking to a creationist you wouldnt say that they are wrong because most people disagree with them though right you would point to the evidence that is at odds with what they believe  no i would direct them to a biologist who could explain the errors of youngearth creationism in light of a lack of expertise myself i take the word of experts in a field outside my own for lack of obviously better alternatives unless i have researched it in some degree of detail myself or unless the experts seem obviously wrong or retarded      no not unfalsifiability but that sometimes its complicated to explain why a theory isnt true to someone who doesnt have some background in the field in question
  hey guy im not a marxist but im basically familiar with his work and have a degree in history some kind of definition of the ltv and an explanation of why a good has to be freely reproducable in order for the ltv to apply to it would be incredibly helpful afaik ltv states that value is only produced by work why doesnt it apply to this kind of production
  from marx from his poorly wiped hairy asshole to be precise did they even have toilet paper back then
  you can invent increasingly tortured theories to justify creationism in the same way that you can produce tortured explanations of flatearth theories  okay my point is that regardless of how ridiculous a belief is fallacious arguments shouldnt be taken seriously as criticisms of them  probably not its mostly considered outdated/wrong in light of the failures of attempts at communism bohmbawerk critique questionable status of the ltv outside of /leftypol/ memes like cockshott and cottell why hasnt every economist become a marxist like the other social scientists if this result is true etc  dont know how the failures at attempts at communism falsifies marxs theories of capitalism as for bohmbawerk his primary criticism seems to confuse exploitation as an ethical argument hilferding wrote a comprehensive rebuttal if youre interested  no not unfalsifiability but that sometimes its complicated to explain why a theory isnt true to someone who doesnt have some background in the field in question  i never denied this but if its difficult to explain why a falsifiable theory is false to someone with understanding of said theory maybe its not false
  a lack of expertise myself  maybe this is the problem you have no expertise whatsoever but feel like your opinions and kneejerk reactions would be backed up by experts youre making a category error by throwing marxism in with young earth creationism and flat earth theory marxism is a well established philosophical tradition the others do not have any kind of academic merit if you want to claim that ltv is wrong because its marxist and all marxist theories are wrong because of the failure of 20thcentury communism you wouldnt talk to a biologist youd make an argument based on historical evidence with the plethora of failed communist states that the 20th century gives us as a field from which to choose examples you wouldnt have much trouble putting together a decent argument unfortunately you lack the skills required to do this instead you make appeals to abstract authority in areas where you admit to knowing nothing at all and assume that any authorities who may disagree with you shouldnt be taken seriously because they arent liberal economists
  sure the ltv proposes that the value of freely reproducible commodities is determined by the average amount of unskilled labour required for its production at a given time and place thats the basic idea goods that are not freely reproducible like works of art or trademarked goods dont have equilibrium prices in the sense that marx means because competitors cannot enter the market of production for those particular goods so the theory doesnt apply to such goods
  thanks for not being dismissive i see the distinction now
  no worries youre right that marx thinks that only human labour creates value so the human labour required in the production of nonreproducible goods would therefore create value but this value wouldnt have a bearing on its average price to the same extent that the values of freely reproducible goods have a bearing on their average prices
  most economists would say that marxist economic theories have no academic merit either though     theres no point in trying to argue about the failures of 20th century attempts at communism with a marxist though as marxists will just reply with that wasnt real communism every marxist you ask this to will give you a different explanation as to what is and isnt real communism    as far as i know a formal at least somewhat mathematized theory of marxist economics whose claims can be investigated and firmly shown to be quantitatively true or false does not exist i only know of roemers attempts at doing this but im pretty sure it was accused of not being real marxism my academic training was in math not economics but i can at least open an economics textbook and read it and understand what liberal economics is saying cant say the same   for marxism we just have endless critiques of ideology instead  if such a theory did exist and gave incorrect predictions marxists would just say that the authors of the theory didnt understand marx its closer to a tortured version of scholasticism than a theory of economics
    most economists would say that marxist economic theories have no academic merit either though  do you have evidence of this    theres no point in trying to argue about the failures of 20th century attempts at communism with a marxist though as marxists will just reply with that wasnt real communism  ive heard this a thousand times and dont care you could at least try to make an argument right now when not everyone in this thread is a marxist youre also conflating basic familiarity with a philosophical tradition with complicity in the greatest genocides of the 20th century which is insulting to anyone with an education anyone who has more familiarity with marxism than you do you have none is in your eyes as bad as a stalinist because they try to show you that you are an uneducated fuckwit with no reading comprehension skills whatsoever   my academic training was in math  so why do you seem like such an idiot  if such a theory did exist and gave incorrect predictions marxists would just say that the authors of the theory didnt understand marx  i dont understand why you think this matters conflating politicized interpretations of a text with critical interpretations of the same text is fallacious
  didnt mean to reply to 
  theres no point in trying to argue about the failures of 20th century attempts at communism with a marxist though as marxists will just reply with that wasnt real communism every marxist you ask this to will give you a different explanation as to what is and isnt real communism  again how do the 20th century failed attempts at communism or the viability of communism at all for that matter falsify marxs theories of capitalism  as far as i know a formal at least somewhat mathematized theory of marxist economics whose claims can be investigated and firmly shown to be quantitatively true or false does not exist  what do you mean the labour theory of value itself generates about eleven predictions all of which are empirically testable
  what do you mean the labour theory of value itself generates about eleven predictions all of which are empirically testable  are the results i assume they confirm the ltv or the authors wouldve been denounced as not understanding marx by now published in a semireputable journal i would imagine confirming the ltv to be true after all would be a complete revolution in economics
  i dont think you know the first thing about economics anon
  posted a few of the more entrylevel ones here 
  umassedu  based and zoopilled
  accept marx was maitreya    this is blasphemy and you should be mauled to death by wild tigers
  they pretend that merely quantitative concepts are sufficient to model a complex social phenomenon  but that is what marx was doing in practice no amount of denying his royal road in an introduction can excuse the economic determinism inherent in his mechanistic and totalizing account of the socalled political economy and neither can tacking on adhoc addenda qua hegel in volume 3
  uh hey buddy many you didnt consider this buy his kids starved which was like impossible in the 1800s maybe if he had submitted to the system he critiqued and not written influential literature his kids would have been allowed to die of black lung like normal kids
  do you know what probably happened they got older and grew out of it
  holy fuck cringe im glad were never going back to old /lit/
  muh taqiya  god that takes me back why cant we go back there
  there were mainstream marxists during that period  youd have to stretch the idea of mainstream to claim that though mainstream economics which are the ones predominantly used for modelbuilding and economic engineering of all kinds have been broadly marginalist/marshall equilibrium theories since the late 19th century    what do you mean with modelbuilding anyway is it predictive models about future movements in capitalism ive seen people use marxist frameworks for that outside of umass if its about that socalled economic engineering/governmental advising then id say that marxian economics arent used for that because youre right that they are useless for that they are working from a different set of questions and are oriented towards different goals in the first place related to this a lot of marxists would tell you that predicting future movements within capitalism is not as simple as economically modelling trends since marxism as a framework is broader than economics
  most economists would say that marxist economic theories have no academic merit either  most economists of the mainstream reputable variety that you assert is the one that counts would have asserted contradictory things about contradictory approaches at about any two arbitrary periods of the 20th century economics as an academic institution is wildly volatile with things like neoclassical economics swinging into a keynesian framework with neoricardian returns and back into broadly neoclassical and now you have things like postkeynesian congresses and modern monetary theory and all sorts of heterodox shit that became super prominent after 2008 there is nothing like the research programmes of qft in physics or the modern synthesis of biology the basic presumptions under which the science is conducted are challenged and turned around constantly
  you must be a richard d wolff fan has he written anything lately
  embarrassing post
  richard wolff is more of an activist than an academic tbqh you must be deliberately avoiding any serious marxist academic if you think thats the best representation of it
  relax a bit friend i see you were just in a heated debate have a drink unwind     im not very into marxism nowadays but i remember reading wolff and some book by davis harvey that was pretty good who are the big guns as you see it
  in terms of marxian economists id say people like shaikh moseley kliman carchedi and those called the temporalists more generally foley roemer aglietta and then theres people who are tangent to marxism in a way that makes it hard to claim the tradition has no influence on academy generally like joan robinson sraffa or kalecki theres people with blogs like michael roberts who are current on this literature but dont necessarily produce new literature themselves and in languages other than english as well although im only familiar with astarita and guerrero in spanish
  what the fuck these studies doesnt prove ltv at all just cherrypicking different industries and applying some pseudoscientific models to state something else
so this thread is just another example of marxist retardation 90 post and theyve yet to post proper proof of ltv actually working or provable for fuck sake this thread with all its academics and prostitutes cant even conjure a basic answer towards a simple question
  this michael roberts blog is pretty great thanks god ive been getting so bored with the news lately nice to read something that delves a little deeper
like bro seize the means of production for the little guy hehehebe
what am i in for
  probably one of the better books that youve ever read there is so much room for poignant detail that has that universal quality like damn this author really gets my experience even tho he was a russian aristocrat     this book made me a genuinely more loving  forgiving and less angry person
  also does anyone have any good reccs for essays on wp you guys really helped me out with moby dick

gets great reviews in the new york times etc  top contender for 2018 awards  gets no discussion on /lit/    why is this allowed
whats it about have you read it    i bought milkman the other day since it won the man booker but i havent started it yet
    its bretty good about gay men in chicago during the aids crisis and a women trying to find her estranged daughter in paris in 2015
  fag shit    no thanks
  the new yorker rarely endorsed anything good
    then its a good thing i mentioned the new york times instead them
  shouldnt it be called the gape believers
  hate gays who produce most of the culture  thinks he can be more than a pseudo
  gays who produce most of the culture  imagine partaking in this culture
  the new york times is even worse
  umm excuse me but isnt a woman writing about gay men cultural appropriation stay in your lane ok
  same i dont even know what milkman is about i liked lincoln in the bardo thats the only reason
  yea so its not worth the read tanks
hello friends i recently looked up the background of warhammer 40k and it looks like an insanely cool universe    the vidya and board games dont interest me but the literature does however theres literally a trillion books by all kinds of authors can you recommend me what books to start with
anything by dan abnett  the lore is terrible fyi nothing works unless you patch it with copious amounts of headcanon thats one of the reasons abnett is good he writes a version of 40k that isnt fucking moronic
start new book  have to look up a term in the first sentence in the dictionary
  good my favourite books are the ones that teach me new words
  fuck i know this feel
authors quite often do that so the reader feels inferior and blames himself when he drops the book for being boring shit
ive thrown away the coffee ive avoided junk food all day im lying in bed at 5 pm with no motivation to do anything how do i get the motivation to do anything productive and my free time when im an ugly 28 year old beta male with no friends or social experiences since school no female attention ever and have never been to a pub club or party even through university and living alone in london and working in an office with other young people    no motivation utterly blackpilled feel guilty about everything i do dont do and how i do it have fomo about everything life ends at 30
start doing 100 pushups every single day while eating massive amounts of oatmeal and raw and unsalted nuts take cold showers before your workout stop all electronics at 6pm and take melatonin every night at bed dont go to bed later than 10pm    if you do all this your testosterone will rise your muscles will get ripped you will feel alive full of energy and motivated
  hows the weather in london
  life ends at 30  only for women  for men it begins at 30  everything before that is prep
  holy fucking based
    i hate all life rules i want to be successful through acts of free will not by being a slave to self limiting rules
  why dont you suck on these raw salty nuts my dude
just take the ssris londonfrog youll feel better
  recommending starchy/fibrous foods chock full of antinutrients and pufa  yikes just tell him to bite down on a cyanide capsule and get it over with next time
  start doing 100 pushups every single day while eating massive amounts of oatmeal and raw and unsalted nuts take cold showers before your workout stop all electronics at 6pm and take melatonin every night at bed dont go to bed later than 10pm  suicide it is
  yeah thats cool and all but have you tried going bald at 21 you should shit was so cash  __
is it just me or does londonfrog get more based every fucking day
  dont do it op ssris make me want to kill myself every day ive tried three different meds all of low and high doses each
  hell probably kill himself after a week of this what a depressing routine
  london frog is finally doing it  we have faith in you man  congratulations  seriously good luck if you ever restart the coffee habit make it imperative that its early mornings only my rule is no coffee after 630 am it can get out of hand ive been drinking 8 cups a day recently which has been too much
  first of all fuck you degenerate piece of shit throwing a pity party on 4chan feel free to commit its always a valid option   realistically though putting yourself in a better mood is very easy you just need to trick yourself into starting to do something productive then its easier to let inertia carry you wake up at a reasonable hour have a good breakfast and the rest of your day will be much better
  how are you coping with it anon i mean are you embracing your baldhood by shaving your entire head or leaving it be im not gonna go bald anytime soon i think but i keep thinking what i will do once i start balding

how did argentina a country in nowhere land poor and crimeridden manage to pull out a jorge luis borges
argentina was one of the richest countries in the world at the time of his birth and early life kys
same way russia did
  a country in nowhere land poor and crimeridden  not a single one of these statements is true though
  even shitholes get lucky once in a while
  argies go to fucking mexico to work as waiters lmao
  argentina was the third or fifth potency of the world at the beggining of the 20th century or something like that that lasted a few decades i think    im not so sure of that because im argentinian and im stuyding history at a professors institute but thats what one of my teachers told me    there could be some kind of patriotic sway in his discourse but i honestly dont think he was all that wrong even withuout studying 20th century history in a proper way yet    for many people argentina was a main destination at the early 20th century just as usa was        between 1860 and 1930 exploitation of the rich land of the pampas strongly pushed economic growth4 during the first three decades of the 20th century argentina outgrew canada and australia in population total income and per capita income4 by 1913 argentina was the worlds 10th wealthiest state per capita5
the same way brazil pull out me
borges spent his youth in europe

  unironically this vargas llosa and gabo are overrated imo
  what an illiterate ignorant
  argentine here its a shithole
  please do enlighten us
  suffering creates good writers    thats why theres is not a single good writer from the first world in the last few decades
  this read henry suso
thank you argentine for taking in my nazi ancestors
  they didnt
  they pull a cortazar too hard times give birth to great men as the saying goes also to paraphrase the third man in 500 years of democracy switzerland got chocolate and the cuckoo clock in italy 30 years of borgias got you michelangel leonardo etc etc
  the starving artist is not a thing anymore    if you read bios from every great writer almost all of them had that phase even richfags like hemingway it was like a requisite to become a writer

in the entire history of philosophy
james is more like plato peirce is more like aristotle    james is more selfreflexive and mystical closer to truth in the platonic sense while aristotle is full of brilliant insights himself he is more of an energetic systembuilder who inspires lots and lots of secondrate retards to turn is ideas into dogma     too many fucking degenerate peirceans these days never met a bad jamesian
    so what your telling me that pierce was all about logic facts reason and james was more muh feels
  this is the laziest troll ive ever seen
  um thats not a picture of dr greg johnson sweatie    the final verdict on american pragmatism was delivered by klages many decades ago
  its trollish indeedbut pierce was one of the greatest minds ever not just in americahe introduced many things to mathematical logic that predate frege he is coinventor if semiotics and created pragmatism    he is far above and beyond any other amerian philosopher in terms of accomplishments its not even funny
  sean goonan
someone besides me makes a peirce thread   goood
  hey tuts what kind of characters do degenerate peirceians have   im the only notable peirceposer on this board btw i consider myself a pretty good guy    klages you say what is the verdict post it as a radical biocentristi prefer animist peirceiani believe peirce was somewhere in the same camp)))i was interested in him especially to see what he had to say aboutdevelopment thats an issue that literally hits home  give me a quick rundown
also james is important i dont agree with whitehead equating him to plado but he is easily on par with many of the brilliant contemporary american analytic philsophers
i dont know much about pierce but i have seen many call him americas aristotle and that he was a complete genius    what did he do
  
dude was a complete racist and you guys say he was a good philosopher    peirce grew up in a home where the supremacy of the white anglosaxon male was taken for granted and negro slavery was considered natural60    until the outbreak of the civil war his father described himself as a secessionist but after the outbreak of the war this stopped and he became a union partisan providing donations to the sanitary commission the leading northern war charity no members of the peirce family volunteered or enlisted peirce shared his fathers views and liked to use the following syllogism to illustrate the unreliability of traditional forms of logic61 see peirces lawother proofs of peirces law    all men are equal in their political rights  negroes are men  therefore negroes are equal in political rights to whites
  muh racism
  fuck off
is there any philosopher who can tell me how to stop taking gianty bloody shits my bumhole is on fire
    2/10 made me reply
  what
  cringe
  all men are equal in their political rights  negroes are men  therefore negroes are equal in political rights to whites  whats the problem with this
  he also beat his wifes and black servants allinall a typical 19th century american aristocrat benjamin and charles peirce gave prehaps the only decent argument to be made in support of slavery which is a completely amoral one they said slave labor gave them more time to be comfy and work on acedemic pursuits  he also hated american acedemia and the church because of the restraint it placed on scientific inquiry he was a dandy and was a bitter critic of the capitalist political economy for the same reasons and the fact that it completely destroys apagastic love and community
  its mostly a takedown of james and watson wie finden wir die seele des nebenmenschen    cant find a translation unfortunately
  dont forget about emerson
  the second premise is a bit of stretch
  well peirce didnt like their sort of pragmatism very much or even consider it pragmatism
  never met a bad jamesian  thank you anon  a large part of my appreciation of james is that all of his other devotees that ive read up on are essentially scientifically oriented aesthetes or vice versa aesthetically oriented scientists    the jamesian tradition gives shelter to sentimentalism without abandoning intellectualism
  good point its not fair that i lump them together
  did he really beat his black servants
  why the fuck did all american and european philosophers around that time all have the same fucking beard
  nobody is above fashion even the greatest minds in history still dressed on trend look at kant and his wigs
  just one he suffered from trigeminal neuralgiabefore it was known and the intense shocking pain itits said to be one of the most painful conditions possible caused him left him prone to violent outbursts including the time he beat his servant he definitely wasnt a dick and was actually a really nice guy i doubt he did it out of hate

lightning and the sun
yesterday it was a big day i was pondering the crumbling paint on the wall trying to find a cure to this universe listening to my neighbors fighting for millionth time i dont even know their names the only thing i know is that shes a crazy bitch and hes a fucking asshole and they love to break things and they love to break up never for too long a spider crawled beside me wandering here and there doing its own buisness living the spider dream and it made me realize something i fucking hate everyone and everything each one gets his fair share of my hatred and i always feel like lowest of the low afterwards its just like i have this everlasting thirst of antipathy for this world i stand alone i know its the most pretentious shit someone like me could come up with and i couldnt care less at least im not breaking things and i dont have to hunt for bugs and shoot webs out of my anus its not the happiest life but it beats death on the scale so ill deal with it so far so good i guess    books for this feel
im right there with you op
  it beats death on the scale  does it though
looking forward to your book anon  just keep going like this
  yeah i guess choosing life over death is also some kind of suicide you know how its gonna end up
  the catcher in the rye  notes from the underground
you are a fantastically talented and prolific author whose genius is unrecognized during your life only after your death does your work gain the recognition it deserves but you are listed among the greats and studied for the rest of history    or    you are a lackluster hack who bangs out the next young adult series that takes the world by storm you ride the success into movie and tv deals and live in wealth and name recognition but nobody praises your writing ability and you will always feel inadequate in the shadow of the greats until your dying day nobody will remember your books and they will ultimately be eclipsed by its own tv show/movies
neither thank you
easily the first fame sucks and i can make money in other ways while writing in my spare time why would anyone write for recognition
  why would anyone want to be the second people go their whole lives striving to be the first the only pain comes from not knowing
  i want to be remembered after i die i dont give two shits about selling out
  some people would like to make a living off their writing others write just because they have to write
  why do i give a shit what happens when im dead gimme 2
but still id rather be famous than righteous of holy any day
  personally if i could attain rowling status wealth and recognition id be ok with selling out i can get by knowing i made a good story people like to read/watch
  get back to writing
im the first and lemme tell ya its p cool
  it would have to suck to be this world class author but nobody knows about it like even if you knew how good you are and how important your writing will be that only makes it worse
  while it would be better to be the first i think it would be hard to pass up on the second writing masterpieces for yourself and everyone around you looking on at the poor madman who seemingly writes to himself as a way to cope with his situation your parents having broken contact out of disappointment and yourself going on with a minimum wage job for greatness you yourself will never know versus selling out becoming incredibly wealthy and famous everyone wants to be you and looks up to you as a role model your parents are proud of the great man they raised and throughout your lifetime you are considered great only to fall to obscurity after the point where it doesnt matter to you i dont know what id pick personally is it better to live in happiness mediocre or in despair as a genius melvilles words words that come from the mouth of a man who suffered the first choice ring in my ears as i type this  it is better to fail in originality than to succeed in imitation  in truth i dont know anonymous if it was a conscious choice that id remember then id pick the first but if it was something that happened naturally with no knowledge of my own then id go for the second ignorance is bliss as they say
only teenagers would choose number one
  leftists are the ones watching rick and morty    why am i not even surprised
or    you are a fantastically talented and prolific scientist whose genius is unrivaled during your life you turn yourself into a pickle to get out of family counseling and redditors list you among the greats and emulate you for the rest of history
  ok now this is epic
  you sound like a flatulent pain in the arse
  in which one of the two cases i dont end up killing myself ill take that one
  2 because i dont wanna be depressed all my life
  the first is the morally correct option
  the first  its about the art not the fame
  sudden unearned fame and money makes you happy    im not saying some dumb shit like money is the root of all evil but it isnt going to fill that void anon
  at this point either would be nice most likely is the third option im a talentless hack whose idiotic writing is ignored and i die without having any books published completely unrecognised and immediately forgotten
free will or determinism
  compatibilism
  elaborate
  i have no free will so i cant make the decision to answer
  lol
  underlying universal consciousness teleologically moving into the past to create itself
  no    actually wait      wait  no    actually      n      wait  no    but really now  yeah      actually no
  no free will exists in the sense of a rational agent that is above the predetermined world but rather the world is ontologically incomplete and allows a very narrow scope of opportunity within which certain decisions can stimulate the course of the future which is not wholly defined
  go to bed nick land youve been up shitposting on here for three straight days in a row now
the question makes sense only to the extent that we can come to understand that were affected by all sorts of external causes beyond that its absurd because its impossible to live as though we have no free will
structuration theory
    the self being determined though uncaused and indestructible so undetermined in a sense is its freedom to refract into anything and everything else though casual and assured to the point of utter indifference so determined in a sense

this is 4chan this is 4chan  what the fuck did he mean by this
he felt 4chanate to be in our presence
when did you realise that 4chan is the infinite jest
  this is 4channel this is 4channel  what the fuck did he mean by this
    this is reddit this is memes  fuck what was he on about
im sorry that people do this to your memory david
i will never not laugh at the greatly deserved ridicule of this hack fraud why bother reading someone who couldnt even live with himself    the only sincere moment in the life of david foster wallace was when he kicked away the chair the rest of his life was a lie the new sincerity was a joke whose punchline was the creaking of a leather belt around the rafter    his literary career was a menagerie of self help lies told to keep his depression at bay  the audience pussy and drugs were the ghosts at that feast of hypocrisy    the depression was warranted because behind all the gimmicks and the self awareness and the bandannas was no discernible talent
im seated on a board surrounded by pseuds and faggots this is a blue 4channel forum /lit/  literatureandforwhateverreasonphilosophy intellectuallydecrepit liberalinfested mindnumbed insulated from the creative thinking by its echo chamber and insincere memery i am here
  based    yikes
    i just watched this and i spent the entire video repeating the words this is reddit this is memes this is reddit this is memes under my breath    i fucking hated it i was writhing around on the floor in front of my sofa for the last 3 minutes it was so painful    ayy quirky sweating author lmao  if you liked it youre in the wrong place
i took a creative nonfiction course with dfw at ponoma back in 94 we werent allowed to show anyone our essays outside of the class for some reason he seemed naturally intelligent didnt need to look at any notes or textbooks or prepare for any lectures he just knew his stuff and was super casual    i saw him talking to a girl on campus one day he uncharacteristically wore a fila sweatsuit the kind that looks like its made from the same material as parachutes and trainer sneakers with a matching bandana that was his pussy hunt outfit apparently several times a week same outfit id see him hitting on women in it i once saw him wearing it while carrying an identical outfit from the dry cleaners he had like 4 sets of same fila sweatsuit    i asked him about it in class and he said we arent allowed to discuss anything unrelated to class while inside class the same way we cant show anyone outside of class our essays a student called out but dostoevsky isnt in this class and last week you talked about replicating his black tea obsession to test its affects on your own writing wallace stared blankly at the student with dead eyes for 30 seconds in dead silence then said you just got knocked down a full letter grade any other smart asses didnt think so and pushed up his glasses with his index finger    i remember telling myself this guy will either be super successful or kill himself
  post the one about him criticizing a black students ebonics
  lold
  john green is the successor to dfw narratively thematically and socially dfwfags are really john green fans
        if these are an indicator of the complex shitposting on this board then i need to post here more often
  im glad you enjoyed it reddit
  your reply is reddit it wasnt even cleverly written
  t npc
  well you would know all about that seeing as youre fresh off the boat from reddit
  takes one to know one eh
  im rubber and youre glue whatever you say bounces off me and sticks to you
  well youre their biggest customer
  nice larping  well actually its a pasta but either way fake and gay
  liberalinfested  what have you been smoking this place is 99 altright pseudointellectual filth
  creative thinking  conservatives
  tfw i look just like dfw
  thats pretty disgusting
  okay which reddit sub did you copypaste this from
  not him but that pasta was all over all of the dfw threads last year
    t liberal infestation
  its in my opinion the ultimate sign of newfagness when someone claims that 4chan is a primarily conservative board do they not remember 2005 where /b/ constantly trolled far right sources like stormfront sure there was always a cranky racist vibe overhead but for the most part this was irony a release in the years after the whole chanology shit newfound public awareness mixed with misunderstanding to draw in a lot of paranoid loons especially to boards like /pol/   tldr its definitely more of an ironic libertarian weeb kinda vibe
  id rather have dull conservatives than pseudointellectual hacks
4channel memes this faggot so much that i gave in and got a copy of ij expecting joyce levels of fartsniffing and selfindulging prose what i got was simplistic boring prose rife with endless namedropping and metaphoric imagery on the level of my diary circa when i was 14 desu one of the earliest chapters describes a non recovering addict fidgeting as he waits for what he believes to be the batch for his last drugfueled trip the author makes sure to beat you over the head that this is not gonna be his last trip as it happens dfw continuously describes a cockroach darting in and out of the hole this is where i dropped any notion of taking the book seriously and read the rest of it as a fine shitpost
  all time best seller
  the third ones a tv pasta
  i rub my buttered belly on the screen as i think we all do sometimes
  its a contrarian vibe
what define some writings as pretentious and how to avoid writing or creating pretentious shit 
pretentious post op
saged
  save mother europe and her blessed children
  if you have any self awareness at all your work will become less pretentious with practice
  dont read anything from modern times and then you will basically avoid pretentious writings   pretentious writings dont exist prior to the year 1900 only the readers of those writings are pretentious imagining that reading great works somehow makes them smarter and more sophisticated than they really are
  but what would make it pretentious in the first place how would it appear
  dishonesty    honesty    you now have the formula to create great literature and can focus on improving the aesthetic value of your work
if you are from a good back ground try not to overtly express yourself in working class manners which can be said in a similar fashion for those who wish to sound intellectual    keep your ideas clear and write how you would yourself not the version someone else expects of you
if you care about being or not being called pretentious  you are
  i disagree with this wanting to not be pretentious is just a consequence of not being totally innocent
      i have some ideas for stories and eventually i would like to give them a shot i dont know how to start but at least i want to make something im happy with i dont want to make something pretentious
  think about what pretentious means its peetending that something has more meaning than it actually does just write with sincerity and it shouldnt come across as pretentious if you actually feel what youre trying to get across and are not just doing it for show or to make yourself or your work seem impressive
pretentiousness is a simple thing its giving the impression you know more than you do
  i have a thing with girls who look like this long wavy brown hair full dark eyebrows prominent chin 6 ft at least and wearing a sweater
  that girl looks rather young dont you think
  in the face sure but im just talking the aesthetic
all art of worth has to run the risk of being pretentious
one copy of beyond good and evil please
  dude got swagger they way hes leaning in on the cashier
some things are better explained through mathematics
say something nice about the most based poet of all time
  blake was one of a kind done
  kek came here to post this
  im going to kill you
  i remember reading that he could speak 11 languages
  sounds like a classic humanities retard i bet he didnt know any math
  why would a poet need math
  is that true please say it isnt so
  why wouldnt he are you serious math is the pure poetry of ideas
  what a stemfag lol
  im not i have an english degree its just that im not a fool and i know math is a beautiful and essential art
  its not an art though its a science are you american that would explain a lot
  stronger hair stronger you   for hair that shines with all its strength  now you can say goodbye to frizz  say goodbye to tangles  no more tears  live head first  live flake free   wear your hair with pride  stay faithful   because you never get a second chance to make a first impression
  the greatest mathematic minds of all time have recognized it as an art you should read war and peace and stop being a chump
  the greatest mathematic minds of all time have recognized it as an art  citations needed
  its a google away little bitch 
  classic humanities retard  i have an english degree  why so self loathing chum
  math itself is not an art form althought there can be math in art but not vice versa
  not everything that has aesthetic properties is an art form
  keats you need a haircut
  to count the sylla  bles in the haiku that he  never even wrote
/brainlet/ here  is man a material representation of god jesus is god and represents a physical manifestation of god but shouldnt man also represent this to some extent since man was made in gods image is man just a lesser material copy of god and living in accordance with god means reuniting with a greater whole in heaven
none of this shit exists  the bible is just ancient naruto
try reading a history of god by karen armstrong theres an interesting chapter on the trinity and the first council of nicea which should be of interest for you    its pretty accessible
  everything is a material representation of god
  based
spinoza rolls his eyes
i always understood it as man being the only creature with the capacity for creative thinking which is a reflection of gods creativity in making the world
  post modernism
  so you got your animals and plants and minerals right    so then through some naturalistic miracle or what have you you get man who is some kind of naked biped with extremely dexterous manipulator forceps    what are some of the first fucking things that come out of its mouth well if you can take the time to learn its languages it talks alot about god or gods or spirits and demons    is man the material representation of god thats overgeneral man can be even lower than animals but the exceptional men rise to to the level of superhuman even metahuman as if something beyond them animated them like a character in a videogame
  the answer is no we are unique and seperate from god we are created in his image that is to mean our spirit shares the same properties and freedom his does     god became man in the flesh jesus to show us that even he is limited while in the flesh
  female author  dropped
    how i understand it    when the first human was made he was made in gods image the bible specifically says that god is spirit so i am led to believe its not our physical likeness thats gods image but our spiritual one i could be wrong in this observation this does not mean we are gods in a sense that god is it means that we were made as a sort of representation of a trait of god    then came the fall of sin with the knowledge of good and evil its not something we were made for and so doing we became a corruption and we no longer were what we were initially made to be    why didint god just wipe out everything and start over if we were so corrupted    i cant speak for god doing so will be blasphemy how i understand it through the bible however is that god loved humanity even though we become a corrupted shadow of ourselves     when satan said that we will die if we eat the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil we will die the snake knew we would take those the meaning as a physical death so he lied and said we will not die     the death however is a spiritual one the self died and in its place sprited this sort of conciseness we werent never made to have giving birth to the evil nature of man    romans 512 wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned    but if god knows everything why didint he stop that from happening    no person can ever know the thoughts of god the bible does say however that     all inhabitants of the earth will worship the beastall whose names have not been written in the book of life belonging to the lamb that was slain from the creation of the world revelation 138    so god foresaw it and it was part of gods will    everything exists to the glory of god    how does evil glorify god    the whole of romans 7 explains it better that my own wall of text could    jesus christ was a sinless man the one true son of god that came to earth as a man his nature was not of man but of god but he was born as man     those that followed the jewish faith had to sacrifice animals to cover there sins jesus christ is referred to as the lamb jesus was a sinless man and his crucifixion was gods sacrifice to wash away humanities sin     that is why he is our lord and savior    but humans still sin    its human nature to sin that is why we are guilty of it jesus was the ultimate sacrifice
  then came the fall of sin    i meant the fall of man
man is an emanation of the monad who exists in the material world due to yaldabaoth who  hinders the reunion of man with the monad  prove me wrong  protip you cant
well that sucked
  what didnt you like about it

can anybody give me one reason why life now is better than a huntergatherer lifestyle
  dont know about better but certainly longer and more comfortable
almost no violence or risk of starving or dying of exposure  sleep in a nice bed  access to an enormous variety of food medication narcotics and culture    less community  complicated and unnatural problems    fair trade
anime
  we need to go back
  longer  youre more likely to get old yes but how many of those years are spent doing things that fulfill us instead of spending 1012 hours a day hunting and gathering we spend that time doing things which are empty repetitive distracting and unnatural  more comfortable  this is certainly true though like you said it doesnt make our lives better      almost no violence or risk of starving or dying of exposure  everyone dies anyway an 80 year old man can look back on his life and it will feel just as short as a 25 year old looking back on his the risk of dying young is not so terrible when all of that time is yours  sleep in a nice bed  access to an enormous variety of food medication narcotics and culture  these are both based on our being born into these things our idea of comfort is a lot more comfortable than even someone from a hundred years ago let alone ten thousand or more years ago comfy beds and exotic food dont mean happiness and if you concede that an important part of life is denying yourself comfort than this is a negative anyway     as for a variety of culture what can any of that add to the human experience the stories that satisfy us and make us think are the same as they were back then the philosophies we have come up with about violence god evil and virtue could all be thought up by any man in human history out for a stroll in the afternoon     even the truth and beauty contained within art can be seen in nature just as easily
  living to see your grandchildren is an experience that cannot be abstracted away by your temporal relativism
4channel
  you dont think people ever met their grandchildren people wouldve matured more quickly in that type of environment meaning you would probably be a grandfather before you were 40 the idea that no one ever made it to this age or that everyone died violently are also not true    also things like that should not dictate the structure of your entire life should a young man avoid any and all risk simply because he has never had children
  checked      go be a huntergatherer take a pelt a canteen you even get to keep a steel knife find out and tell us yourself which is better
  go be a huntergatherer take a pelt a canteen you even get to keep a steel knife find out and tell us yourself which is better  wouldnt work in the same way over thousands of years of agricultural society our physiology has changed to make the same lifestyle virtually impossible a modern human cannot simply be dropped into the wilderness which themselves have changed and expected to thrive in the way that prehistoric humans did
unlimited pussy nigga
  our physiology has changed to make the same lifestyle virtually impossible  impossible  citation needed
          during the paleolithic revolution humans were strong people their bones had much large muscle attachments than is common today even for professional athletes their bones were harder too   the paleolithic revolution by paula johnson
  yeah so no wonder life is worse now
  posts pic of some degenerate isolated island race
  well you can always make it shorter and harder what is stopping you
  what is stopping you  laws and regulations social pressure duties as a member of society
  he thinks huntergatherers are a species  you realize hunting and foraging was how europeans survived on the american frontier right and foraging tribes existed only a few centuries before that in some of the harshest parts of the american southwest and mexico until the conquest
also how is this a philosophy thread or related to literature
  being weak  you are right you cant do it
    first of all these dont answer the question    also it would be futile to try and replicate a world that no longer exists you could go off and live in the woods and shoot rabbits with a bow and eat berries but the state of humanity would have changed and you would be an anomaly among people its completely different from being born into that world and it being all you know
  im talking about prehistoric societies whose diet was extremely different from our own and who never experienced agriculture
  go ahead and lead by example
  first of all these dont answer the question also it would be futile to try and replicate a world that no longer exists  that was my point your question cant be answered i want you to try though
  that was my point your question cant be answered  so would you agree that our modern lives are either no better or even worse than those of prehistoric man  to me one you reach this conclusion it explains a lot of old philosophical ideas particularly religious ones in the old testament it says that man was thrown out of eden for trying to be as gods which is essentially the goal of any technological or civilizational progress  to separate ourselves from nature to make ourselves superior to our forebears when adam and eve at the fruit of knowledge it simply meant that they had become selfaware and could reflect on their lives
    in the long history of humans there was a steep drop in lifespans from the paleolithic to the neolithic because humans diet was focused on a few starches they died much earlier it has been only recently that lifespans are significantly increasing and then only in parts of the world the global average is still less than it was in paleolithic times paleolithic diets are more healthy because they are more varied
the key to happiness is having no alternative we will not be happy until all contemporary forms of living are narrowed down to one through catastrophic civilizational collapse    or as heidegger would say when the gods return
  i didnt say that i wanted to do it though
  so youre weak and stupid   got it
  in first world countries its better overall  pros  no starvation  security  health care available  break a leg in the stone age and you are a cripple for the rest of your life  work for middle class people can be relatively comfortable    cons  alienated mass societies no organic communities  more stress from noise and overcrowding  existential uncertainity especially if you cant believe in a religion    for the third world life is probably worse they have all the cons and barely any of the pros i would 100 rather be a cavemen than an assembly line worker in modern bangladesh
  gf with teeth
more poetry     tbh there is no way too refute this without saying art isnt better than not art and if thats something you believe leave
  less starvation hunter/gathering might be ok in the right season in the right part of the planet but for most it would be very haphazard you also have the problem of predators weather accidents illness and old age all of which can effect your ability to collect enough food there where reasons for the low human numbers until just a few milenia ago
    i dont think its much better but i dont think its much worse either  the human paradigm has always been characterized by a unique form of mediocrity that remains inescapable  one could describe it as pros and cons  and attempt to make some rough value judgments which can only be based in subjectivity and ignorance but this is little more than a desperate attempt to rationalize harder truths
nothing to do then except eat fuck find food sleep and kill your rival tribesmen savagely that isnt the most vivid lifestyle as you can imagine
    i just went to the supermarket and bought a whole chicken carrots and onions for 10 feels good
now im shitposting because literacy gonna be thinking later because western canon    suck it cave men
  kill your rival tribesmen savagely  sounds farily vivid
  dont forget wonton rape have you heard about the mass graves of children that archaeologists have found the prehistoric ancients were capable of crimes the modern mind can scarcely imagine world wars included
  less community  how is this a bad thing
can anyone recommend based and redpilled secondary literature on plato
can anybody give me one reason why life now is better than the lifestyle of the early church
  that pic  based book of acts
if i had to give only one reason id say stability lifethreatening violence accidents exposure disease and famines do happen but in a first world country they are not regular hardships and weve put a lot of energy into minimizing them     maybe to the point that were soft for it but thats a trade im happy to make          human beings are social animals social isolation degrades mental health and strips away networks of mutual support its something of a new development that we can more or less ignore our neighbors and local communities but we sure arent any happier for it
  you ever have fudge
  instead of spending 1012 hours a day hunting and gathering we spend that time doing things which are empty repetitive distracting and unnatural  im sympathetic to your view but cmon this isnt true in the way you think it is that time spent hunting and gathering wasnt fulfilling the entire concept of fulfillment came later in our social evolution same thing with being content primitives werent content they were precontent human ability for fulfillment or existential poverty as an opposite came after huntergatherers
  shut the fuck up tripfag
  i can eat more vegetables vegetables are so yummy
  art music  poetry   the buddha dharma
first we should probably decide what better means in this context
in theory i think film is a superior artistic medium than literature how can literature compete with the beauty that is able to be shown in film not to say that movies are better than books but i fail to see how there cannot be films that have the quality of a shakespeare and the beauty of a storaro or lubezki am i wrong how is literature superior to film
its just as valid of an art form but its a completely different experience its using your imagination compared to being shown whats happening
  its better to do one thing well than 10 things poorly by being forced to focus entirely on story literature can offer a purer experience than the confluence of visuals audio story acting and dialog writing that make up film film should be the superior medium but i would contend there are more quality books than movies
well for one thing literature doesnt breed terminal retards that create threads as idiotic as this one
film is superior theres a reason movies quickly replaced novels as the dominant form of storytelling     however now that video games beginning to surpass film movies will also soon be replaced in the future film will be reduced to a niche hobby much like books are today
  theyre completely different forms you cant do in film what you can do in literature and vice versa cinema is a medium of answers for better or worse literature requieres imagination for better or worse neither is superior to the other    and lubezki thinks of himself as an artisan not as an artist now that you mention him
  vidya is not superior to film
    back to you respective subreddits gentlesirs
  movies still make way more money than videogames do
  thinking vidya is superior to film is pretty plebbit though   theyre interactive xd
i think film could be as good as literature if people were more patient if films could be much longer and more experimental right now even the best films only have the impact of a great short story or a great poem
  they have the impact of a good stephen king short story
superior entertainment medium  yes  superior artistic medium  no    art requires strong vision films are simply too expensive to make writing a book is something that one man alone can realistically accomplish making a blockbuster big budget film means investors committees writing teams compromises
  except it is vidya is literally the next logical step in the evolution of art     games are the culmination of every art form that came before writing music drawing/paining animation voice acting etc but with extra layer of interactivity and immersion that can only be achieved in games    no other medium has the same level of artistic potential that games have theres nothing left to do with books but weve just barely scratched the surface of what vidya can do
  thats actually false
  theyre also far more expensive and thus require even more compromise    videogames will never be art until games of the highest quality can be made by a single person with very limited resources
  lol thats being a little simplistic i think there are some films that do cross into art but they are rare i really meant the best films      video games are bound by all kinds of budgetary and creative possibilities of course these are expanding all the time but every time i read someone say this i have a feeling theyve never made a game before i will say though that the mixture of interactivity and taking that away from the player can have an amazing effect like in the mgs series
art discussion  some developmentally impaired neckbearded fat faggot licks his cheetodustcovered sausage fingers and types out muh bidyagayemes are le bestest art
    literature can do more and with more detail movies can only give you a few hours of thought books can articulate and give hundreds
  by being forced to focus entirely on story literature can  i seriously hope you dont read for the plot  also books have dialogue too you know and some authors are highly praised for their dialogue like gaddis and pynchon
ambiguity is the heart of literature while films can retain ambiguity with regards to their themes their characters motivations and even to some degree their plots they cannot retain the semantic ambiguity which defines good poetry or the good novel when we read a line from a good poem we must construct its meaning for ourselves from only the words and we must confront each possibility and select from among them or perhaps retain the tension when watching a film by contrast the filmmaker has already narrowed the range of ambiguity considerably    to use a fairly trivial example characters in novels are described in more or less detail we are able to picture the character ourselves within the limitations of that description that is if we know that mrs so and so is a hot piece of ass mommyfu we are free nay we must transform that description into something else in our minds this does not necessarily mean picturing some specific hot maternal bitch rather it means taking agency to hold the contradictions of the medium within our own minds in a film however the filmmaker revolves the ambiguity for the viewers selecting one and only one sexy milf which the audience has no choice but to accept
  this films are definitely more like a short story whereas something like the wire is closer to a book my favourite film ever eoe relies on you having seen a tv show and thus doesnt have to waste time establishing shit and can just throw everything at you some other favourites of mine 12 angry men and perfect blue feel like short stories in the best way possible
  this and i dont know if its just me but i make characters look different in my head all the time even if i know thats not what was intended for example my idea of dorian gray has black hair even though in the book it says he has golden blonde hair my picture of dorian gray looks more like kafka  sorry for the awful pun
    what about tv
  whats wrong with reading for the plot asking for my friend
brags about fipm as an artistic medium  posts 2001  yikes
  books are usually only books that have words that tell a story and dont utilize the medium of being a book fully the same is true for movies what makes books inferior is that people dont want to put in the effort to be creative enough in their imaginations to picture the events happening in the book so movies do it for them
  shakespeare   quality   yikes use better examples
the stage and frame semiotically constrain the artistic interpertation of film the role the director actors and film crew play in interperting the screenplay basically replace alot of the role the reader plays this makes film a medium where the artist has much more control of the viewers feelings due to the minute control of signs and intentionality this is opposed to literature where the mind of the reader is free to roam and imagine and is much more involved in what is salient literature offers more modality and film as more control of intention of course good directors and authors can control both of these to the limits that their medium can express overall literature offers more room for imagination and discovery for the reader and flim offers more artistic control of the viewers meaningmaking so the difference is one of semiotic modalities you cant really claim one to be better than the other because what makes each of these mediums good in as they are different is nontransitive to the other
  you can do even more if you dont ground yourself in what could be filmed in reality cartoons and computer generated graphics are the next step
  your average art film has more semiotic modality than your average genre paperback i dont think its a meaningful distinction
  in the future film will be reduced to a niche hobby much like books are today    it already is
  my point is the boundaries each medium have
  my point is its not a good boundary to makr the distinction on perhaps the most semiotically free works are novels there is nothing to suggest a film in the future may surpass it watch two men and a wardrobe and tell me it wasnt dripping in semiotic modality
  reading for dialogue  i hope you dont do this either nabokov never read any book with a lot of dialogue
  video games will only be considered art when everyone has the ability to make one films and video games arent considered to be as arty as writing or drawing because they are dominated by professionals who are in it to make money anyone can write or draw so those industries usually have passionate people making what they want professionals/business exec in it for the money have a much smaller chance of breaking into am oversaturated market not everyone can make a film or videogame however so those industries are filled with business execs hiring specialists to produce what they think the public wants
time is dictated to you in filmwith the novel it is not     what youve basically said is that being breastfed your entire life is superior to being given the ingredients from which you can produce a nice stew
  video games will only be considered art  when they are no longer glorified pacifiers for manbabies
omg anon youre a writer that is sooo cool lets go to barnes and noble right now ill buy your book

  begone thot i have transcended the claptrap capitalist machinations of exploitation that support the blatant and welldocumented process of autodestructive advertising and low denominator shillwork of such circles as barnes and nobles the chains and editing houses and publication factories are the death knell of the creative jouissance which characterizes the written word thats why i only selfpublish on amazon

this book his hot ass and so is the series convince me otherwise
does he really a hot ass
  severian is in good shape he probably has a nice ass  wolfe definitely doesnt
  it what his hot ass
  op here the best thing about this fucking book is the cover
  hot ass is an ass that just took a shit im saying the book is bad its poorly written and theres no way to keep track of whats happening
  ohhh im drunkthat is my excuse
  no ones going to bother you either get it or you dont that includes me
  probably his best work aside from some of his earlier short stories certainly seems like the height from which he has since been gently descending
  it is easy enough to keep track of what is happening if you pay attention and stay sober whilst reading it his salute to jack vance and done in his style and consequently his best work
  my favorite part is with the alzabo and the cabin and the part of the humans that lobotomize themselves to escape the burden of thought that follows but thats the second volume isnt it oh well all the bizarre sections are top notch to be honest and there is a good number of them     gunna read pic related next week i hope its good
its just constantly moving he never described the areas theyre in all of a sudden some other shit happens he explains whats happening as if he heard it from a blind man he swung his sword the darkness swept the light away and all of a sudden my grandmother had indigestiion someone stick a finger in her ass what was that thing i hit with a sword who cares lets move on now were in a city guys thats how that books written i asked the writer why he wrote it like that you know what the writter said he said pulls off mask and is the man himself mr j trumpet i aam the president do not say the nworddd
   you me
  im right though ive won the argument no one else will defend this trash/
  alzabo is one of the best chapters in a book also going to read that once i find a fuckin copy
botns is the highest form of kino and if you cant see this fuck off
  jack vance  do you know any good books by jack vance im almost done with citadel of the autarch and ive really enjoyed it so far
  any series is ass stop reading genre shit
    everything is genre shit until time filters it
  the brothers karamazov had a planned sequel
  lots of excellent works that we read as single books today started out as weekly/monthly serials
  his dying earth stories are great and wolfe once said that the book of gold he has ultan describe in his story of the librianians guild is vances tales of the dying earth vances short stories the last castle and the dragon masters are generally regarded as among his best work and are widely collected so you should have no trouble finding them also i really like his novel the gray prince
  thanks ill check these out what about wolfes other works have you read urth of the sun or the long sun cycle books
  not him but enjoyed long sun pretty sure i missed 80 of what was going on though ill need to reread it at some point
  why
  its very good but very tricky you probably will have to read it twice and look up discussions online
  urth of the new sun is meh long sun is pretty short sun is incredible and also makes long sun retroactively better
  me again read the long sun not bad but while in the new sun he is pretty gnostic in the long sun he started to move in a more mainstream christian direction severian is a christ figure but a pre christian christ such as the alexandrian gnosis of 100 bc might have produced with urth of the new sun this is reinforced and made more plain i enjoyed both works urth of the new sun as a sequel and the long sun books are certainly readable but i like the new sun series best also it can be good to take a break from a writer once in a while to avoid style fatigue and read someone else as a palate cleanser as twere
  have not read short sun will check it out
this is the type of person who decides if youre getting published
yeah theyre looking for shit good enough that people will pay to read it unlike that gay genre shit you selfpublished on amazon
  but gay genre shit is whats published havent you been to a bookstore in the past 20 years
what did bolaño mean by this
you are reading it upside down anon
  its backwards m8 but diagrams and little weird charts are a staple of pomo
and this
  i hate it when this happens is there a way to tell if the image im uploading will show backwards
  yeah not being a disgusting phoneposter is one way
  not him but just cut it out a bit before uploading works fo me
  it says right there that the teacher or whatever was bore and he did all those figures cant you read
  who the hell is von hartmann
  bored
  latin american fag here i had never noticed that small spanish upside down looks like arabics
test    but it must exist at least and intention if not a meaning behind them
  worked    did you even read the savage detectives these figures looks a lot like the 2deep4u poems from tsd
  like this
  or these
balano had to write a big book and make a ton of installments to have sold after his death to support his children    so basically the book is all nonsense
  its not any more nonsensical as his other books
does /lit/ seriously not have any insights on this  lame
  when has /lit/ had any insight into anything
  hes deconstructing le big names of philosophy and philosophical discourse by just throwing them randomly into diagrams which are supposed to make sense
    there is nothing outside the box for example    derrida btfo
did salinger predicted the rise of alt right incels
  holden is not an alt right not an incel hes like what 16 or so he literally rejects sex from a woman
  and he rapes his sister phoebe
  god i hate this meme
    wasnt she a prostitute
  me too anon me too
  yes but it also predicted rise of leftypol incels right wing incels marxist incels national socialist incels jewish incels german incels /lit/ incels and so on
  it sounds like you dont really get the book
  no but im sure he would look at you with disdain for analyzing his special autismal book
  yes    its a factthat in societies like ours sex truly represents a second system of differentiation completely independent of money and as a system of differentiation it functions just as mercilessly the effects of these two systems are furthermore strictly equivalent just like unrestrained economic liberalism and for similar reasons sexual liberalism produces phenomena of absolute pauperization  some men make love every day others five or six times in their life or never some make love with dozens of women others with none its whats known as the law of the marketeconomic liberalism is an extension of the domain of the struggle its extension to all ages and all classes of society sexual liberalism is likewise an extension of the domain of the struggle its extension to all ages and all classes of society     its been hopeless for a long time from the very beginning you will never represent holden a young girls erotic dream you have to resign yourself to the inevitable such things are not for you its already too late in any case the sexual failure youve known since your adolescence holden the frustration that has followed you since the age of thirteen will leave their indelible mark even supposing that you might have women in the future  which in all frankness i doubt  this will not be enough nothing will ever be enough you will always be an orphan to those adolescent loves you never knew in you the wound is already deep it will get deeper and deeper an atrocious unremitting bitterness will end up gripping your heart for you there will be neither redemption nor deliverance thats how it is
  this
  its been hopeless for a long time from the very beginning you will never represent holden a young girls erotic dream you have to resign yourself to the inevitable such things are not for you its already too late in any case the sexual failure youve known since your adolescence holden the frustration that has followed you since the age of thirteen will leave their indelible mark even supposing that you might have women in the future  which in all frankness i doubt  this will not be enough nothing will ever be enough you will always be an orphan to those adolescent loves you never knew in you the wound is already deep it will get deeper and deeper an atrocious unremitting bitterness will end up gripping your heart for you there will be neither redemption nor deliverance thats how it is    fuck just woke up and i get btfo by salinger
  my favorite part is when holden gets killed in a car accident after watching a girl sucking a big black dick really says a lot about our society
    thats from wellbeck terrible b8
bump
  alt right is so 2017 the gestalt right a single unified consciousness of groyper twitter accounts is where its at
i might end up sounding like a pseud but i just cant understand it  if theyre looking for disposable entertainment why dont they just watch netflix  i cant comprehend why there are people who already willing to go through the effort and commitment of reading a book choose to read garbage
  plebs will read pleb shit netflix sucks and reading doesnt take much effort or commitment youre literally doing it right now
  maybe they like it
this has to be one of the most insipid retarded headfirmlyinass posts i have seen on this board
  people generally do what marketing tells them if a book is popular they will read it they wont really like it since they are incapable of this level of independent thought but they will be able to relate more closely with the rest of the fans and thats what really matters most of the time people who buy these products wont even consume them there are relatively few people among those who bought the twilight books that actually read them most of the time books are for shelf display or instagram photos theyre no longer meant to be read
  theyre no longer meant to be read  that makes me sad
  welcome to 2018 where everything is an accessory
  yep honestly this is true for a lot of /lit/ as well
theyre npcs
            reddit
how do people know that awful books are awful without reading them  muh reviews
i read rpo because i wanted to see if it was as bad as other people said it was it was worse than that
tfw the npc meme is making me an individualist when i want to be a collectivist
reading is for the mind every other for of media is for the senses its the difference between qualia and consciousness
because theyve never heard of faulkner
  mewled
  qualia arent real experiences you think of as subjective are just operating at layers you dont consciously access
  i see these a lot but is this really how that book is written what the fuck
  see the file name its a fake quote there are other good real quotes though  my insides practically contort with potent needy liquid desire
  they dont see it as a book or literature they see it as a vehicle for entertainment a feelings dispenser that will make them laugh and cry they do not seek something that will make them put effort in they seek something that will give them happy sad nostalgic feelings it just happens to be in book form in this instance
  what a time to be alive
  reading difficult books for pleasure is a very niche market but most people want to settle for wanting to simply enjoy an enticing and easy to understand book they dont watch netflix because even that may be too normie and braindead for them and/or theyre reluctant to use modern technology thats primarily the reason why mostly old people and middleaged moms read simple books for pleasure its not something to ridicule people for just enjoy the fact that youre able to appreciate difficult books with complex meaning
  and yet for centuries people have been reading for entertainment
just finished this masterpiece and i havent felt so deeply affected by a work of literature in a very long time if ever  where do i go from here where can i go from here
  moby dick  war and peace  anna karenina  the brothers karamazov   don quixote
  this used to be my favorite book until i read dostoevsky so maybe try that
you mean where may you go
what are some books about the notion of a technological singularity and how soon its coming if at all
c  r  i  n  g  e
  niggamancer by tweak da tekknologicool brothaman
  theres a bit of that in go to taipei tao lin
  im completely serious i want to know what the arguments are for its possibility
  fanged noumena
op here is this cringe shit im aware that its the type of thing to be discussed by epic pop science clowns neil degrasse tyson michio kaku elon musk etc but i still think that the philosophical implications of ai are something that deserves our attention   maybe i should rephrase my question are there any contemporary authors who are educated in the western philosophical canon and who arent watereddown pop science bullshit
  i think if there were anyone doing work of serious weight on it we wouldve heard about them would you agree this is what has to be addressed before the stagnation of our politics/philosophy/culture can be fixed    all i can think to recommend is learning about the technology itself how it is developed and the powers that wield it my fear is that the companies at the forefront of this field have conscience or transparancy
  authors who discuss ai i mean
  those companies have no conscience or transparency
    thanks for your reply  you make some good points there might not be a much significant literature on the subject yet   perhaps it would be better for me to focus my curiosity on the developing technology like you said
i know we are in lit but there are some manga about that try blame biomega and ghost in the shell manga movies and tv series are other timelines each one with its own merits  in a way asimov is about singularity but not as we see it today ala skynet and shit
  
  how about the bible because the singularity is just the second coming gussied up with circuit boards for the sexually isolated
  c  r  i  n  g  e
  actually a good rec the relationship between a technological singularity and christian eschatology is worth exploring
  would you mind detailing exactly what is cringe about my question/curiosity if im in the wrong for wondering about this kind of thing please explain why instead of doing what you are currently doing which isnt constructive informative or useful in the least
  charles stross is all over that shit his short story collection toast has a cool story called antibodies where we see an ai just as it starts to take over the world    arguing against pretty much anything on rodney brooks blog hes a professional engineer and roboticist too
  how about bad singularity stories    shittier i have no mouth and i must praise harlan ellison    godtier destinationvoid by frank herbert
life 30 is good
  there are differences christian rapture depends on the existence of angry sky guy which is entirely a matter of conjecture we may never understand consciousness to the point where we can simulate it electronically much less overclock it to the point of being superhuman but at least we have the hardware we can point at and say its evolving we are forceevolving it faster than anything has ever evolved before
  hes calling you cringe becuase you asked a question regarding something that hes not intrested in then when you said that you were serious he called you cringe again for caring enough to reply to him theres a good chance that hell call you cringe for expanding on your reply and elaborating and trying to reach out to him when he just doesnt care    in short hes retarded ignore him
the third singularity you mean
suicide note by mitchell heisman trust me
  my diary desu
  when were the other two
  discovery of sticks for hitting people on the head    and    creation of the semiconductor
  wasnt me the second time bub  i cringed and cringed hard because all books written about the technological singularity are going to be biased and think its inevitable they dont explain why or how its just singularity dude futurism wow its gonna be great kids its just to keep stupid plebs excited for a big fat juicy zero calorie nothinburger
  i wanted it to be real like anime but it was fake like the holocaust
  they dont explain why or how its just singularity dude futurism wow its gonna be great kids   have you actually read one or are you just making a strawman about an idea you dislike probably because youre religious
one of stephen hawking wrote something before he died about eugenics and how people who refuse to submit to the superhuman eugenics project will be phased out
  people who refuse to submit  submit what sperm
  to kara boga
  dont believe in god either
  the divine comedy im pretty sure dante envisioned a point in history when all of human efforts would converge into an technodictatorship as he waxed poetic about demons trumpeting out of their ass
  to clarify only the rich would be able to afford supergenes and the poor being outclassed and rendered obsolete by the superhuman aristocracy will rendered unemployed and starve to death
  orgy of the will
mine so far    homer  gilgamesh  egyptian book of the dead  the old testament  the mahabharata and ramayana abridged  resume with the greeks poets tragedists hellenists  the romans aesop ovid virgil etc  the new testament  st augustine  the koran  the epics beowulf nieblinglied etc  resume with the aristocratic age    chock full with secondary texts criticisms and contextual material norton criticals cambridge companions referential poetry etc all dispersed with 20th and 21st century short fiction so as not to lose my sense and taste for the contemporary being that a short story writer is all i strive to do even if i publish as few as two or three stories in my lifetime    in any case i decided not run right through the greeks all at once what are the strengths and weaknesses of this suggestions
  so glad i was born in europe and read about 90 of these in one year of high school literature classes
why homer before gilgamesh and book of the dead
  depends what part of europe in anglo land only books one usually will read in literature is of mice and men and some other shitty book that i dont remember about barely even learn anything about shakespeare or anyone else
  because i already read the iliad and started the odyssey      its possible in america but only if youve got resolute parents and are wealthy enough to go to private school feelsbadman      why steinbeck in england isnt he depression relevant only in the us
  absolutely no idea why steinbeck is in our curriculum found an article on the internet about it   why does a novella written in 1937 about displaced ranch workers during the great depression hold such enduring popularity in schools  the answer is that steinbecks classic is short comprising only six chapters and that its themes continue to be considered relevant to 21st century society
all my problems in life are due to my low intelligence and to being overemotional so naturally i cant do much to increase the former by any real amount especially at this stage in life so what can i read and learn from in order to gain control of my emotions ill happily feel barely any emotion at all viewing everything objectively what can do this
  read into kierkegaards ideas on subjectivity
story on your pic op
  she shot herself in the face
  did she want to live through that honestly at that point she should just be allowed to die
  read the stoics
  meditations by aurelius is unironically about emotional control and learning how to not care about things that are outside of your control give it a read op
  is this the chick that had her hands and face ripped off by a chimp
  great pic op  bravo
  read the filename and dont hate monkes
  she found texts from her boyfriend to another girl confronted him he broke up with her she went to her brother and used his shotgun to blow her face off  she was 18
  and then i became the moon
  
she went into the bathroom put the barrel of roberts 308caliber hunting rifle below her chin and pulled the trigger when robert kicked in the locked door he found his little sister covered in blood and her face is gone he recalled still shaken by the memory  how did she not kill herself  308caliber hunting rifleis that less powerful than a shotgun
  shooting from point blank at your brain  missing
think about your head and where your brain and brain stem is now think about how much of your head and face you can remove while still keeping your brain and brain stem
  
  its not a matter of grains since a 308 has like three times the amount of grains as a standard shotgun shell its all about the ballistics of the round and how much energy is dispersed into the target itself    like if you took a 50 bmg round and shot it at a person it would probably do less than 50 ae even though the bmg has more powder in it thats because its moving too fast to impart any kinetic energy into a soft target thats what i think happened here maybe with the angle of the shot the round didnt impart as much energy into the target as a slower round would
  self inflicted gunshot to the head is only about 9599 fatal that means for every hundred who pull the trigger one lives and sometimes more
  my guess is that the red line is how she shot herself green line is how she should have shot herself
  yeah that would fucking suck to miss
    its not missing the problem is the way your face is shaped its designed to redistribute force as has your skull away from your brain thats why people fuck their fists up on someones face more often than they fuck someones face up it takes way less force to break your cheekbone compared to a rib or arm but theyre not commonly fractured because usually they distribute forces away from your squidgy eyes tongue and brain matter the same force applied to your kneecap will cripple you while you stand a good chance of not breaking your cheekbone
  video extremely related  
  what point are you even making that her face redistributed the force of the bullet that would have otherwise entered her brain i didnt know faces could stop bullets
  im not going to watch somebody shoot their face off thanks very much
  its just the aftermath plus once you realize that humans are made up of the same shit as cows fish hell even trees you kind of get immune to gore its just biology turned inside out
      youre supposed to put the barrel in your mouth
  what was going on in that video
  its not that it would have entered her brain its that assuming guns will eject a rifled round and it will meet with nothing to change its course is just dumb once it hits something its no longer just subject to the wind but also all the bone and viscera and everything else which cushions vital organs its not a space age laser and even a round that goes through a boar isnt going to line up with where your rifle sight was because going through the boar it meets resistance which changes its direction people can have bullets bounce around inside their skulls and enter their brain and it doesnt kill them so whether the bullet went into her brain or not is irrelevant but diagrams which assume bullets cut through meat and bone like a laser are also irrelevant under the chin would run into less bone and redistributing forces especially with a rifle and it looks like her problem was aiming it how anons diagram shows as the right way the green line in his diagram ignores thats where most of the protective bone structures are at the front
  its not even that high dude or do you have access to statistics about only gunshot to head attempts
  no thatll explode your sinuses and soft palate
  try reading the page retard he was some brazilian crime lord who shot himself with a fal and was too stupid to even do that correctly
  its way lower if you include all gunshot to head attempts 90 is the upper limit if you include other people shooting you in the head  its lower again if you count only self inflicted gunshot wounds because shooting yourself anywhere else is less fatal gun shot to the stomach/ heart area when self inflicted is 50 fatal in comparison
  probably another womeme trying to commit suicide for attention
  not if you use a 12 gauge and blow apart your brain strem/spinal cord
   people can have bullets bounce around inside their skulls and enter their brain and it doesnt kill them  lol 22
  people can have bullets bounce around inside their skulls and enter their brain  its a 308 its not exactly a tiny round lol pic related third from the left
  still doesnt eliminate that 15 chance its a small risk but they arent perfect killing machines a rope is the only method with less margin of error but it still has a 12 chance of survival without intervention some people just cant be strangled
  thats kinda funny dude acts like he just got the wind knocked out of him or something
    the most famous case of traumatic brain injury is still gage getting a railroad spike through the head theres a lot your brain will keep going after
  yes except your brain stem getting disconnected
  theres a whole lot of your head which is not brain stem leaving enough room to pass a 6 x 10/16 spike through with only personality changes
  if you look at the ballistics/penetration of different calibres surely a sizeable bullet or buckshot to the center of your forehead would guarantee death the velocity and the quickly expanding gas makes it a lot different to a metal rod  this guy died to a blank he fired pressing against the side of his head
  am i a bad person for laugghing at the pic on the right
  center of your forehead would guarantee death  in about 99 of cases if youre looking for the gun with the 100 success rate it doesnt exist its like looking for the rope with a 100 success rate   would i bet on you surviving a gun shot to the head and self inflicted no its very long odds but does that mean its guaranteed to happen no it just has long odds against it not happening
you cant control your emotions directly once an emotion fires it has a short lifespan until it naturally disappears  trying to control them is like trying to control a water ripple you only end up creating more ripples  doing this in the long term will end up in an anxiety disorder and similar emotional disorders    what helped me out a lot is reading about cognitivebehavioral therapy and mindfulness  mindfulness helps you in the shortterm by training you to accept your emotions in the moment  cbt/rebt can help you in the longterm by giving you insight into why you feel the way you feel  often people have irrational/dysfunctional inner beliefs that make them more susceptible to negative emotion  like if theyre perfectionistic theyll naturally get anxious before having to perform  if they also start trying to control their anxiety through avoidance or repression it ends up becoming an anxiety disorder
  308 win is almost identical to 762 nato which is a full power military cartridge used in machine guns and sniper rifles its 1/3 the weight of a shotgun slug but goes twice as fast in her case it wouldnt have mattered
  that dude is calm as fuck about that
  not using two flintlocks to blow your brains out against the wainscoting  man girls are such fumblers  five days later in the early morning hours of december 11 1782 beadle finally carried out his atrocity tiptoeing into the secondfloor bedchamber shared by his four children and the housemaid he shook the latter awake then ordered her to rise gently without disturbing the children and meet him downstairs when she appeared several minutes later he handed her a note for the family physician dr farnsworth who lived about a quartermile away his wife beadle explained had been ill all night the housemaid was to proceed to farnsworths home at once give him the note and remain there until he should come with her no sooner had she left on this errand than beadle hurried into his bedroom where he had stashed a newly sharpened axe and carving knife after crushing his sleeping wifes skull with the axe he slit her throat with the knife taking care to drain the blood into a vessel so as not to stain the bedsheets after covering her face with a handkerchief he proceeded to the childrens room where he committed the same butchery upon them he left the little boy lying in bed the slaughtered girls were placed side by side on the floor like three lambs and covered with a blanket leaving a trail of bloody footprints on the stairs beadle then descended to the kitchen placed the axe and knifereeking with the blood of his familyon a table and seated himself in a windsor chair by the fireplace several weeks earlier in preparation for this moment he had brought his two flintlock pistols to the village gunsmith for repair he now took a pistol in each hand and supporting his elbows on the arms of the chair pressed the muzzles against his ears and pulled both triggers simultaneously splattering his brains against the walls and wainscoting
  holy based
  you cant control your emotions directly once an emotion fires it has a short lifespan until it naturally disappears  trying to control them is like trying to control a water ripple you only end up creating more ripples  doing this in the long term will end up in an anxiety disorder and similar emotional disorders  if they also start trying to control their anxiety through avoidance or repression it ends up becoming an anxiety disorder  why cant the state just administer painless quick euthanasia to people like me i try to accept my emotions the moment they happen i say ok in my head but my chest starts sinking and my world starts sinking and i feel so weak awful sad and in fear i know why i feel the way i feel its because i am inferior and insecure  you cant control your emotions directly once an emotion fires it has a short lifespan until it naturally disappears  trying to control them is like trying to control a water ripple you only end up creating more ripples  doing this in the long term will end up in an anxiety disorder and similar emotional disorders  if they also start trying to control their anxiety through avoidance or repression it ends up becoming an anxiety disorder  i cant even get anything more than cbt talking/realizing why i feel this way wont help someone with low intelligence or anything for this its just called being a pathetically weak and emotionally stunted individual
ok i get it so how do i kill myself properly
  did you get a special treat when you were sick as a child
  time
  under chin away from brain blew face off
  why cant the state just administer painless quick euthanasia to people like me  were all going to make it anon  does any country do that dont know
  you mean if i was molested i kinda wish i could blame it on something like that but it seems i had fine parents
  i mean did their reward system teach you to whine if they gave you cakes every time you said i feel weak you might just be trying to get more cakes
  i understand how you feel i used to be the same way ive spent years obsessing over my anxiety issues and other emotional problems trying to control them but only making it worse in the end  its going to take some time since youve probably have years of bad habits to unlearn but its still possible to change    you need to develop psychological flexibility read a guide to rational living by albert ellis its cbt but a lot more philosophical one of its main theories is that having inflexible demands creates emotional disorders  from your post i can easily see that you probably hold such beliefs as i must always be calm i mustnt feel anxious/insecure otherwise im worthless etc  anxiety disorders start out as you being unable to accept discomfort of normal anxiety catastrophizing it and trying to control it until it becomes a monster    i wish i could transfer all the intuitive knowledge ive gained but i cant just reading about rebt or mindfulness wont automatically make you understand it intuitively  after reading ellis work my emotions suddenly werent these random events that ruin my day but logical consequences of my beliefs and perception  the cure is developing the ability to accept the present and yourself every time i feel distressed i remind myself i dont have to be calm i dont have to not make mistakes i dont have to not look like a fool etc  whenever you feel anxious examine what inflexible expectations or demands you have and allow yourself to accept certain outcomes

hi my name is thomas pynchon and i suck at writing
  gyangsta fi life
  hi my name is op and smashwords rejected my pokemon fanfic novel again
how could someone say that about the pynchmeister  its just not true
  get your teeth fixed nigga haha no wonder you dont show your goofy ass face in public imma beat your ass if you ever muster up the courage to show yourself dying of snot porcupine
  based
  really gravitys rainbow regarded by many as pynchons masterpiece is pretty ass its like every aspect of his writing is aimed at making himself seem like an aloof new wave beatnik probably why half the novel is taken up with dismissive slights at nondruggy academics and the other half is taken up withdrawn observations about society all in his signature gaudy prose of course
i just finished lot 49 on a plane back from washington less than an hour ago i enjoyed it of all the books of his i sampled the prose here felt most palatable i dont mind complexity of writing but so much of his sentence structure sounds to me like bits of metal being tossed down a chute 49 had a nice rhythm to it
  you cant read it requires a certain ability to find the meanings in his lsdandspeed derived ramblings which really are grotesquely detailed painterly strokes some of the references might not hit you so i recommend reading with a guid but its mostly about the sum of its parts underneath all the silly pynchon bangs the gong jokestheres something kinda magical revelatory and even prophetic about it
  yeah nah
  its mostly just a mindfuck it takes effort
  which really are grotesquely detailed painterly strokes  at last i truely see the literary power of it
  missed by one
  why even make this thread you cunt are you mad your poor widdle brain couldnt digest gravitys rainbow cretin
  for real this dude lookin at the back of the tapestry and gettin caught up in the snaggles and frayed ends instead of appreciating the descriptive passages the roger/jessica storyline by itself is strong theyre in love fuck the war made me feel small and lonely and it was beautiful
ive talked to various professors who believe pynchon is a bit over rated and will most likely be left out of the canon
  hell get a free pass because hes one of 23 decent pomo writers who would you include in the canon in lieu of pynchon
  right and who are they going to add instead delillo hyuk hyuk
what is the best audiobook to listen to while working out
  nothing you should be focusing on your form
maga mindset by mike cernovich
  the sound of lesser men failing their sets and tapping on their phones the grunts of fertile women and dying bodies on the cardio machines above you the hum of the ac and droning insipid pop thats tortuously forcing its way out of the bargain bin speaker system in the repurposed warehouse considering how easily you can tear something or slip a disc while actually lifting and this is the only real form of working out unless you are trying to beat a 400 or 100 time its not wise to lose focus at all for even a moment im uncomfortable looking at my phone even between sets if im lifting heavy

once a white man in an unbuttoned uniform camping on the path with an armed escort of lank zanzibaris very hospitable and festive  not to say drunk was looking after the upkeep of the road he declared cant say i saw any road or any upkeep unless the body of a middleaged negro with a bullethole in the forehead upon which i absolutely stumbled three miles farther on may be considered as a permanent improvement i had a white companion too not a bad chap but rather too fleshy and with the exasperating habit of fainting on the hot hillsides miles away from the least bit of shade and water annoying you know to hold your own coat like a parasol over a mans head while he is coming to i couldnt help asking him once what he meant by coming there at all to make money of course what do you think he said scornfully then he got fever and had to be carried in a hammock slung under a pole as he weighed sixteen stone i had no end of rows with the carriers they jibbed ran away sneaked off with their loads in the night  quite a mutiny    esl  one of the greatest to ever write english  how
sufficiently educated esl has a greater insight into the language as he studied it structurally and methodically as opposed to the natives who know it through immersion a glorified rote exercise that is
  yeah this is pitifully stilted prose his storytelling approaches the magisterial occasionally and he had a good mind for allegory and extended parables but hes definitely overrated as a stylist and as a writer as such
  esl  you mean as a 3rd language polish 1st french 2nd english 3rd  conrads polish english is absolutely fantastic and required reading dont forget nostromo and lord jim by any means necessary
  i couldnt enjoy heart of darkness felt the prose was a bit stilted will i enjoy nostromo
  this     it helps to study it academically  studying the languages it borrows from also helps a lot  studying linguistics can also help  try to learn as much as possible about grammar and composition
what should i read before nietzsche to not misunderstand him and in what order should i go about reading him
skip through all of his books and note down the people who he mentions read them and afterwards read nietzsche himself
  good advice
  so who are the central of these
plato kant schopenhauer would be the most important id say id read him chronologically
  also heraclitus and parmenides
  and heraclitus
  and what should you read before reading those who inluced nietzche to not misunderstand them too    just read nigga
  kaufmanns nietzsche
  ignore the misreading meme have a solid understanding of history western philo prescocraticskant and schooenhaur and then just read him yourself as someone whos done upper level research on n the fork in the road in the scholarship is reductive and unsatisfying anyways the only way you can misread him is to a read him as a nihilist or b not try to do what he says namely think through the very ends of your values and see whether they truly allow you to vent your strength
  or hegel since its hegel who studies change in societies philosophically not heraclitus
  no no no no no no no no no worst advice one could give short of just read the wikipedia kaufmanns interpretation is not taken seriously in the contemporary scholarship for a very good reason
  will this cover them    or is this just a good   just read  book
  n does not give a fuck about hegel lol
  how much food you think got stuck in this fuckers mustache
just dont read will to power because its fake
beyond good and evil seems like an easy read compared to zarathustra
  honestly the best preperation for n is to understand the modern conditionto understand how his prophecy has become true read the platonic dialogues if you really want to and youre p much ready to go n is very accessible in the sense that you can get a grasp on his basic ideas pretty easily his works are extraordinary deep though and he anticipated almost every important and even the unimportant abortions like hicks and harris continental philosopher of the 20th century     genealogy of morals birth of tragedy and thus spoke zarathustra are the most important works
  i have the complete collection  should i read it all or just some dialogues
dont forget about french moralists  montaigne la rochefoucauld chamfort and so on nietzsche loved them and borrowed his fragmentary/critic style from their work
  kaufmanns translations are good and i wouldnt listen to anything a modern scholar had to say about n reading kaufmanns nietzsche is autistic and goes against what n says about his own works     its not fake at all retard there are passages which were mistranslated or omitted but kaufmann and others have remedied the attempts by fascists to mutilate the work
  bad advice  know la rochefoucauld socrates plato aristotle emerson carlyle schopenhauer   know the enlightenment in general volataire rousseau locke etc  know darwin malthus and herbert spencer in general     but once youve read them you know everything nietzsche has to teach you
  dont do this kaufmann didnt know what he was doing there plenty of competent translations none of his writings is hard to get into english even most of the stylistic are conserved
    this is a good comment anon id argue will to power wouldve been mightier than zarathustra had he actually organized the er text appropriately before he died     id say geneology is a good place to start beyond good and evil and gay science are good follow ups though this is by no means a mandatory ordering then you can go for twilight of the idols zarathustra and fill in the gaps with the rest of the texts birth of tragedy is a whole other ballgame but by the time you understand dionysian pessimism you should be able to fit it in nicely with your overall understanding of his works       agree and disagree if by modern you lump deleuze in there thats where i have to depart and there are other valuable voices for sorting through the concepts kofmann clark ansellpearson and dienstag come to mind but yeah op honestly just avoid any commentaries for along time a lot of them are hit or miss
  what should i read before nietzsche to not end up like him i dont want to get cucked and have a mental breakdown over animal abuse
  is this here where jung comes in
  just read faggot why do you need someone to hold your hand through everything
  what should i read before nietzsche to not end up like him  skip him and read carlyle and weininger
  i meant all modern philosophical discourse if you read philosophy after n heidegger or wittgenstein you didnt deserve to even hear about them to begin with its swill and the most insidious excuse for intellectual discourse
  i cant think of another translator who captures ns eloquence as well as kaufmann does
  greatest philosopher had brain aids
  i cant think of another translator who captures ns eloquence as well as kaufmann does  lmao this board
  wwas he wrwrong
  lmao just read nigga hahhahahaha  like its just a book nigga you dont need prerequisites hahahahahaha  youll just forget most of it after anyway hahahahahaha
  by the time youre done with nietzsche youll understand nietzsche isnt a nihilist he hated nihilism
  if its not too overbearing theres no harm in reading most of them there are other sources detailing the best reading order of plato and googling them shouldnt be too difficultthey all tell you to start with the apology and from there read as many as you can stomach theyre generally pretty nice texts
  skip all of them and read something interesting
  no names  wonderful contribution faggot
  emperical moral absolutism
nietzsche really isnt as hard to understand as people make out as long as you arent philosophically illiterate youll be fine

how do we know that the devil did not write or atleast influence the authors of the bible
how do we know that a giant teapot isnt floating out in space its meaningless information without substantiation
  because the devil doesnt fucking exist what the fuck kind of question is that
the devil definitely influenced the kjv
the bible was written by the reptilians
  i thought that was just the book of job or is that dinosaurs
  then god cannot blame us since we had no way of knowing his true word
  yes he can since we can choose to ignore his direct messages and interventions in our lives
  youre right anon a group of stegosauri wrote the book of job
  based
ive been wondering for a while how christians justify the bible being infallible since it was written by human beings i could see it being close but how could a creature of sin fully understand let alone express in words the will of god any christfriends wanna explain
  because the devil is a fictional character
  and redpilled      because the holy bible is the word of god god is immutable and his message cannot be credibly tampered with the book is a record of jesus ministry and so long as the letters in red are obeyed this includes directions to pray to the father you will reap the fruits of the holy spirit
  nobody said the bible was infallible it does say that if every one of us gets together we can build a stairway to heavem and the bible was written by 40 of the greatest writers of human history
  holy spirit
  imagine you had an experience god spoke to you just an ordinary day in the life of anon and the most holy name chooses you how do you record this event what did he say you do your best and so did they and its effect has been clear until the bishop of rome started fucking things up in the 60s and beyond scripture and prayer is good for man any evil that comes from it is mans fault alone jesus was very very very clear on what was expected of us
  the bible isnt a rulebook that clueless people start following even if it serves as a good guide everyone has god and his spirit within them    just like other spirits or emotions someone who is in touch with gods spirit can recognize it and feel it within themselves and see it in others  or it being suppressed     and just like you can detect my spirit in this post you can see it in writing
  do you think that it could be at all possible that evil could have direction i mean we have already established that good and evil are opposing poles of morality and that any thing good or evil approaches an absolute on either side of the spectrum why is at all infallible that the notion of absolute good and evil are not only concepts that exist and exist beyond the limits of human comprehension in the paramount of either state but that these things are caused/defined by or radiate from some divine entities we couldnt even perceive what im saying is in 40 years humans will have approached a better understanding of perfect virtue as a means of defining the law to what end though if we waited 4000 years even 4 000 000 would we be anywhere near perfect as moral beings i wouldnt think so the real question is if that absolute does exist what defines it what beings embody the ideal forms of moral goodness and malevolence and waits for us at the ends of this scale i dont believe everything the bible says but i do believe most if not all of its writers were headed in the right direction and that something exists to define that direction in the first place
  t anons spirit on the left
  theres no distinction my friend
    not authors but translators mayhaps
  mere jocularity mon fratre
  christfags will not i said not be able to answer this op
no because then youd expect the bible to be filled with horrible shit like sexism homophobia calls to genoci oh wait
  but what is your source because if its the bible how can you truly verify if whatever you read was legit and not under the influence of the devil
  my source is experience the power of jesus philosophy of forgiveness and reconciliation becomes selfevident in practice love is the most powerful magic the deceiver literally cannot comprehend it    john 15  the light shines in the darkness and the darkness did not comprehend it
that is to say the devil has no power to alter the word
  so youre telling me i should fake it till i make it
he wrote the entire bible his name is the demiurge
  if you think of taking a chance on jesus teachings as faking it because you lack faith in him yes absolutely put forgiveness into practice be thankful for each day fake it til you see the evidence for yourself what have you got to lose are you so attached to your sins
  what if i were to practice all of jesus teachings to the point of completely emulating jesus being on the level of all saints except for one thing that is not believing in the existence of god would god if it turned out he truly exists let me into heaven or would he banish me to hell
because the devil is bad and the bible authors are good
the devil isnt a postmodernist he just collects them
  what would have been your motivation for emulating jesus so precisely to discredit him or even just a thought experiment assuming you could somehow find the will to pull it off    i will tell you what would happen you would start innocently enough by your charity and sincere meditation assuming you prayed as jesus commanded and the saints you have said you would have emulated did you would discover in time that you are transformed faith in god would come to you and not the other way around it would be something irrefutable like the sun in the sky or your own breathing
   light shines in the darkness and the darkness did not comprehend it    but if satan wrote this that negates your point
  it seems to me you havent read or understood scripture to a degree where you can see how it is a coherent whole that line cannot be inauthentic because christ is a figure with real effect supernatural grace temporal comfort satisfaction christ makes good    the deceiver by definition cannot do that
  is this a dril tweet
  ebin
  but if satan wrote this that negates your point
  he still doesnt understand that all good comes from god  scripture has a salutary effect  but what if the devil wrote it  again i tell you impossible
  but your idea of the scope of god and the limitations of satan come from the bible if that anon is right and satan was the one who wrote about his own limitations and falsified them you would have no way of knowing this
  but your idea of the scope of god and the limitations of satan come from the bible  not entirely the notion of god as source of all goodness and the highest good as first principle shares with the ot a platonic origin and tbqhwyfamily it doesnt matter if you say satan changed scripture because then everything is in doubt how do you know plato wasnt altered as well or your post or mine or everyones every moment thats madness it would be a world of bottomless suffering this is not the case despite what ligotti reading misanthropes on 4chan say    again i say the goodness of god is selfevident all things we call good share a beginning in god all the suffering of man originates with man and by extension the serpent in the garden
  church says so
  the god of the bible is in fact the demiurge miguel serrano was right all along
    because     1 the entire bible lines up with itself if he influenced 1 or 2 authors they would stick out    now with the last point in mind the bible explicitly tells you to follow god and not the devilthat jesus christ is the only way to god that sin corrupts and that those that comprise believe in god when they know better are no children of god    2 the bible is one of the only places that says the devil is still has to get gods approval and follow rules set in place by god why would the devil paint himself as subservient to anything that would be the first thing he would tackle
    this    true enlightenment can only be given by god through jesus christ only those that god chooses can really see the the truth
  what a retarded answer theres literally differences between the gospels for example matthew say that jesus prayed to be spared the cross three times while luke say he only prayed once fucking larper
why doesnt god just destroy the devil
  implying the devil actually exist
    yes those diffrences exist because it was written from diffrent perspectives    if you and i both had to recall an event many days long we would remember diffrent things our recolations would be 100 the same    the book cold case christianity investigates the differences out of the perspective of a retired cold case investigator    if you didint know cold cases are police cases that werent solved so they went cold cold case investigators reopen them since they mostly lack physical physical evidence the investigators excel in the science of investigating recollections from people that witnessed the event     he applied that same principle to the 5 gospels to see if they were truthful
    our recollections would not seem 100 the same
    i absolutely agree however acknowledging that is exactly what makes the first argument in  absolutely retarded as long as we accept the human nature of the people who wrote the bible which we have to do theres no way we could identify an inconsistency manufactured by the devil
  triceratops wrote ecclesiastics
    because that is is how god wanted it to be    god is all knowing he would know a rebellion would happen    the thing is that evil exists to glorify god because     how does evil glorify god      romans 5 explains it  20 the law was brought in so that the trespass might increase but where sin increased grace increased all the more 21 so that just as sin reigned in death so also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through jesus christ our lord
    that is where you are wrong the book we know as the bible had 40 different authors over 3 different continents written in the span of thousands of years yet they a line the probability of that is impossible     to quote john directly 6 there was a man sent from god whose name was john 7 he came as a witness to testify concerning that light so that through him all might believe 8 he himself was not the light he came only as a witness to the light john 68     people that god has chosen to be enlightened know the difference between gods light and everything else
    you do not get saved by scripture but by god
questions of universal truth can be answered in human language and understood by human brains    the fact that neither of those things are true should tip you off that any holy book is a scam even if deities exist
  you repeating in the face of evidence to the contrary that the bible does align doesnt actually mean that the bible does align neither does quoting some random scripture
    evidence to the contrary    the evidence you gave was a large generalization     to qoute you directly  as long as we accept the human nature of the people who wrote the bible which we have to do theres no way we could identify an inconsistency manufactured by the devil    the idea that the bible is influenced by the devil while simultaneously telling you that    1the devil is subservient to god and has to abide by his decisions    2 to stand against everything the devil stands for    3 even compromising your believes a little makes you unchristian like    just doesnt make sense     there is a spiritual aspect to it as well which prove god is the one true force of good and that he is stronger than evil but you probably never had any experience with such things
  watch some peterson
all of this you learned from biblical texts and all of it could have been written by the devil himself
  then everything is in doubt  yes exactly
  peterson is a retard on almost every level imaginable
  dont compare sade to a literal self help cuack
the bible says a lot of things and not very clearly
  how do you know that
  zozzle
  if you cant recognize that a malevolent deity has dominion over this planet i dont know what could possibly get through to you
  grow up and go outside retard
  the guy is basically an atheist
do you know that he didnt influence you when you wrote this
  christfriends  no leave they dont get that privilege not even in jest fuck you
  oh im aware of that jesus said it himself but im telling you no good can come from the satan he works by man man with his genius for disobedience has continually misunderstood the word even used it as justification for war and hate
  no that was not the evidence the evidence is     now i personally dont believe that the bible is influenced by the devil but theres no way to prove otherwise youre evidence against it are weak as fuck non of your 3 arguments are even related to whether the devil might have influenced the bible
    there is a spiritual aspect to it as well which prove god is the one true force of good and that he is stronger than evil  forgot to address this disregarding the immature attack on my person this is where youre right however that does not guarantee that theres no trials or pitfalls
  jesus said it    he did
  yes    john 143031 esv  i will no longer talk much with you for the ruler of this world is coming he has no claim on me but i do as the father has commanded me so that the world may know that i love the father rise let us go from here    kjv  hereafter i will not talk much with you for the prince of this world cometh and hath nothing in me but that the world may know that i love the father and as the father gave me commandment even so i do arise let us go hence    the prince of this world has no power over christ who is the word have faith in that if nothing else

  sorry it is spelled schocken

    what are you trying to imply other than the fact that your average reader is coddled by neatly tiedup ya novels
  based   it must be an excellent translation then
  did kafka really wished this to be burned
  kafka wished almost everything to be burnt he didnt intend to write for public at most anyway

wait so did abraham actually fail the test how come he spoke up for the people of sg but said nothing when god told him to kill his son god doesnt speak to him in the end he only sends an angel which he only sends to minor characters to repeat the same prophesy and his story ends right there
  no the test was if he had faith and obeyed god and he did and god stopped him before he was about to slay isaac
but said nothing when god told him to kill his son  why do you assume this the text doesnt say he says nothing  he only sends an angel which he only sends to minor characters  now thats what i call bait    read kierkegaard you swine
  well abraham does say nothing at all and just complies where as when god was going to destroy sg he questuions him at least    this is true god itself in the ot only talks to the major characters it is a pretty elitist god
  kierky  why would i listen to a christcuck interpretation of the old testament
  well abraham does say nothing at all and just complies where as when god was going to destroy sg he questuions him at least  you think that just because the record doesnt contain abrahams response he didnt have one now thats what i call a leap of faith    this is true god itself in the ot only talks to the major characters it is a pretty elitist god  because when god talks to someone that makes them a major character not the other way around and your original point was that angels are for side characters which is absolutely bunk    sounds like someones self is in a disrelation with itself the self not being the disrelation but consisting in the fact that the disrelation relates itself to its own self reflecting infinitely in the relation to the power which constituted it
  based    looks like his pleb filter worked
  the record does not contain abrahams response  you are reading the text to literally stick to what is in the text    i am actually readong it as a literary text
  abarham was testing god
  there was no test it was merely to show the idiot israelite that they didnt have to sacrifice humans anymore
  you are reading the text to literally stick to what is in the text  i am actually readong it as a literary text  you have our roles exactly reversed since its you whos oddly committed to the text and nothing but the text reading something as literature does not preclude one from reading into the text you know
  holy fucking based
  commited to the text  thats what is required in a literary analysis    and yes it does you are obviously reading it as a historical text
  really you cant read into literature  being committed to the text is good analysis being blind to whats implicit in the text is stupid
why cant writers write genre fiction that is a blockbuster but also is literary fiction that wins pullitzers    most writers cant answer this and just shudder their shoulders asking who cares    i get the same reaction when i ask why they dont make rap of shakespeare or clasical music symphonies of lady gaga and britney spear songs    just tell me why is not possible to make blockbuster films that are also technically marvels    why you cant write a good novel that will perdure on the cannon but is at the same time one of those airpoors novels people pick up on malls
shudder is an intransitive verb
    who cares
  cannon is the thing you shoot a giant metal ball out of its canon that refers to the literary classics
  who the fuck cares you nerd fag
  its spelled pulitzer not pullitzer

has anyone self published before im gonna publish my first ever book midjanuary ive hired professional editors designers and ive built the online platform as professionally as i can manage my aim is to be indistinguishable from tradpubbed if not better     but im looking for off the wall ideas to help the launch given that i dont have a following from elsewhere i kinda need to find a way to gain an audience
  for local advertisement what i did one time was print out fliers for my book and go stick them inside books at the library if you have a book share program in your city you can do the same thing or print your book outright using createspace and put it into circulation
  createspace got folded into kdp but yes i will have a physical copy as well itll all be offered via amazon and over time ill move to different mediums

this thread is for folks who want to read the bhagavad gita together you can keep in contact on our discord server discordgg/vqztdj8 below are some translations    laurie pattons translation penguin classics      barbara s millers translation      traditional commentaries    shankaras commentary advaita vedanta starts at bhgita 210      ramanujas commentary vishishtadvaita vedanta      abhinavaguptas commentary kashmir shaivite      modern commentaries    s radhakrishnan      swami nikhilananda      today were discussing chapter 2 here the dialogue really takes off krishna begins his attempt to persuade arjuna to fight the battle which soon develops into a disscussion of selfcontrol and final liberation krishnas first line of reasoning is simple caste duty and honour arjuna should fight because he is a kshatriya and will lose all prestige if he refuses krishna soon gets more philosophical 213 is a famous summation of the hindu doctrine of reincarnation the embodied self passing from body to body in this chapter krishna explains that the true self is unchanging and eternal a reason why the wise man doesnt mourn for the dead advaita vedanta teachers like shankara identify this unchanging self with the monistic brahmanatman ramanuja identifies it with a theistic god whose body individual selves are part of however the sankyha philosophy that runs through the gita and is mentioned explicitly in 239 is all about ennumerating principles of reality hence 245 mentions the three constituents ie sattva rajas and tamas which can be very roughly translated as pure passionate darkinert these are evolutes of prakriti the origin of mental faculties senses and the material world in later sankhya prakriti is intrinsically distinct from the eternal self or person purusha making it incompatible with monist vedanta theories whether the gita is referring to this dualism of the later systematic sankhya school or the monism of the upanishads and later systematic vedanta school is a matter of serious debate    theres loads more to discuss about this chapter but ill leave that as a starting point for now
everyone is welcome to join the group and discuss the book
  id rather die faggot
  ancient hinduism stuff is redpilled as fuck u brainlet peasant
  based and this
  hes under the impression that the true self can die    maybe if you listened to krshna you could escape from your delusion anon
  too bad its shit now
im at work right now without attachment to its fruits of course but i will be back later with some more analysis theres almost too much to discuss with this chapter the gita is very dense one can appreciate why its such fertile ground for commentary
there are interesting views by the commentators on 212    bs miller translation  never have i not existed  nor you nor these kings  and never in the future  shall we cease to exist    ramanuja says that its saying the personal lord is being described as coeternal along with all the souls in existence this understanding is followed by rc zaehner an influential professor of religion active 19521974 this view accepts a multiplicity of selves though as part of the lord in some sense shankara says the seeming description of multiple selves as referring to the multiplicity of physical bodies meanwhile the absolute self is unchanging     radhakrishnan seems to attempt a synthesis of these views he says it indeed refers to the coeternality of the personal lord and individual sounds but goes on to describe the unchanging brahman self as being behind that apparent multiplicity he cites some very early evidence of the belief in empirical reality being part of the lord which ill quote here    white yajur veda samhita 3119a    radhakrishnan translation  the lord of the beings prajapati travels in the wombs though unborn he is born in many ways    wyv samhita 324    rth griffith translation  this very god pervadeth all the regions yea born aforetime in the womb he dwelleth  he verily born and to be born hereafter meeteth his offspring facing all directions
is the discord dedicated to just this or is it a general /lit/ discussion server
24244 has an interesting criticism of obsession with vedic ritual that the committed ritualists are concerned with rewards and will simply continue their cycle of rebirths 246 famously sums up this view with the pithy phrase for the brahmin who knows there is no more purpose in all the vedas than in a watertank surrounded by a flood johnson trans ie a brahmin priestly caste who has achieved true wisdom has no need for vedic rituals this is a view very much in common with the upanishads called the end of the veda vedanta because they lead one to final liberation      just this but it can be for broader hinduism discussion
were done for today and will be discussing chapter 3 next saturday but youre welcome to join the discord or talk in the thread about the first 2 chapters if you want to catch up all without being attached to the fruits of the discussion of course    discussion about the optimal skin color from a vedic perspective is also fine

we never know selfrealization we are two abysses  a well staring at the sky  what did he mean by this

are there infographics on viking literature or norse literature if they didnt make any    primary sources preferred please
i have a ba in scandinavian literature ama    also viking literature isnt a thing the viking age was from 7931066 at which point scandinavians didnt really write
  the saxon stories by bernard cornwell    
  did they have any great epics i can read or cool mythology texts or someone close culturally in that region at least    like was there an iliad or gilgamesh of that region if not where the heck did we learn about the loki and odin and valhalla myths etc
  vikings were subhumans and only christianization allowed the nordic man to elevate himself to a superior being
  why cant i learn about them i dont plan on converting to valhallaism anytime soon you dont have to worry
  theres beo wolf
  best translation
  as far as i know the poetic edda is the only one written by a true believer while the religions were still alive  ibsen has some plays about vikings too  and theres vargs books of course
closest i have seen
  the one with kemp malone
vikings were mostly oral literature
  christianity has given nothing to the world but passivity apathy and weakness the problems of decadence and entitlement in the modern world are a direct result of christianity not the opposite stop fetishizing christianity

 romanovich or romanych   zakharovich or zakaharych  thats useless overcomplification the latter is just a vernacular spelling of the former even though in general usage of such standalone patronyms can be a sign of familiarity dostoevsky simply makes common people talk like common people a good translator should be able to stylize their speech without putting that responsibility on the reader    moreover no one simply had a chance to call razumikhin by his full name dmitry prokofievich so hes not some exception neither are svidrigailov or all women ivanovna can be shortened to ivanna etc    in other words what a shitty job
  based and redpilled translator they should do something like this for one hundred years of solitude

if you dont read through philosophy chronologically then you dont fully understand your favorite philosopher even if you think you do
  
thanks for the two pictures anon theyre quite helpful   can you post more by any chance   i dont have anything to say though all those isms confuse me so i never got into philosophy
  not op but if youre interested in learning the history and basic ideas of the major thinkers chronologically philosophize this is a high quality/entertaining and accessible podcast
  am op but all i found is this which is combining the two and adding women    image too large
  1 there is no proper way to understand/do philosophy   2 why does the history of eastern philosophy lack any contemporary thinkers
   no contemporary  is the eastern world dead
    im not the one that made the infographics i just found them online
    why didnt eastern philosophy or nonwestern philosophies take off as they did in the west were the western philosophers coming up with too much and couldnt explain it without developing a new paradigm did the others just keep it simple because thats all thats important anyway
  thank you i listened to it a bit and it seemed good still its my first podcast so i dont know what to expect trying two new things in life at once     thats actually amazing thank you too anon
  eastern philosophy has deeply influenced western philosophy but i imagine having a different mindset leads to different interpretations on the problem of life
  how mistaken dont read philosophy pre1920 just read the sep entries for them its useless really they didnt go piecemeal like the philosophers of today additionally not all philosophy is continental
  first of all its somewhat misleading calling the eastern tradition of thinking philosophy as philosophy is a wholly unique form of western thought based on a conception of metaphysics namely as being as beingly sein als seiendes and the logic of the groundsentence nihil es sine ratione  eastern thought doesnt follow this mode of thinking therefore it is wrong to try and syncretize it under the western branch of philosophy as we loose the uniqueness and fundamental experience of total otherness    if we follow spengler we could call eastern thought dead as the culture which gave them birth have flowered and the metaphysical conceptions brought to the natural end of stillness
those pictures are highly flawed
nice spooks nerd
modern mathematicians do not have to read euclid in order to gain cuttingedge knowledge of mathematics  modern physicists do not need to familiarize themselves with publications by newton to understand quantum mechanics   the strength of mankind is in our ability to optimize and compile things effectively giving the next generation a greater insight in smaller intervals of time   in the same way if a philosopher cannot intergrate previous data in his works in effective readable and innovative way such philosopher is redundant and meaningless and shouldnt be read anyway
  why dont you guys just think for yourselves instead of filling your heads with the thoughts of others who you have every same facility in yourself and reality outside yourself to determine the nature of this world i abandoned reading some time ago and my period of personal unmediated reflection since has shown me greater truths than i ever saw before     you dont need any other person to tell you the nature of this reality you can figure it all out by yourself without even a single book its much quicker too than having to read through an encyclopedia like op posted
implying most of those philosophers read others in an autistically linear fashion
  6/10
  completely wrong  your favorite philosopher  even he didnt read through philosophy chronologically  even he didnt properly understand his own favorite philosophers if that ever makes sense
  wasnt baiting but alright go ahead and live thinking that if it werent for the books around you you could never become wise by that logic no one could have ever become wise in the first place as theyd have needed books to make them so and an infinite regress is therefore needed    ill say it again you have everything in yourself to understand the nature of reality your soul is directly connected to the reality you live in books are thw secondary containers of the firsthand knowledge of their authors but your soul is the primary container of any knowledge that can ever enter a book
    i agree with you on some points but disagree when you say reading is useless searching for philosophical constructs that make sense is an enormously hard effort and analysing all the constructs people have created before you can serve as a huge help
  have you ever read the treatise of ogoola ooonga   thought so
  not saying it is useless merely reminding the people of this thread that you shouldnt feel that you need to read mountains of works in chronological order to understand reality you really neednt do that and it may end up a waste of time in the end my position is that one should always spend more time reflecting than reading after all reading is merely the act of receiving anothers reflections so why not simply reflect for yourself and only after doing so consistently does reading have value for you can compare the reflections of those you read with those of your own    i do agree with you the existing written works can save oneself a lot of time from having to start from scratch giving oneself a shortcut to truth platos thoughts for example have helped me immensely but i see ops approach of starting from the very beginning and reading every single school of thought in chronological order to be the opposite of what youve just said
  youre right though i made it seem like i was antireading  im not at all but ill always place reflection above reading since the first is a primary source of knowledge while the latter is by nature secondary reading should merely be a companion to your own thoughts and not a substitute
start with plato end with stirner
  youre telling people to figure it out themselves what and ignore 2000 years of education everyone knows you should read and also take breaks to contemplate your comment assumes a basic level of education before figuring it out yourself otherwise youre just advocating the worst trashy ignorance

/lit/s thoughts on this    opinions seem to be split i think whether you enjoy this or not depends on whether youre familiar with the work it alludes to
  it alludes to so much work to the point of being excruciating
      what does it allude to i mean im familiar with wittgenstein but not to the extent that i catch references to specific works   but i enjoyed it good book   bernhards correction is like the same thing but better
  classics mostly and a bunch of philosophy but i doubt you need to know any of it to enjoy the book    never heard of that correction book sounds good
how does nobody know of this book

lolita i just couldnt handle his ramblings
all of these i stopped reading more than halfway through from boredom  monkey wrench gang  the symposium  lolita  crime and punishment  mobydick  the house of seven gables  the sun also rises  as i lay dying  gravitys rainbow  the grapes of wrath  walden  dune  rendezvous with rama  the martian chronicles  a princess of mars  the foundation series  process and reality  the birth of tragedy
  i took no pleasure in dune but its required reading for all stemlords
the sportswriter boring  the tunnel difficult     there are a few ive opened but quit fewer than 5 pages into it these include suttree and im a cormac fan the stand and the cantos
  funnily enough suttree stops being such torture after the first five pages you might lose patience with it later but its a pretty fun book
  rayuela
  moby dick was really good you could skim until the last few chapters def worth reading
  the grapes of wrath gets better lolita is worth finishing too
bonfire of the vanities i read 600 of 700 pages and thought to myself well theres no way this is going to get interesting in the space it has left
ulysses trying again now im up to the sirens chapter but havent picked it up for a couple of weeks
      i hate this place
  i actually loved it i read it as a poem instead of a normal novel and that made it work really well its a beautiful love story one of my favorites
  couldnt finish tunnel or naked lunch just unreadable
i cant seem to finish lord of the rings i want to get it in english maybe its the translation that doesnt work for me  riddley walker  tale of genji its too boring  1q84
  wuthering heights is good shit tho
  that
  the scarlet letter    it was the only book i used sparknotes for in school and i was the kid who would read otherclasses books
  the devil in the white city the informational stuff was good but the writing for the killers parts were cliched as fuck
  ah war and punishment by leodor tolstoyevsky good taste monsieur
  yikes those are easy reads
  i couldnt get through snow crash because the premise was too dumb  oh he looked at 1s and 0s and got a virus and this is possible because he has experience with high level programming languages
  the revolution of everyday life by vanegem  it felt too all over the place  les eblouissements by mertens  it was boring
  atlas shrugged i still plan on finish it some day just not today or tomorrow
  i was really enjoying but those endless descriptions of whales were too much for me i might try again later
    this   i think camus only good work is the rebel because he makes some genuinely good points about 20th century politics and the dangers of nihilism always found his fiction ridiculously heavy handed as if hes slapping you around the face with the point in every paragraph
    each to their own but i am finding it really difficult to see how half of these can be described as boring especially crime and punishment
parades end by ford madox ford i loved the good soldier too
  probably all of kant books  moby dick  the iliad  the magic mountain   the old books of the bible  the coran  the third book by rabelais in old french  process and reality

  the republic  so fucking tedious
  the fact that you were bored reading as i lay dying means you must be a ya pleb you need to develop some patience or just stop trying to read literature
  its legitimately fucking boring this is the stereotypical book that is required reading for a college syllabus    sword of shannara   the summer tree  a clockwork orange only because im a brainlet want to finish it someday  a few of the enders game numerous prequels and side stories
  i agree sometimes the little inner monologues roskolnikov goes on can get so tedious it took all i could muster to finish it
  a princess of mars and the others are a childhood favorite of mine lmao    war and peace is my number one book im too intimidated by to read attempted it twice and havent since i need time and a whiteboard to list all the characters and actions russian names are difficult to keep track of especially as a nonslav
  a clockwork orange  this novel goes from okay to great with the final chapter of the full uncut british version for some reason the american version removed it because theyre too pleb to understand it
  truly a classic
  why what did you not like about it
tess of durbervilles far too boring and sjw
  honestly pal the best way to keep up with all the russian names and multiple nicknames is to just read more russians reading shorter russian novels and building up to the long boys is a pretty good way of going about it    at the very least depending on your edition some books with have a guide to the names and if not im sure you can google them im gonna finally go for war  peace in 2019 my dude wish me luck
i rage quit it after maybe 75 pages it was bafflingly bad and all the more annoying because the professional book reviewers of the world had assured me that its the new great american novel    and funnily enough i never hear anybody mention this book nor do i see anyone reading it
board tourist here i never finished any book not even school stuff read a few chapters here and there but always ended up getting the summary on the internet   lately i tried to force myself into read a few classics but i quit every time nothing seems to do it for me    how do you do it lads
  into reading
  same here i made it like 3/4 of the way through though    also dune but that was a long time ago
  books you never finished  my magnum opus t_t
  understandable the tangents drag on
        it wasnt the monologues of the book nor the tediousness of it after all i read brothers k anna karenina the year and a half prior it was the fact that i got too busy with life that i couldnt pick it up and read it again     ill get back on rereading the whole thing as part of my newyears resolution

  low iq person who doesnt understand the fundamental heteronomy that the yoke of ephemeral and base pleasure confines man under
so free will isnt valued anymore
oh geez i love this book so much its all about the quality of life and ignorance they say ignorance is bliss but theres a difference between heartfelt joy and bliss and i think it was very much a commentary about like true happiness just because were numbed out and are conditioned to think everything is holly and jolly doesnt mean that were at the best world we could be
  is happiness more important than freedom
  dystopia as a genre is often misunderstood and misused today because of the plague that is juvenile fiction and people aping 1984 a proper dystopia is a deconstruction of a perfect place in which one takes an ideal or ideologys proclaimed endpoint and show how terrible place to live in even when all of its precepts are followed in both the letter and the spirit    brave new world and its predecessor we take the popular notions of the 1920s such as taylorism freudian psychology and planned societies and implements them in the exact ways people like the fabian society or early soviet state advocated to demonstrate the fundamental shortcomings of their ideologies in that light zamyatin and huxley add new meaning to the pun in the world utopia these good places will always be no places because no one will actually want to live in them if given an informed choice
  according to /sci/ free will doesnt exist and everything is reducible to chemicals in the brain     freedom leads to happiness therefore happinessfreedom

  only select people get to live in that society the rest are deformed workers or savages the people are kept so selfindulged to the point that they simply refuse to do anything of value or individualistic the leaders literally control the people with sex and drugs

  i own a first edition of this book that was part of a library collection on an ocean liner    whoever is reading this make sure you read brave new world revisited by the same author
  nice b8 4/10 bc i replied  i have major depression with psychosis comitted suicide and failed went an entire year in a state of druginduced panic and wanted to throw myself into traffic at every moment i had to have my mom watch me pretty much 24/7   but guess what i dont drink or do drugs aside from the ones that keep away psychosis and even then i am weaning myself off of it over time i do this because living life as a vegetable even if it makes you feel good disgusts me having no agency and no freedom to push yourself or improve yourself is something only a loser stoner would want   go ahead and whine about how your wife left you or you have depression or how you have a small dick and tell me all about how medical marijuana is the cure for everything ive met hundreds of people like you theyre all the same and they all make me sick theyre the people that trade freedom for safety and sterility
  hedonistic pig    yeah and a bunch of filthy transhumanists who want to reduce us to brains in a vat or succeed in some power fantasy of big brained super athletes cyborgs
  i have a similar story psychotic bipolar/psychotic depression/ psychosis )))   interested in meeting another psychotic   not sure really what to ask  what is your interest in lit
  designing a creature with selfconsciousness over its own meaningless and purposeless existence  nature is a dirty fucking cheating whore
  just do heroin fagget
  nothing about that post was difficult to understand
  freedom leads to happiness therefore happinessfreedom  what sort of retarded logic is that  freedom may lead to happiness but you can have happinessto some level with no freedom if freedom always ensures happiness then it is more important than happiness itself  idk why there has to be always some kind of special retard that reads the novel/distopia and tries to go agaisnt the current of the message just to try to flex on the others and spit out nihilistic and hedonistic shit  go read brave new world revisited if you want to get a closer look at the points the novel warn us about  also would like to mention that your idea of paradise is completly relative and may not be equal for everyone the novel portrays this very clearly that there is no space for more than that
    cant end sentences with prepositions  english is neither a hellenic nor romance language so stop pushing this fake rule made up by inbred anglos that were looking for new ways to jerk off to themselves
  just because there are some people living like shit it doesnt mean that life should be all about pleasure in the way the novel and the normies portray there needs to be balance in the freedom and the confort trying to make things into absolutes and black or white is utterly retarded  that is the same partner logic of bruh there are people in africa starving right now you have no right to complain      one of the best replies in this thread op is just trying to come off as a pseud faggot that sees things in a diferent way
    to be fair you have to have a very high iq to understand rick and morty the humor is extremely subtle and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewers head theres also ricks nihilistic outlook which is deftly woven into his characterisation  his personal philosophy draws heavily from narodnaya volya literature for instance the fans understand this stuff they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes to realize that theyre not just funny they say something deep about life as a consequence people who dislike rick and morty truly are idiots of course they wouldnt appreciate for instance the humour in ricks existencial catchphrase wubba lubba dub dub which itself is a cryptic reference to turgenevs russian epic fathers and sons im smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as dan harmons genius unfolds itself on their television screens what fools how i pity them and yes by the way i do have a rick and morty tattoo and no you cannot see it its for the ladies eyes only and even they have to demonstrate that theyre within 5 iq points of my own preferably lower beforehand
   the book is about a paradoxal society where men become slaves to their ideals and to their desires at the same time in either case the end result is a human who is not truly happy nor truly depressed only a meaningless existence who even worse than being meaningless cant find meaning in life humans are ultimately reduced to cattle while the infinitely tiny minority constantly deviates their minds with drugs from their mechanized lifeless society   at the end of the book it is clear that in the search of a painless society the fords understood that a painless life is a meaningless life and thats what they chose turn people into mechanized cattle deviate everyone from their surroundings make everything soft and easy remove all thorns and the counteranswer to this is to do the very opposite embrace the thorns of life carry your weight suffer all you must suffer and be truly happy and amused by this world

  being a literal slave to your senses  paradise  did someone turn summer back on
  masturbates everyday  listens to music 7 hours a day  every other week eats 1 fruit/vegetable saturated with pesticides  free time he doesnt spend consuming tv/movies/games with friends online he spends posting the same shit everyday on a mongolian cartoon forum with online stranger    i dont have a face condescending enough to post with this
  he thinks he has control over his pleasureseeking nature
  let him have his larp he obviously knows if hes wasting his time on 4chan no need to be rude
jesus christ everyone fell for the most obvious b8 im done with /lit/ for today

  pain is to be overcome
bernard is sooo me lol
  everyone is high and having orgies all the time its literally paradise  are you 16 years old
  whats so good and important about free will when happiness and pleasure is the alternative
what is the worst you all have done to the physical embodiments of ideas ill start    my first kindle was the best generation gen 3 before touch bullshittery overtook the tactile tradition its size was its strength and to this day it remains the strongest heaviest kindle and it has an audio jack for listening to music while you read like a patrician it was stepped on in my alma maters theatre silently dead nothing but a broken screen an artifact the geek squad wouldnt touch the sophists  i once found a copy of new moon in which i currently store ink when traveling it took some epoxy  my current kindle is a bullshit touch with some garbage menu designed to make me buy from amazon and a nonresponsive screen it currently has three infuriating sharpie lines and severely deformed plastic near said lines from my various attempts to remove them including hairspray expo markers isopropryl acetone olive oil vinegar strong spirits and goo gone i fucking hate this thing how in the hell did googone not remove the sharpie ink on the screen and also why arent there buttons you motherfuckers i want to fucking punch whoever designed this piece of shit really cheap as fuck and born to die my god
  how did you get sharpie on the screen

saw a mug of this on amazon    there are two types of people those who can extrapolate incomplete data
  those who are horny and those who are horny and lonely
cunny
  wouldnt you want to extrapolate complete data who would want to extrapolate incomplete data
  i guess you shouldve extrapolated that those who can extrapolate incomplete data was incomplete it should be those who can extrapolate from incomplete data
  i think it should read those who can extrapolate incomplete data and those who dont and obviously youre extrapolating the those who dont data from the incomplete original sentence
  if its complete why would you need to extrapolate it
  dont

  discovering their sexuality  enough with this overused meme phrase return to the reddit theres nothing to discover if you dont already know what it is by puberty then youre mentally ill you cant even explore your sexuality if you think about it youre just doing the same thing over and over again and that my friends is the definition of insanity
  literally this    im pretty sure that when liberals talk about discovering sexuality they mean various forms of sexual assault
  it really is just a nicer way of saying becoming a slut

  hes still a bad writer
    epic simply epic
      youre an idiot
absalom absalom and essentially the premise of everything that faulkner ever wrote his entire body of work is about the south during and after the civil war and how southerners are dealing with the loss of the war and the way society changes after it
if thou must love me let it be for nought   except for loves sake only do not say   i love her for her smile  her look  her way   of speaking gently  for a trick of thought   that falls in well with mine and certes brought   a sense of pleasant ease on such a day   for these things in themselves belovèd may   be changed or change for theeand love so wrought   may be unwrought so neither love me for   thine own dear pitys wiping my cheeks dry   a creature might forget to weep who bore   thy comfort long and lose thy love thereby   but love me for loves sake that evermore   thou mayst love on through loves eternity
is there anything like this for spanish
  hey op hey why dont you look it up
  sorry for some reason i thought there were only french and german versions
  i think its someone else who does the spanish edition so dont go in expecting the same format   
so your favourite german poet isnt hölderlin anon
    is that emily isnt she 13
i told you to stop calling me that
its trakl the hold is fine
  i cant believe hes dead
  its my wife
actually looks like dylan klebold thats who she reminds me of
you cant even read german u dumb thot
  no u
  german  poet    literally the ugliest language in the western hemisphere
  willingly admitting to being nonwhite
  not danish
  that would be dutch
  fairly sure that germany is in the eastern hemisphere my ameritard friend
  oh no no no no
  sorry sweety the germans dont have enough emotions to be poets
  hard to say hölderlin is nice but i find him a tad overrated early göethe is definitely up there
  kek this germany is on the spectrum
  being this proud about this lack of knowledge of world culture
  he has never read kierkegaard in the original
  implying implications
  kikeguard  good  loving every laugh
  im sorry to hear that you didnt understand what you read
  never heard portuguese
i dont get it
was atlantis real
  on this timeline yes
  yeah ive been a few times not very impressive the receptionist was pretty cute though so i initially thought it would be great she led me into this waiting room where i sat for an ungodly amount of time until finally i was led into the admissions office where i sat for yet another long ass time i got up and left a bit later
tell us of your literary sins ill start   i skipped the entirety of book 23 of the iliad
  i didnt finish the iliad and havent read the odyssey i read moby dick all on my iphone in the book app heart of darkness too
  why didnt you finish it anon yes its dull at times but there are some brilliant moments
  i believe medieval literature philosophy and art is better than the greeks and romans    i self insert    ive read more pages talking about the bible than there are pages in the bible i never read the bible    i like boccaccio more than dante    ive never read any post ww2 literature yet still shitpost about it    i only read english    i dont like shakespeare
i wrote cringey ff7 fanfiction when i was 13
  anger
  i cant focus when i read so i often reread even simple sentences a couple of times before i understand the meaning
  me too anon
  get rid of your smart phone
  and i though i was alone my double my brother
i think due to /lit/s anglocentricity everyone should read their national essential /lit/ and then /lit/ from other countries of the same language and only then go on to the books recurrently memed around here
   only read english  actually triggered     mine is ive never actually read 1984 only got bored after a few chapters and skimmed through it around the age of 13 never went back to it too much shit id rather read ill get to it someday maybe after finishing proust
  this happens to me most often in the first few pages of reading when im still getting my head there or when i need a break    with some writers like kafka i find myself doing this constantly though i feel i read every sentence twice with his work
  im trying to do this
i skipped pretty much the entire time humbert was seperated from dolores is lolita  it was so fucking boring
  in lolita
  nah too much good lit from russia and france alone not waiting to read fucking paradise lost first  you should go in the order of difficulty of comprehension a lot of foreign translated literature is more beginner/intermediate friendly a lot of realist and romanticist works i think are better read before most modernist works for example because its easier to get and almost all of the best realist work at least is not anglo    yes meaning is lost in translation but that doesnt matter much for most writers that get memed around here aside from a few like proust as they wouldnt be so memed if their strengths didnt survive translation
i dont read books i write them
  back in my teens i liked to read south park fanfic im a straight guy  i still go back to it every now and then
  i dont remember having read it but i guess i did
i secretly took pride in having literary taste when i read a /his/ thread or post i cant refute    i secretly take pride in having some knowledge in history when i am on /lit/ and noticed that there are many essentials i didnt read
  must write shitty books if you dont read
havent read any lit from my country  didnt start with the greeks
  so you didnt read the best part of the novel where humbert has a slapstick wrestling match with the guy who kidnapped lo
  i still listen to harry potter audiobooks whenever i get anxiety sometimes i even curl up and pretend im 13 again im op btw 
i dont know where to start reading but i still shitpost
  anon whyd you have to call me out like that
i got to the oxen of the sun chapter of ulysses and stopped right there
i believe books are a zionist conspiracy and as such i dont read
i write poetry but ive never read the odyssey or the iliad or any dante
      there should be a sticky that says active reading you mother fuck
  shut up cuck
  unironically pope is harder to read than milton you fall in with the iambs and shakespeares sonnets are way harder to parse than a narrative like paradise lost
  its a very quick read an afternoon at most
  i havent read a book from start to finish since 10th grade     im in my 3rd year of undergrad 
over the years i wrote a total of 280k words of what should only have beena 10k fantasy comingofage story that started out as an online roleplay idea 65 of it is dubcon sex scenes turned murder btw
i self insert into my sex scenes would be fine to an extent desu if it werent for the fact i almost exclusively write thriller/horror genreshit with lots and i do mean lots of graphic rape these days
i jerked off over the eve of st agnes by keats the bit where he was writing about eating quince and dates made m hard as diamonds
  i only secretly take pride in those things because i know if i actually post something i will get my ass kicked
ive read gravitys rainbow twice and still dont really get parts of it
  this has been the core of my identity for some years now i used to browse a fiction forum in a time i felt i need an identity back then i had a strong urge to be a special person and i had this anxiety that when i see people whom i cant agree with     so when i read a story with heavy historical reference and setting i criticized its style when i was on another forum i began to refer to things i learned from that forum     this anxiety and experience actually affected my majoring choice and led to expulsion from school     some years later i began to have more stable reading habit and actually did some reading its still basically the same i read much more history than i read literature but i dont study either of them systematically i let literature to be my guide to read more history   the only difference is that i have less anxiety about identity crisis for now
  havent read any lit from my country  no biggie if youre american
  i read biography of and commentary about a writer without actually reading his works
my favourite thing to read is romantic zelda fan fics on fanfictionnet when im a bit tipsy good fun
  then we will have nothing to talk about   books memed here are the books people have a common ground with
the past few books ive read i skipped a bunch of shit cause it was all boring  i also skip a shit ton in philosophy too cause its also boring
  yes that happens after hes reunited with her
  i dont know what book 23 of the iliad is
  why even read it in the first place then
  mind youre own binnus
  
  im a slow reader    my thoughts are often more interesting than reading  my mind can cook soup on nearly any single page of a book for about forty minutes if i allow it so i often forget to read
every time i start writing a story i begin with great ideas then make them too complex and give up
  faulkner is bad this isnt a confession i just wanted to say that his works are insipid and fanbase universally underachieving english majors and /fitlit/ subhumans the most famous passages associated with his works are inferior to passing remarks older /lit/ users have graced us with fuck you if you read faulkner
  funeral games for patroclus
  i hate that im wasting my time replying to you im seething right now
  i also do this with writing and with life   ithurtsjpg      i fell short of my goal in nano this year by 10000 words i said i was only participating for a lark but it still hurts if only because i wanted to win so badly  still gonna finish my shitty novel though
skipped the final few chapters of war and peace loved the book but couldnt stand tolstoys deterministic rant
  you are wrong
i pretend to know what i am talking about
    i think there are multiple guides from academics that admit themselves as incomplete so this isnt a sin
  i only read english  in all honesty are there people here that really go through the effort of learning another language to the point of being fluent in it just in order to read one book or two
  i havent written a thing worth a damn in years ive let everyone who believed in me down all i can do is write lyrics for my stupid band i wanted more than this dammit
  i quit the book when she confessed she was not a virgin anymore
i read quite a few books at once because i love starting them
i posted this in another thread before it got archived but i stopped reading cp at around page 125 that was over 7 years ago
  me too that shit was boring as hell maybe my cheap dover tranny was just ass tho idk
    at that point the novel is basically just raskolnikov murdering some woman how is that boring
  i read all books on phone lmao
i feel intellectually intimidated by big brains
  i didnt see it as boring i thought it was interesting as hell life got in the way
i actually worked at the job instead of read more for like 12 minutes
  theres nothing wrong with reading books on your phone particularly for fiction i find it really nice to download samples from amazon before purchasing anything
i do not like anything the greeks have written and think epics like eddas and sagas and other western european tales have more substance than homeric epics  i also find greek mythology fundamentally profane and the basis for lots of contemporary pathologies of thought and culture
  i didnt see it as boring though life got in the way to the point that i couldnt finish it
  i am a dumb fucking nigger insulting our lord satan by wasting these trips
  if the language is widely used why not
  fair enough id recommend giving it another go dostoyevsky is an immensely entertaining author
  yeah but i start it and get bored and think id rather spend this time reading x book and its not challenging in a way that would feel satisfying to complete and understand like a difficult book  same problem with a clockwork orange its even shorter being half the size but i cant seem to make it past chapter 3 i just dont care about reading it other than just to say ive read it
  this dosto was what started my interest in lit read a lot in my younger teens but mainly scifi/fantasyesque work and lost interest in reading by the time i was an adult   at around 21 i went from reading like 4 books in 2 years to reading most of his canonical work in a month because i got so absorbed read a lot of other shit after/since then but his work gave me the momentum
  i skipped the rollcall portion of the iliad but not in the aeneid
  i really want to read this
  oh i know this feel i always start with a simple ideia and then ended up with some abstract shit who doesnt even make sense most of the time
  tfw feel unable to type out my depraved ideas because of paranoia about them being read by someone
  everytime i start a story i have solid ideas about specific scenes and characters and words but seem unable to build the basic setting stuff that barely matters   thing is given a prompt and purpose i have no issue and like to play with it to stretch the prompt further than was probably meant to suit my needs  given complete choice im paralysed
  how big is your phone  i only do it when i really want to immediately read something i dont have on hand for some reason i find it really uncomfortable reading books that way even though ive been reading other shit on my phone for years
  you probably never will but thanks      pro tip truecrypt and a dedicated netbook for writing
  dedicated netbook for writing  this is what i already do as no one seems to be able to read my handwriting except me    look up truecrypt  truecrypt is discontinued  thanks though anon  ill consider it but i think its more an irrational aversion
  im a programmer and hide my despicable smut under eight layers of weirdly named database folders if someone manages to actually find it they arguably earned the right to read it lmao
  i havent read shakespeare aside from some of his sonnets
  you are only hurting yourself anon
  watch some adaptions of shakespeare will only take a few hours and its meant to be watched anyway
  if someone manages to actually find it they arguably earned the right to read it lmao  filerecently opened
  got any recs
  automated deletion of editing history on closing
  just making sure you were covered anon
i read books but i dont actually think about them
  sometimes i will read an entire book and realise i got nothing out of it at all usually a novel recently it was the trial all i thought at the end was bureaucracy bad
only read in english and im not really ashamed about it    100 believe that stephen king and a lot of mass thriller airport paperback writers have more literary merit than academic postmodern giants salems lot is a smarter and more beautiful book than anything donald barthelme has ever written character conflict narrative and dialogue are essential to compelling writing and the good postmodern writers like pynchon knew this    have fairly racist views about literary culture sincerely believe its controlled by jews who reward mediocrities because their last name begins with gold sincerely believe that black people struggle to tell interesting and thoughtful stories not sure why anybody pretends to enjoy james baldwin and toni morrison find the poetry of maya angelou hilariously bad
  i dont think ive ever read a book written by a black person
i only started reading anything other than thrillers a year ago i read literature now but dont have any opinions of my own i let other people decide for me which books are good
 i have infinite jest gravitys rainbow finnegans wake among others on my book backlog am i just a meme/spoilers
  why are you posting here then
   also as you can see i lurk a lot and dont post very much
  but dont have any opinions of my own i let other people decide for me which books are good  you should listen to both the judgement of others with more experience and your own likes   the art that will stay with you over the years is that which you truly enjoyed and/or found something in even if you later think its not all that you can defend your original opinion with what you felt at the time while youll look back with embarrassment at the time you pretended to love x which didnt really do that much for you but you liked the idea of being a fan of it    but while you can have your own opinions on works should defer judgement on great works in the canon or youll sound pretty silly when you say x is a hack/for pseuds straight up not liking something that has gone down as a true classic by the best literary minds is almost a sign of not getting it thinking its merely not as great as its reputation is different and fine imo there will works that you wont get but if you keep reading and expanding your tastes youll likely find will click someday its okay to leave something and come back to it later
  we all do that thats why this is a pseudpool anon
    i have been accumulating a collection of classic books and poems that i want to read but i havent had time to read them    the fabliau is one of my favorite forms of writing    old and middle english is superior to greek and roman     american lit is fucking garbage except for a handful of writers    why no one has done a true to book adaptation of the divine comedy or canterbury tales is beyond me    chaucer is the greatest english writer
  thanks for the response anon i will admit that its sometimes hard for me to get some literature shakespeare for example just a matter of me not being a very skilled reader yet i suppose
i have mild dyslexia and my job consists of writing everyday i spend too much time googling common words to ensure they are spelled right
  why no one has done a true to book adaptation of the divine comedy  i bet its all the protestants fault
  keep coming back to it i think for shakespeare the barrier is mainly just elizabethan english  once you get past that hes very entertaining remember shakespeare wrote for the masses  but yeah my rule of thumb is to reach for what appeals to me while still striving to challenge myself and expand my tastes   youve got years to learn to appreciate more difficult literature
  truecrypt is discontinued  yeah so what its not a super complex javascript interpreter prone to exploits  besides corrupt politicians paedophiles and terrorists have twarted investigators with it it should be enough for things you just dont want friends to read    just download tc 71 from different places and compare them all to hashes posted in some renowed blogs steve gibsons for one i could tell me the hashes from the exe i have since before the original site took them down but why should you trust me anyway
i used to write selfinsert pornography about my favorite anime characters raping me when i was 1416 years old
i read the presocratics then skipped past plato to the 18th century needless to say i crawled back to plato
im writing my first novel its a fantasy romance novel about a young knight and a tsundere warrior princess im about 25k words into it and think ill wrap it up at 50k    i find sexuality repulsive i find literary descriptions of sex particularly get under my skin even vague allusions irk me
  not him but imo start with a midsummer nights dream othello and the winters tale
  i dont read books i read /lit/ threads and boards and shitpost about authors foreheads rather than the content of books
i refuse to read any fiction released after 1995
i keep a legitimate diary and have a bookshelf full of books i dont think ill actually read
  the biggest fault you can do is reading for other people like to impress them or something related the same counts if you impose yourself standards that are influenced by other people instead find stuff that you truly enjoy by yourself or which gives you something that you can relate to personally and contemplative its not a sin to skim through stuff early on to find the right material
  theres nothing cringy about that      i dont read ive read like 15 books in my life and several of them were audiobooks      now that ive admitted what i am i cant be a key witness in your cringy fanfic trial 
  i just tried 1984 and tapped out about halfway through holy shit that book sucks
  its an okay book nothing really terrible about it the problem is that the most important part of the book is also the most boring and dry part
  i am the very definition of a pseudointellectual i take almost every piece of literature at second hand value because i cant be arsed to read it i dont read books anymore i simply listen to them on audiobook i listened to the brothers karamazov and master and margarita this way whats worse i fancy myself a writer and have written 66 of a novel however the plot got too complex and i never made a written outline so none of it makes sense and it jumps around from scene to scene
  i dare you to repurpose it into the next huge ya hit
  yes that story of the person who was ordered not to turn around while escaping death but they did any way and was then punished that sure was a profane story
  i meant specific adaptations
  kenneth branaghs adaptations
  im the laziest fuckwit to ever exist on /lit/ i cannot be bothered to finish the books i own and the more books i buy the more gets added to that unfinished pile
  i do the exact same thing anon i spent probably 300 in books on amazon last month which will take me years to get to
  feelsbadman only recently have i actually started to nearly finish one book from my unfinished pile but thats if im not procrastinating my ass off
  i rarely read less than 10 books at the same time and i dont care
guys i have the bad habit of translating in my native language every english phrase i read in a book i do all this in my mind and its exhausting how can i escape this compulsion intended to prove to myself im worthy and get to enjoy the text undistracted
  can someone edit this to say acc or catholicism on the right weeb would work for me too you get the general drive of my disdain for the many forms of subhumans were tasked with exterminating in this darkest of ages any and all help is appreciated
broke my waterman fountain pen i stole back in high school    books for this feel every pen i have left is shite

  do you think so
maybe the worst poem ever penned

no but watching the decline of the west occurring is
how do you differentiate the will to power from just plain old narcissism    lets say you accidentally dent someones car and nobody sees it the will to power response would mean you just drive off before anyone notices instead of subscribing to slave morality by leaving a note and causing your insurance to go up or paying 800 to replace a bumper because its the right thing to do    i guess what im trying to say is as far as actions go what a narcissist would do and what someone following the will to power would do seem like practically the same    not making a value judgment here or saying narcissism is inherently bad just honestly wondering what exactly is the difference
   what a narcissist would do and what someone following the will to power would do  no a narcissist would come up with reasons why it cannot follow the will to power though given perfect circumstances they would have or reasons why they dont care they would not do what is demanded from the will to power or the will to create because one of the defining aspects of narcissism is that being caught up in the fantasy of superiority prevents narcissists from becoming truly superior
  i see so its a matter of commitment and honest selfassessment which the narcissist cant do the ubermensch will not rationalize his selfish acts away to protect his ego
this is a retarded way to do things
  i think youre confusing the translations of terms the will to power is kraft in german while the will to create is how im translating the will zur macht the will to power is not part of becoming an ubermensch because it is the will to control and order and try to shove the square peg that is humanity into a perfectly rounded german engineered hole a narcissist shares some tendencies with the kraft parts but lacks the following through and the ability to forget the past and revoke obligations a lot of their problem is trying to dominate because of this drive but lacking the ability to channel it towards real power the ubermensch on the other hand has a will to create and help others and no need to elevate themselves apart from to help others the term ubermensch is something like mountain climbing instructor/leader and the role is much like a sherpa one who could make it up the mountain quicker but helps others who cant carry their pack and doesnt do it for the glory but to show someone else the mountain top    you should actually read nietzsche instead of just buying black tshirts
  will to power and ubermensch being an universal state of mind    on warriors  you are not great enough to resist hate and jealousy then be great enough to not feel ashamed for them    very clearly there is no singular ubermensch in thus spoke zarathustra he literally spends pages praising traits that are mutually exclusive also your post is drenched in sacrifice for morals pure slave morality an ubermensch is not a leader he is the lightning there is literally an entire passage how zarathrustra does not want a leader with followers he wants comrades 49 of thus spoke nietzsche can have very personal interpretations but you are purposely missing the point     i do not know the answer of your question op the only thing i can tell you is that if you are deeply narcissistic you should make it your virtue without shame
bump
  not op but im gonna think about it shame and fear is far too present in my judgement ultimately clouding it
  its not sacrifice for morals related to the warriors quote the ubermensch isnt showing other people how he got to the mountain top because its better morally or aesthetically its because its there and it kills of notions of it being good or bad or an achievement and makes you realise that all those things are predicted on nobody else getting to see it the people who want to bring others to the same understanding not because it brings them moral superiority or anything else that created curiositys new guise are not jealous of it the idea that the ubermensch is a higher being ignores the reason why he is higher is because he is the one unmotivated by elevating himself and the one capable of elevating others youve missed the entire point of tsz zarathustra is going down the mountain after having been there to tell the village obsessed with heights how they could get there and what its like without the kind of exaggeration that gets you off map but they are too busy trying to force a moral order on to it and make it magical like the circus     it is a process not a moment of entropy which could be considered a universal state of mind the ubermensch being like a mountain leader might be misleading you by this i mean he is the one who is responsible for laying out the line to which you are all attached and the one most likely to fall and have to work back to where hes helped others to get as far as he last pegged well and ubermensch is literally what that position in mountaineering is called tenzing norgay for instance was the ubermensch with hillary which you dont take credit for being first with those youre helping up arent just slowing you down they are also your anchor
the will to power is something which transcends individual nodes of life and justifies life you really dont have to make excuses for your existence it is not the foundation of an ethics nor a metaphysical entity which one can tap into it is simply what makes life possible and should be appreciated as such
    sounds like to you guys are saying the same thing comrades not followers
  the will to power response would mean you just drive off before anyone notices  like a coward
itt overrated literature series    game of thrones more like game of edgy teenage nihilism haha
i think its good
  i think youre dumb
i think its the best literature of the 21st century
will he ever finish it
anyone who actually thinks asoiaf is better than lotr are unironically mentally impaired
  its better because its older  dude
  it isnt perfect in the beginning its pretty flawed actually but you think thats okay the premise is good it will improve and then before you know it everyone is having everyone elses baby and murdering their mother who is also their sister and a schizophrenic and traveling around on horseback setting things on fire for no apparent reason    its a fucking soap opera for litfags
  its better because its newer  bro
  not what he implied nigger
    what makes you think lotr is better than got then if lotr came out today you would trash it and admit how much better got is
  what the fuck where are you pulling these assumptions from  lotr is better because its mythology is more fleshed out and it has more to offer theme wise than edgy nihilism  and honestly i know this opinion isnt popular but i think lotr portrays more realistic characters than got theres plenty of moral grayness in lotr and it bests got by not being afraid to depict people who are genuinely good such people do in fact exist and got is lacking for pretending that they dont such people are also harder to convincingly write since you have to keep their actions consistent
  why dont the have better cover art
  you didnt have to get so angry i was just saying it kind of casually    lotr portrays more realistic characters  it barely even portrays characters every portrayal of a character boils down to  blah blah blah said frodo   he said  as they were walking they felt rather cold    the characters have no personality im not trying to be deep and i literally dont give a shit about muh character development i like lotr but they literally have no personality this is a fact
  blah blah blah said frodo  based
  he expects personality to come from dialogue  wew
  no i dont i expect personality to come from anywhere in the book it does not come at all though
  then youre a brainlet
  youre just messing with me surely you have a better argument than that
  im not going to waste my time typing out the multitude of examples where personality comes through in lotr if you read it like you claim to and came to the impossible conclusion that there is never even an instance of personality then yes you are a brainlet and thats all i need to say
  im not going to prove it but youre wrong  lol
  coming from the guy whos extent of an argument is   blah blah blah said frodo   kys
  blah blah blah said frodo  kek
blah blah blah said 
  how exactly is got edgy nihilism can someone explain
  if you had read these books while having a brain you would have noticed that theres a little bit more going on than nihilism
  you must be new here pal /lit/ will hate anything thats popular
  moral greyness in lotr  no not at all the evil people are evil because theyre evil and the good people are good because theyre good theres no choice a reader can make on who he wants to support barring psychopaths everybody is going to pick the good side    got doesnt depict people who are genuinely good  you clearly havent read the books or watched the series  ned stark robb stark targeryan etc are all characters that are morally good and have a million times more depth to them than say frodo or gandalf
  hating popular things doesnt make you smart or interesting
sunset found her squatting
harry potter sucks
  liking popular things will never make stacy like you
  yeah but whats the point of good characters with depth if the story sucks
is any of it even nihilistic      no
  oh yeah theres also sex haha so adult haha look at all this rape were so mature and cynical for enjoying this complex morally gray entertainment 
can anyone tell me the name of the boardgame they play in got
  it takes a very empty and modern view of the important events institutions and so on of the middle ages
  haha damn this is really funny i mean fuck my goddamn sides man my fucking sides are split in half like who in the fuck can even think about coming up with something funnier than that jesus h fuck i need a break from this goddamn website it is seriously killing my ability to hold my own fucking shit ass cunt bitch fuck tits balls cum damn piss
  being a plotfag  theres your problem
  lotr is better because its mythology is more fleshed out  what this guy said when you read lotr you get the feeling that the places have history to them and you also get hungry p
  maybe just happy
  there would be no got without lord of the rings martin is just a hack and his books only got popular because of the show
  thats why its good

  go get laid as soon as possible and dont dwell on this emotion     its not its just inherently unstable you can believe whatever you want but countless other species practice something like lifelong pairbonding and there is evidence for it going back tens of thousands of years fag
  this and please please say you immediately left her you did right anon
  yep took me about a year to recover from that stuff because i dwelld so much on it it gets easier much much easier and is not at all as painful after some time but the memory will be there always dwelling on how they never take any responsibility and are able to cope much better than men on top of being able to get laid much easier than men though is not fun

     been putting off ak from my stack for a ages now ill give it a try  thanks anons ill give all of them a look u guys are best x
blah blah blah said frodo  who the fuck thought these books were good
game of thrones  literal shit  lord of the blah blah blah    jannies can eat a fucking dick for censoring my opinions
  blah blah blah said faggot op  who the fuck thought this thread was good
  youre a little bitch
  ive tried so many times to read this tome and i just cant fucking finish it i just find myself reading other books
  its not my faul that you failed at life no reason to let out your bad mood at us
  tfw i laughed at this  should i be worried
  i dont think anyone can blame you dude spends like five chapters just describing the landscapre
  ahead of them were ten mountains the erebhror the ifrandul the farufhnir the hilgentur the
  i have to admit it that becomes somewhat annoying overtime and complicates the reading in a unnecessary way
  lord of the rings is an historians fictional piece its why its discussed so frequently on here we read a lot of nonfiction so tolkiens descriptions of the landscape remind one of the geographical descriptions of herodotus or thucydides and the battle scenes are reminiscent of nearly any historians description of a historical battle     he truly is the thinking mans historian thats why you all dont understand kids
  im a teenage contratian the thread
          stick to comics you immature faggots
  look at this fucking pseud
at the time they were great and unheard of id say the adventure and scope are still great but the writing itself is lacking the time machine is superior fiction
  blah blah blah said every character in every novel ever
  the writing itself is lacking  there is no hope for english majors go back to scrawling in margins you fucking pseud
  the writing itself is lacking  tolkiens prose is great you just have to be in the right mindset to appreciate that its about a timeless archetypal myth about the world as a whole and not expect an actionfilled fantasy adventure about the momenttomoment actions of each character
    the hobbit is unironically his best book thematically and structurally   everything else outside of it with the exception of the silmarillion and the children of hurin are just commentary that guilds the original work    his prose in return of the king is especially flat  the movies improved the trilogy by a country mile  i hope amazon forgets they have the rights to this series however because they will fuck it up
  tolkiens prose is better than any other fantasy prose
  i thought these books were good
  they were okay
well these were two nights down the drain it was like an exercise in refusing closure in frustrating the reader  you read murakami and youre expecting magical realism and then theres a hint or two to the magical what with the dreams and the finnish shit about faeries and the unexplained shit about bad spirits if metaphorical and shiros rape and murder but nothing comes out of it no magic at all then all the shit about shiro doesnt get explained and then you hit chapter 19 and you know its the last one and it keeps on going on and going on about stations which is fine and all but you know one cant tie all the loose ends in one chapter much less one that dedicates like 75 to train stations  and thats exactly what fucking happens no loose end gets tied not even the stuff with his old roastie of a girlfriend  boy am i mad i dont like norwegian wood either but boy did this quickly become my least favorite murakami even though i just finished it 20 minutes or so ago    good thing he went back to writing good shit and killing commendatore is superb and i really cant choose between it and 1q84 for my favorite murakami but seriously give me my two nights back god damn it all
  is killing comendatore really different youve described my exact feelings on reading murakami so far and i think ive completed like 4 of his novels i keep coming back because its comfy
i hear you on all counts murakami when he forgets what a conclusion is is a chore to read
  killing commendatore flows much better than most of his novels and also actually ties things up fairly well
  absolutely it starts slow but at chapter 11 iirc shit starts getting real and its just amazing from there on and it makes you addicted and forces you to keep on reading and then it ends marvelously and you get great closure and then miss the characters      1q84 to though and kafka
  t  youve got to read it again op
    cool i will read it i didnt because i imagined myself at the end of 600 pages like wat once again
  those are my other favorites of his it was neat to see him try so many different things in 1q84 hopefully we get another novel like that one day
  fuck no give me your theory and then maybe we can discuss it but no way am i wasting other two nights in this      i felt like killing commendatore was a lot like 1q84 like he had taken what hed learned/developed from writing 1q84 refined it and thats where killing commendatore comes in  thats why i read colorless tsukuru tazaki because it was released in between those two so i thought it would i could see this evolution taking place but i was wrong boy was i wrong
what are the best examples of books with avantegarde or unorthodox approarches to composition
i have a philosophy question can the erudite redpill philosophers on /lit/ help me i believe asking you learned men who discuss difficult philosophical problems with the irreverent authority that only comes from passionate arduous scholarship will be more expedient than this lass figuring it out on her own  here it comes    i was reading something and forgot where it was i believe the most likely location is in the standford encyclopedia of philosophy somewhere in the pages on either location and mereology or plural quantification or their citations but i dont remember as i was very high spinning around could be anywhere and prehaps it was in some journal it was about someone who wrote about the mind as existing in context it sounds very similar to what peirce says about mind existing in the mind of naturei dont think this can be properly interperted as a kind of panpsychism and that thinking is the process of paying attention to certain parts of the continuous development of the reality of thirdness represented in signs that semiotic reality is what i like to call the reality of living thirdness  does anyone know where this radical contextual substantivalism comes from im very interested in studying analytic metaphysics with peirceian semiotics    my blessed teachers thank you in advance for your wise words
  please stop mocking me i know you probably have better things to do but if yall would take the time to help me it would be much appreciated

some chapter 2 discussion from the previous thread    here the dialogue really takes off krishna begins his attempt to persuade arjuna to fight the battle which soon develops into a disscussion of selfcontrol and final liberation krishnas first line of reasoning is simple caste duty and honour arjuna should fight because he is a kshatriya and will lose all prestige if he refuses krishna soon gets more philosophical 213 is a famous summation of the hindu doctrine of reincarnation the embodied self passing from body to body in this chapter krishna explains that the true self is unchanging and eternal a reason why the wise man doesnt mourn for the dead advaita vedanta teachers like shankara identify this unchanging self with the monistic brahmanatman ramanuja identifies it with a theistic god whose body individual selves are part of however the sankyha philosophy that runs through the gita and is mentioned explicitly in 239 is all about ennumerating principles of reality hence 245 mentions the three constituents ie sattva rajas and tamas which can be very roughly translated as pure passionate darkinert these govern the evolutes of prakriti the origin of mental faculties senses and the material world in later sankhya philosophy prakriti is intrinsically distinct from the eternal self or person purusha making it incompatible with monist vedanta theories whether the gita is referring to this dualism of the later systematic sankhya school or the monism of the upanishads and later systematic vedanta school is a matter of serious debate        there are interesting views by the commentators on 212    bs miller translation  never have i not existed  nor you nor these kings  and never in the future  shall we cease to exist    ramanuja says that its saying the personal lord is being described as coeternal along with all the souls in existence this understanding is followed by rc zaehner an influential professor of religion active 19521974 this view accepts a multiplicity of selves though as part of the lord in some sense shankara says the seeming description of multiple selves as referring to the multiplicity of physical bodies meanwhile the absolute self is unchanging     radhakrishnan seems to attempt a synthesis of these views he says it indeed refers to the coeternality of the personal lord and individual sounds but goes on to describe the unchanging brahman self as being behind that apparent multiplicity he cites some very early evidence of the belief in empirical reality being part of the lord which ill quote here    white yajur veda samhita 3119a    radhakrishnan translation  the lord of the beings prajapati travels in the wombs though unborn he is born in many ways    wyv samhita 324    rth griffith translation  this very god pervadeth all the regions yea born aforetime in the womb he dwelleth  he verily born and to be born hereafter meeteth his offspring facing all directions

  a man is invited by his friends to a comic book convention at the last minute not wanting to go in plain clothes he throws together a costume out of discount halloween supplies and various nerd paraphernalia he has laying around   however shortly after they arrive a mysterious energy pulses through the convention center grounds that causes everyone to turn into what ever theyre dressed as and all cosplay items to function as if they where real the original quality of the cosplay or item determines how complete the transformation is because of this the mc becomes a bizarre composite being with a fraction of the powers of several fictional characters   the story would follow him and his friends trying to survive the chaosthe first night would devolve into a massive orgy thats only broken up by several con goers that turned into slasher villains by morning the dead would have risen again thanks to the several strains of zombie viruses leading to the surrounding city being put under martial law the government would try to intervene but would have to contend with a consul made up of nerds turned into lex luther darth vader captain picard dr who and professor x they would negotiate the formation of an independent city state in exchange for samples of advanced technology and the promise of not taking over the world with their legion of supermen it is during this time that the nerds find out that the farther they go from the convention center the more they begin to revert back to normal with the city limits being the point where their powers completely fade   many dont want the power fantasy to end but must find a place in the new geekopolis society others want to leave but cant due to the fictional science and magic keeping them alive after the first night dissipating if they go to far out      id aim for the ready player one/game of thrones crowd but id play up a lot of the body/psychological horror aspects of turning into a fictional character and slowly taking on their personality quirks

i like sun ra a lot space is cool as fuck you can just do whatever you want     mars is secretly inhabited by ancient aliens that are just crazy jazz musicians led by sun ra everything is egyptian and latin and latino themed and jazz powered the kennedys never got shot and we got out of nam and went to the moon and kept progressing technologically we were technologically in the 90s in the 70s a major character a wildly/scarily competent mexican/american girl based off my friend rachel is now leader of the world although our tech is very advanced we as humanity still shot our load too fast and our population and pollution are too high and she decides to send 1/4th of the population to mars damning everyone else to continue on the earths downward spiral past human survivability     the 1/4 make it to mars and as actual humans make it there as opposed to drones and rovers we break through the jazz cloak and discover the zany sun ra jazz culture to which the humans have a very hard time adapting to a ridiculous hitchhikers/pynchon fish out of water chapter or two     then sun ra and his arkestra snake off into space and his son a good looking arab type guy who i imagine as sacha baron cohen who has few lines and mostly just kubrick stares decides to invade earth the mars jazz egyptian/latin/latinos fuck earth up in 48 hours they land in japan and fuck every country and culture i care to mention up for 360 degrees there are goofy and funny military attempts to stop the jazz invaders but having lost a random 1/4 of the population the rest of earth lacks the structure to defend from the obnoxious jazz assault the son of sun ra will just make a big kubrick stare smile atop his giant mile wide attack pyramid and obnoxious jazz will fuck everyone up theyll fuck everyone up around the globe and transform it into a second jazz mars restoring the planet to a sustainable model for the jazz musicians and the humans that survive will learn jazz and become part of the great ensemble and life will continue as a 24 hour jazz party as the son of sun ra rides across the sky in his jazz pyramid     there will be elements of fitzgerald pynchon adams joyce tolstoy dostoevsky poe but most certainly not any fucking william faulkner fuck that motherfucker for making me relive my white trash american upbringing four fucking times also im trying to join the marine corps so im going to try to include war stuff too even just general military living pynchon and hemingway make me want military service before i write so some things may change
  hey man theres nothing there thats a line that doesnt meet itself in a circle or make a square and is left to ponder if the consequences were worth the cost i cant even understand if this is a coherent sentence to me how the shit could a black plague that isolates vast swaths of humanity be worth it i aint saying youre dumb or that this kind of plot doesnt take some good thought but how the shit is that gonna be an interesting story i think you pegged yourself with that feels derivative and preachy dont know if ill try to work that idea or ditch it youre not stupid and i want you to keep trying but i dont feel that line will take you anywhere not that im any expert just some drunk mofo on 4chan
  your second ending is much better human depravity is never surprising i read it in 7th grade and bevs dad wanted to suck her clit were on 4chan if you want to write books to surprise pedestrians you can but come on

  i like it would work well as a short or mediumlength story if you throw in a lot of cultural relativism and conflicting morality it seems like a phillip k dick sort of story       again sounds pretty good i like the idea of an honest and nice guy slowly turning into an asshole because thats the only way he can manage the people around him while desperately chasing a dream that is always just out of his reach a classic tale of rise and fall       nice i like it as the other anon said feels like an edgar rice burroughs kind of thing definitely try write this      10/10 write it itll probably sell well but no idea if /lit/ will approve       /pol/ out of 10       if written well this could turn into a psychological horror or some kind of abstract work that stoners read to make themselves feel smart       sounds like a darker version of clerks in a good way       i like this idea sounds like the plot to a british comedy and i could definitely see it in my mind as such       if you havent watched true detective i suggest you do i was getting a lot of similar vibes with your story and the plot of season 1 it might help you develop the idea a little and also avoid too many similarities i like the second ending mindfuck endings to a story thats always sort of hinted to it can be quite entertaining but it depends on your skills as a writer       this reminds me a lot of a story ive been planning for a while dont worry too much about being derivative as long as you bring in plenty of your own ideas and maybe add a spin to an old trope no one will care too much postapocalypse worlds are always a fun setting       i dont know what the fuck is going on here but good luck to you
  so your idea is a genderreverse of the click     man i hope you can draw
  i like this reminds me of the green butchers where they accidentally kill someone and sell the meat to people then it sells really well so they just keep finding excuses to keep killing people

years ago i had ideas for a comfy space opera where a girl and her giant spider robot companion travel from travel to planet doing archaeology and finding out earth    the human character is advanced to the point of looking alien and she wears an apparatus to assist her movement and breathing since her muscles are atrophied    the imagery was cool but i had no real ideas for a plot
  actually amazing

an accomplished wellrespected halloffame actor debuts his first criminal drama/thriller movie as a director to his shock the movie is met with scorching criticism by 12 independent critics which angers him to an extreme extent soon someone starts killing the critics in a manner similar to the movie and the police suspect the director he is temporarily detained however the murders do not stop     cue cliffhanger
boomp
nah i lack creativity to actually write something worth of it
the setting is boston met in the early 2000s two main characters one man from a prestigious upper class family in beacon hill with connections to the police and military but who as a young boy starts getting groomed by a major irish gang the other a blue collar one from southie with irish gang connections but wants to escape they both join the police first one gets welcomed in to high detective positions for organized crime with open arms due to his family prestige but little does the police know is hes informing for his gang the other is alot more talented but forced to work in undercover for their crime connections both are investigating that major irish gang organization the main theme is they are both informants for the police vs gang as each side tries to catch/evade the other but then what happens when the informants become aware of eachothers presence and are charged with trying to rat eachother out by finding information about eachother from their respective inside positions the books going to be called the hawthorne hypothesis
  in the future thousands of distant earthlike planets are discovered along with reliable terraforming and hybernation technology the problem is faster than light travel is impossible so the journey to another planet could last centuries nevertheless many people are launched in stasis to colonize these planets because earth is overpopulated    soon after even more people launch themselves on ships that are not directly bound to a planet instead the ships ai is instructed to just float in space and keep the people in stasis for millennia if needed while the ship scans known planets to find out what kind of human societies developed on them before the launch the people who boarded the ship would set some parameters on what kind of society they want to live in they didnt want to be among the people who colonize an alien planet they just want to find an ideal society the ships ai is tasked in finding it for them over the centuries as it observes the planets developing    the story follows a group of people as they travel through time and space looking for what they think would be the perfect society its a parallel for the ongoing immigration crisis i guess
  not really a story but a description of contemporary society and life in the style of old travel memoirs like the travels of marco polo or those books written by arab geographers like ibn jubayr the narrator would be a fictional traveller from some faraway nation that never experienced a modern society before the purpose of the narrative is that it could give an easily understandable overview of 21th century life to future generations even if society is wastly different by that time    it would highlight very basic thing that we take for granted in a very basic language like how and why people work in a capitalist society the use of money what are the family structures and institutions of power how people get around what kind of clothes they wear etc
  sounds cool desu

  a little interesting any idea where youre going with it i feel like a more abstract puzzle would better than a rubiks cube which is basically just either you know how to solve it algorithmically or you dont but im curious what your purpose for the story might be
  im gonna level with you chief i clicked on this thread and the image came fully formed in to my head and i have no intention of writing it or ever thinking of it again i just wanted to fit in i am so sorry

i had this idea where the main character goes so far in the galaxy that he eventually ends in a completely different time than the one on earth billions of years apart    at some point he would come back on earth but it would have been billions of years since he left there would be nothing except dust and rocks he hides in a cavern and start thinking     he realizes that he cannot go home and after a long time thinking he takes a leap of faith as meteors start falling on earth and decide to go further in space eventually he reaches the end of the universe witnesses indescribable and divine phenomenons maybe he could witness the origin of good and evil itself or the concept of duality but manage to keep his lucidity by reminding himself of a woman back on earth a face he doesnt really know whether or not existed or if he simply made it up as a beacon of hope he is then reborn in the exact same life as a baby in a way he goes back home after fulfilling his duty      but i dont know why he travels in space and basically what happens before the ending

tfw i started writing a passive aggressive sentence or two about some students feedback calling a central character in my unfinished story derivative of frankenstein accidentally sent it i then found myself writing 4 emails trying to apologize explain to them not try and explain their criticism any more even though it probably wouldve been better to just leave it as is or not try to apologize so fucking hard since it was only passive aggressive any way and he probably couldve even read the tone that well  tfw i wrote all that immature selfconscious shit despite the fact that im trying to start a writing club  he didnt even hate everything i wrote just the central element that isnt even halfway finished  god fucking damn it im such a child now i have to wait to see if he emails me back  what the hell have i done
  when you see him in person tell him that you are a child and hell understand probably
disliked unsubscribed
  eh live and learn nobody cares that much
  heres how you were supposed to handle it  its derivative of frankenstein  so what  imagine what the drones these days would say about virgil or dantes work then imagine if virgil or dante actually listened to the creative writing course plebs  academic literati are the antithesis of genuine artists
  ah nothing you can do now  talking about philosophy with some people  mfw someone uses logical arguments to critique it like some autistic person would out of no where    why it wasnt formal it wasnt set philosophy it was general thoughts and feelings    i hate smugness
  yeah i mean thats the thing is what am i even supposed to do about derivative to me it seems like all that really means is this idea isnt finished yet
  but of course i shouldnt be expecting perfect feedback like that half these students still dont yet know what theyre even saying when giving feedback and its not always that easy    its just sad because theres a chance i lost some help with starting the club but whatever im not required to read any email he sends me after the fact any way

  its december 1st anon
  i went to school with you guys too didnt you do that in the bathroom and suck his dick there was a rumour you sucked his dick and were bitter about it    also he was gone on 2 weeks on vacation with his family to bronson misouri

  im from indiana and i went to the same high school as him one of my greatest memories was grabbing his dick in front of his crush exposing his tour de force  lmao he started ejaculating and didnt show up in school for 2 months

  t john green
  some authors are such fucking cancer that they shouldnt be allowed to be published their careers are predicated upon a flawed and pernicious system
i think im going to have nonconsensual sex with john green    yes in fact right this moment i have resolved to rape this man all of my faculties and resources are now going to be put into achieving this end the way this man controls the contortions of his face elicits a deep apeish urge within me to do extremely violent and sexual damage to him    if you think about it how is john green different from a woman they are equally timid equally frivolous equally acquiescent equally narcissistic equally upset by a combination of words or ideas that do not conform to the statusquo and no doubt mr green has sucked a penis toomaybe just a silicon one for now but nevertheless he has tried it has been struck with the same sort of ohimsosonaughty inclination that seizes all women at some point in their life and with the frenzied tomtom of feminine sexuality blaring in their head which is only ever empty and only ever filled when the image or implication of a penis can be grasped in external reality and just like such a woman has john green greedily taken hold of the dildo that he secretly keeps in his top drawer why disguise it further why wouldnt he be happy if someone were to discover his little perversion oh think of how oh so so naughty that would be and after taking the full 75 of rubber down his throat he is filled with such a thrill such that no expression of his masculine sexuality has ever come close to attaining    hmm indeed the lines between woman and john green continue to blur and my dick continues to rise raping him could be ethically and epistemologically justified both through utilitarian ethics and platonic teleology but i will not go into that here suffice to say that raping john green would be a net benefit for the world as such as material entity and conceptual ideal it would be a rape that would satisfy so many hearts so many minds and most importantly my own penis    i am decided john green will be raped within the month i will devote myself to finding out his residency his routines and i will plot and plan my moment of violation meticulously this is a very real goal i have set and i shall know neither rest nor mortal satisfaction until it has been attained
    hey guys i was at the same school you guys remember that time john got a retarded girl to blow him under the bleachers but he couldnt get it up then he got caught by the gym teacher and suspended for 2 weeks then the girls parents filed a restraining order on him good times boys good times

  authoritarianism low openness to experience
  12 gauge nigga
  thank you for your service
  define successful and if you refer to wealth and riches at all you have failed at life
  ummm sweeetie not indulging in the succulent pleasure of bullying due to moral inhibition represents a low openness to experience i think youll find bullying correlates with low agreeableness
  yeah he probably doesnt even go to church at sundays  what a failure
itt ressentiment
  well i mean definitely it would correlate negative with agreeableness and to a smaller extent with conscientiousness but i mentioned openness to experience because a bully usually bullies those who are eccentric crazy effeminate autistic ugly unpopular who dress in a weird way who are different in some way as if they were forces of uniformity of normalization bullies have an authoritarian personality a social dominance orientation they are less likely to empathize or to try to understand difference
can someone explain positivism to me   i know very little about it heres what i think i know    positivism makes the hidden obvious  although i may not be able to explain this correctly its purpose is to uncover hidden bits of information and use them to uncover other hidden bits of information solving a mathematical equation would be positivistic  it relies on sensory input and thats what creates an experience which then translates to knowledge so knowledge can only be created in the human mind  its antitheological because supernatural metaphysical cannot be experienced through sensory input  it must be verifiable / repeatable  its antirealistic because knowledge is created in the human mind    how much of the above is wrong im probably also missing at least a few characteristics of positivism  i also read somewhere that plato is considered a positivist but rather than making the hidden obvious i think he made the obvious dubious wouldnt that be more in line with poststructuralism    i have no idea what logical positivism would then be
was he fallible
nigger thread thread niggers would enjoy
  i guess because he was made a human according to christianity at least
  no      he was not made human he was incarnate in a human body there is a major difference there christ took on universal human nature while retaining his divine nature this means that christ had a divine nature and a human nature a divine will and a human will but not a divine and human personhood there is only 1 person of christ to say otherwise is nestorianism a heresy
  to say otherwise is nestorianism a heresy    oh no im heretical according to a bunch of boyfuckers
  boyfuckers   owo how do i join
  you can only be a heretic if you are a christian dummy
  no wonder ctholics arent heretics then
  im not a papist dummy
  how could he have two wills at the same time isnt that incoherent
  he would have needed to exist first
i wanna read the old testament new testament and the quran what are the best versions of each
  because nature neccessitates will by taking on human nature christ took on human will christs human will does not resist or oppose but rather submits to his divine and almighty will eastern theology doesnt try to fully explain and analyse the hypostatic union we see it rather as a mystery which was affirmed at the third council of constantinople      cringe and bluepilled      get the orthodox study bible for old and new testament it uses the septuagint as the basis for the old and new king james as the basis for the new the study quran which was translated and edited by seyyed hossein nasr is supposed to be a good translation but ive heard more conservative muslims critique it as being more or less ecumenical which isnt surprising as nasr is a perrenialist
      but not a divine and human personhood    jesus was not a person  fuck off and yeah jesus did have a human will and it did submit to his divine will but not without his personhood lamenting for it agony in the garden hello mcfly
  god bless you thank you

what about when he killed that fig tree
  a very interesting question which i have often wondered of we know from his own words that he was not the father and did not have all the fathers knowledge he says    matthew 2436  but of that day and hour no one knows not even the angels of heaven nor the son but the father alone    from his own mouth we see that he is not omniscient meaning allknowing he knows only the extent to which he knew not everything    the question we ask is whether his own words that he did say could themselves be wrong he was human wasnt he and was it not said that jesus grew in wisdom from the time he was a child and did he not suffer the same temptations as any man else the episode with the devil in the desert would be meaningless and he cried for lazaruss friends and family which is not in temperament a marker of infallibility but vulnerability for temperament though not knowledge lastly he cried out my god my god why have you abandoned me while on the cross was this legitimate did he truly feel abandoned by the father in that moment does this indicate they werent always in complete connection he did choose to pray frequently did he not making it seem as if he needed to maintain the relationship through his own effort    these together cause me to think that he was fallible whether he actually made any errors is another question i personally feel that mostall of his words came from a place of solid truth even if not perfect truth which only the father could embody jesus was a divine man and the man in him prevented him from being as perfect as a purely divine being could have been we imagine even that angels and other hosts of heaven may have been more divine than him at least while jesus was still in mortal form after his ascending to heaven perhaps not since hes now seated by the father
his fully human side was  but not his fully divine side
  i didnt say jesus was not a person i said he is 1 divine person rather than 2 persons one human and 1 divine this is how we can say that that the virgin mary is theotokos rather than christotokos the 1 person of christ was fully god who fully took on human nature and therefore human will but this didnt compromise the divinity of his person
          based dyerpilled orthodox    someone has read their maximus and councils
  jesus was a transgender black woman
    i know this is bait but here you go
  no
what are some genuinely good mysteries that dont make you say  i knew that from the beginning  theres no way i couldve found that out on my own

has anyone read this is it /lit/
ive read it its decent and good for what it is it would fit in with some of the nonmessaging science fiction and fantasy book shared on the board but it doesnt get into its own themes enough to be more than that    major respect for the author though who has been putting out two chapters a week for years on end hes been improving and has a phenomenal work ethic
money represents libidinal energy that is orgone labor power is a good manufactured in the human body from processed orgone energy libido is unsuitable for alienating labor so its sexuality and rage functions must be refined through the creation of internal capital to wit muscle armoring chronic muscular contractions which together possess the same function as the freudian ego the process of childrearing is an exploitation of a childs autonomic nervous system entailing their being conditioned to fear the natural spontaneity of thetical libido the pruning of all desirous avenues constitutes the dialectical formation of personality as described in character analysis 1934 the primary erotic drive is stultified inspiring a defensive rage which cannot be expressed either these oedipal events were mistaken by freud to be inherent to being human emotions being identical to orgonotic currents in the soma the establishment of chronic contractile postures becomes necessary for cultural living at the cost of authenticity and sexual gratification it is noteworthy that the orgone energy inside these contracted somatic regions is of a stagnant virtue and is considered deadly thus the sum of muscle armoring is a machinic apparatus consisting of arrested bodily flows whose purpose it is to distill crude libido through the subliminatory exhaustion of energy   however this results in a value paradox because crude libidos clinical value far outweighs the value of labor the central therapeutic mechanism of orgone therapy and its descendants is the accumulation of free volatile somatic libido via its release from armoring this being a terrifying and despised thing such that the psychosomatic character defenses are threatened causing the surfacing of unconscious content that it can then be integrated into the ego moreover the condition of armoring is expressed in production as the somatic flows are arrested and bound in muscle armoring so natural processes are arrested in the production of machines this takes the form of a feedback loop in that people despising somatic orgonity and the relative entropy of the unarmored body overorganize their environments to diminish the entropic tension on themselves they create corpuscular spaces in which they can avoid the reality of the natural world allowing relaxation however mechanical relaxation of the muscles liberates libidinal energy from contraction thus breaking a persons threshold of tolerance because it is despised by virtue of sexnegating cultures conditioning it inspires anxiety and must be resublimated the mechanism whereby this is done is oftentimes the creation of more laborsaving technologies leading to more corpuscling more relaxation resublimation and innovation ad infinitum as we have seen the acceleration of technology has created far more needs than it has fulfilled
therefore laboring is an unprofitable use of libido compared to its use as a solvent for muscle armoring and the resolution of mass neurosis   the toxic child rearing methods of historic cultures are the true bonds enslaving the laborer to capitalistic usury the bourgeoisie are differentiated from the laborer and considered together as a class because of a specific libidinal metabolism or sexeconomy common to their psychosomas relationship to the means of production acts as a modulator for the general massneurotic conditions also experienced by the laborer that is to say their power over the environment allows capitalists to externalize their psychic defenses via the ownership of machines which ultimately corpuscle them from natural reality to a greater extent than the laborer the more neurotic a capitalist is the more extensive and complete this reallocation of libidinal surplus is  in the sexually devastated social landscape of the historic period money signifies libidinal currents hence currency it is stamped with the visages of the hierarchically dominant hearkening back to the days when somatic rather than economic virility for men was the measure of attraction it also represents the libidinal energy of the social body which has coalesced in the structure of a single armored body wherein the body politics desire is repressed by the state armoring it is traded for labor power which is a defiled version of orgone energy however the accumulation of capital and money consumes time which could have been devoted to the resolution of neuroses and therefore assets are liabilities money is debt money and capital are mere representations of libido the first shall be last and the last shall be first its all gonna end soon bois read the bible please
    yes
  no because in your scenario people wouldnt produce anything but themselves
  i believe that people have a natural productive capacity which is separate from work as sublimation it and the function of natural sexuality are two poles on an axis which libido oscillates in between however when sexnegating cultural conventions disrupt natural sexuality and the ability of humans to selfregulate their libidinal metabolism it also disrupts this natural capacity to work this productive capacity is then divided in part it must provide the mechanical work manifested in the contraction of the striated muscles for the sake of armoring then it must provide mechanical and cognitive work to economic labor and other motor activity
were gonna get audited bros
  historic religious systems were originally intended to resolve the neuroses of adherents through the correction of sexeconomic disruptions disruptions were intuitively sensed by early clergymen but due to the priestclasss ensconcement in sexnegating culture and that cultures deleterious effects on their psychosexual development they have taken what are supposed to be spontaneous behavior exhibited by the unarmored genital character and perverted them into draconian axioms any aberrations from this behavior set which due to its instinctual nature was attributed to divine or natural forces was deemed sin but under the perceptioncorrupting effects of armoring the early priestclasses often confused instinct and sin and constructed lapsarian myths which although preserving the chronology in which a thetical nature becomes corrupted relegated all instinctual virtues to the category of corruption  therefore all sexual activity besides intercourse was deemed fornication or sodomy these things being pregenital fetishism this is just one instance of the pervasive notion that the commandments of the divine together are a distorted image of the genitality and orgastic potency that the historic condition precludes another insight comes from john the baptist when he is baptizing in the jordan and says make way for the lord make his paths straight he is referring to the sexeconomic pathways of orgonotic discharge in the armored human organism the fourphase functioning of the orgasm reflex are arrested at various phases by virtue of pregenital libidinal cathexes sin corresponds to the quantities of libidinal energy bound in stasis by muscle armoring and more importantly the actions which these characters take thus in the egyptian book of the dead the departed souls must have their hearts weighed against a feather on the scales of maat the weight of the heart is proportional to the unresolved sexual tension and psychological complexes at the time of death this is also i suspect the origin of karma wherein ones soul must reincarnate again to learn something be punished c  in christian theology jesus christ is said be a ransom for the sins of the world and is compared to the sacrificial passover lamb and the scapegoat the cross symbolizes the rigidity of lifenegating culture imposed on children by the church pharisees state romans and mob his passion thereon symbolizes the destruction of natural sexuality and the ossuary the condition of armored life the resurrection the resolution of neurosis and historic condition meditation on this subject could possibly have a partially therapeutic effect by allegorically describing repressed trauma and ones ideal redemption therefrom and this is somehow seen as an externalization of stagnant libido onto a messianic figure
  jesus also constantly used money as a metaphor for libidinal energy during his ministry and his comment about money caesar and god reveals that the wealth pursued in the world is contrary to the libidinal energy which is defiled in order to accumulate that wealth he admonishes us not to stack up earthly treasure where moth and rust corrupt   john the baptist also says to repent for the kingdom of god is at hand repentance though perverted by the clergy into selfflagellation and selfdebasing is the psychic and visceral introspection required to liberate libidinal energy bound in muscle armoring this process was intuitively implied by religious doctrine and liturgy in the form of meditation confession repentance  the auditing of scientology

what would plato think of evola
  he would probably wrestle him into the ground evola looked like a lanklet
  that would be very based of him
who cares  nigger
  i do and probably several others here
  he would call him a charlatan sophist bitch
    how do you think plato would do on the wwe could he hold his own against the undertaker
he wouldnt
  plato literally believed in reincarnation evola doesnt
why is /lit/ obsessed with this muppet
  evola believed in metaphysics
  but not in reincarnation
  not as bad considering when he lived  evola was a contemporary of heidegger
  would plato have his exact genetics from the past or would he be reincarnated as a wwe class human
  ariston of argos dubbed him platon meaning broad on account of his robust figure  he was supposed to be big already but i guess he would have to roid to be on the wwe so lets say same genetics but roided
      plato also hated democracy so he would probably like him

not only was jung a raving antisemite but despite his inane dabblings in mysticism he wrote one of the worst works on yoga of all time the psychology of kundalini yoga a tome in which a man with no sanskrit who hadnt read the vedas denounced ancient indian philosophy    ohnonono
based jung was counter semitic
  lmao is this fucking real
  what does being an antisemite have to do with the validity or content of his work  feels incredibly tacked on as it has nothing to do with his actual criticism of jungs writings on yoga  imagine if i said something like  not only did jung not like the colour blue but despite his inane dabbling in mysticism he wrote one of the worst works on yoga of all time  it has the exact same amount of content relevant to the discussion as saying hes an antisemite it seems to me that the person making this post holds the view the being a countersemite is perhaps the worst moral evil imaginable and thus invalidates anything they write or say somehow that seems very strange to me how and why would this be the case it really makes me think
  he denounced the nazi party though
  antisemite / nazi  just saying
  listen man you cant expect everyone to have a 120 iq it was thrown in to make dumb peoples brain go  antisemitism  bad  jung  antisemite   jung  bad  bad  stupid   jung  stupid  its teally not that hard man just imagine what you would think like if you were dumber becuase thats who they want to appeal to its like how people try to smear public officials and businessmen by calling them racist who gives a shit if they even are racist a racist ceo and congressman by themselves couldnt do anything much at all and while obviously it should be known if they are racist but its not like its a mortal sin to dislike arabs or niggers
  honestly does anyone still cling to the illusion that any people who have suffered the presence of jews in their lands has any liking of that accursed tribe

what the hell is meant to be the take away here  and then everything was utterly awful for everyone forever and they died the end  what the fuck tolkien this lay of beleriand reads like some kind of misery porn
  i will continue to shill for this book to be placed with the highest honors within the canon until the day i die it is a modern mythic poetic tragedy of the english tongue whose best contemporary can be found in the likes of beowulf or some of marlowes plays  i think the rest of tolkiens stuff is childs play save for a few other sections from the silmarillion but the children of hurin is a masterpiece a masterpiece
implying this wasnt his diariacal outlet from t he crushing vision of his legacy his life family and degression that was never meant tto be seen by anyone other than his eyes as his slowly decaying mind still and maybe more so continued to blur reality and fantasy as it ever did  i didnt read the book but i do think he was an insane person
  children of húrin is set after the silmarillion right
  i do think he was an insane person  and thats a good thing
  its pretty cool the fact that lotr the hobbit coh and the silmarillion exist in the same universe and yet theyre from different genres somehow
  to be honest i am not positive but i believe so it has been a very very long time since i went through the silmarillion but i thought there might have been a mention of it in there maybe i am confusing it with the the tale of beren and lúthien which is the another great accomplishment of tolkiens that rises to canonical level
  set during the silmarillion goes into this story but the book is a much more detailed dramatic version
  normalfags    this is you you disgust me
  those types of stories were extremely common in a way it goes back to achilles a moment of glory or a lifetime of dullness
  i would argue that the iliad has a very coherent theme thats almost parablelike theres a lesson or a take away there the children of hurin though it has a vacuousness in that regard which i feel in a way actually adds to its effect it deepens the tragedy by rendering it truly senseless
  i didnt know i was james franco couldve been worse
  a common thing these stories have is that the hero is being manipulated by higher powers when you look at most greek heroes youll realize very few of them got a bittersweet ending let alone a happy one heracles is pretty much the only real exception
  yes but at the same time they dont die in an absolute void of bitterest regret wellwith a few exceptions like turin achilles certainly doesnt anyway
  supposedly read book  cant even piece together a coherent sentence involving any of its contents  this is why i despite anyone who claims to like the silmarillion since 99 of the time they are just dilettante retards who cant appreciate it franko though the embarrassment that he is outright confuses characters and disparate events together
  jason theseus ajax
  despise  fuck well i guess everything i said is discredited now
  bellerophon and my boy sisyphus who did nothing wrong
i stopped readin tolkien as soon as i found out he was a libcuck
  thought people should just keep to their own and their selves  a libcuck  what he only ever described himself as a mild anarchist
  all i know is turin made terrible mistakes he had moments where he could have redeemed himself and he chose not to and the consequences were devastating
  ajax  fuck odysseus
  yeah well at least he didnt die a virgin which is more than can be said for me
  bang your sister hope it works out for you try not to kill your best friend while youre at it
   i know is turin made terrible mistakes he had moments where he could have redeemed himself and he chose not to and the consequences were devastating  its heavily implied that it was impossible for him to make those right or different choices because of morgoths influence ill give an example if you remember when he was young and in doriath turin asked to be able to take up arms in some fashion against angband and as a result joined beleg in the defense of the kingdom its outright stated that despite always being the foremost in deed and danger turin could not be killed by any foe because of the curse that was upon him and he would recovery from any poison or wound his doom repeatedly saved him for it had not yet reached the hour of its fruition christopher tolkiens description    the curse of such a being who can claim that the shadow of my purpose lies upon arda  the earth and all that is in it bends slowly and surely to my will is unlike the curses or  imprecations of beings of far less power morgoth is not invoking evil or calamity on  húrin and his children he is not calling on a higher power to be the agent for he  master of the fates of arda as he named himself to húrin intends to bring about the ruin  of his enemy by the force of his own gigantic will thus he designs the future of those  whom he hates and so he says to húrin upon all whom you love my thought shall  weigh as a cloud of doom and it shall bring them down into darkness and despair    this is why people tend to be so appalled with how tolkien treats turin when you realize the breadth and inescapability of his suffering hes revealed as this monstrously hapless figure  can i not can i not mablung cried túrin but why no for see i am blind did you  not know blind blind groping since childhood in a dark mist of morgoth
  yes he was basically condemned to end as he did since he was a small child to live only that all he should come to know goes awry and is lost to him so what is the reader meant to understand from all this be careful stepping out your door since its a 1000ft drop to the bottom because fuck you
  anime picture  im not reading your garbage opinion you subhuman get out of my thread
  tfw the pleb filter is working
  he wrote it just after ww1
  perseus  odysseus  aeneas  diomedes    a fair number of greek heroes get happy/peaceful endings
      its a retelling of the tale of kullervo from kalevala its just set in middleearth i think theres a more direct retelling or was it a translation by tolkien that is supposed to come out soon or maybe its already been published
  tale of kullervo by tolkien has already been released there is many differences between turin and kullervo children of hurin is not much a retelling but more a tale which has been heavily influenced by tale of kullervo there are various differences in characters and in events in their lives turin is quite identifiable guy who makes bad choices with devastating consequences where kullervo is just an edgy narcissist most notable familiarities between stories are that both characters fuck their sisters fuck everything up and kill themselves in same way
  maybe but the vast majority dont
  the lay of luthien is the best thing he ever wrote even if it was never completed
  no the tale of turin is part of the silmarillion although the stand alone novel gives a more detailed account the same with the beren and luthien and the fall of gondolin novels

was he right
ive never read about this book the title looks interesting whats it about and what message does he convey
  only mathematics for the sake of mathematics are worth pursuing applications are ugly and mundane  pure mathematics is comparable to art
  wow what a faggot
  he is right     yes of course it is not the fact that mathematics has applications that its so amazing mathematics is indeed a kind of poetry its beautiful because of what one can understand or discover its the infinite ladder of abstraction that matters
from what sources do we know what happens in the trojan war after the iliad the death of achilles and ajax for example the iliad concludes with the funeral of hector i read the iliad for the first time and some of what i was familiar with of the story wasnt even sung by homer was it all summed up in the odyssey or are there other poets dramatists or historians who have depicted the events    much appreciated
  read the epic cycle by ml west
  aeschylus is one
  im really more concerned with the ancient texts rather than secondaries and summaries
we know about this stuff through our secondary information on the full epic cycle covered in ml wests article but basically it comes down to mentions in diodorus siculus the library of apollodorus and the scholia from the venetus a manuscript aside from countless parenthetical references from just about everyone in antiquity
itt authors youre glad that you can read in the original language

  start with sickness unto death and the present age supplement sadler videos
was k autistic i heard something like that
  autism is a choice
  fear and trembling is a nice place to start i think or works of love either/or is subtle and even though the language itself isnt an issue for most of it there are many layers of possible meaning in it and you could walk away with a seriously misinformed view if you dont catch the signs his layers of pseudonyms and use of irony are in full force there
  read the bible first
  basically this fear and trembling and the present age are a good place to start watching sk courseras lecture on youtube is also quite helpful
auther schopenhauer praised the hindu classics especially the vedas and the upanishads emphasizing their superiority to aramaic monotheism so ive decided to give them a read    i picked up a copy of the collected hindu scriptures but im having a hard time appreciating it most likely due to the language and cultural differences    does anyone know a decent commentary for a brainlet like me

  corrupt  i mean lets not ignore that she was a naive bitch who let it happen

  what happened to her isnt very important  its whats happening in the minds of the men who watch these videos
people on this board are so vain that they posture over books they pretend to have read anonymously thats right they are trying to signal social standing with posts that can never be connected to any other one they post or them as a personthe only person they could possibly be posturing to is themselves every single thread on a book will include a greentext of the book name attached with a disgusted looking harold bloom who they of course havent read thats how people argue here they just post a smug ohh i cant believe youd read something like that or snicker you actually think that with no context im convinced that no one has actually read a book on this board theyve just memorized names and faces and vague ideas associated with them and just bounce the same baseless conceptions back and forth between each other until it forms a board wide gestalt consciousness of pseud like someone here could show you the most obscure portrait of kant looking like a negrogoblin a wacky anecdote about coffee or his masturbation habits but ask them anything about his actual philosophy and you will get total silence ask about an entrylevel book total silence ask about a basic grammar concept total silence ask which author had the biggest forehead 100 replies with the most bitter arguments imaginable how anybody could think this place the last bastion of literary culture is unimaginable this board is the theoretical zeropoint of intelligent discussion on the internet
  maybe those men should get jobs and real goals
  having a job and real goals wont undo the effects of pornography addiction many wagies suffer from porn addiction too
  many wagies suffer from porn addiction too  most wagies dont have goals thats why they suffer from that
  name a goal that would help combat porn addiction that isnt abstinence
  you should take a minute to reflect on your response to even need one named for you means youre deeply nihilistic in reality any goal that really meant something to you would combat your addictions how about a basic one like marrying a gorgeous woman obtaining a job you love or at least dont mind and buying a beautiful house to raise a family in or something more relevant to this board like actually becoming well read and reading five hundred new works of classic literature you havent read yet in 2019

baron evolas commentaries are unironically good    t not a fascist
  please provide a list of every single white male involved in the production directing acting and distribution of porn please
  please provide a source on that quote
    indeed   i think porn combined with masturbation is bad and should be dropped regardless but when i had things happening in my life i would masturbate to porn maybe once every two weeks sometimes once a month i had no particular inclination towards it later however i struggled to stop doing the daily fap you decide to fap when you have nothing better to do which can then escalate into addiction embroiled in enriching hobbies masturbation is an afterthought enjoyed on irregular occasion
  white male  meaningless notion there is nothing that binds this random grouping jews on the other hand are clearly a strict ethnic group that engages in extensive nepotism and group strategies
  there is nothing that binds this random grouping  so then why do you promote white nationalism
  implying i didnt already acieved that while furiously masturbating to massive fake boobs
  guess you have nothing to worry about then especially not combating addiction
    please clap
  clap clap
  for the upanishads radhakrishnans commentary is excellent he refers to the classical commentaries rest of the vedas and later scriptures as well as drawing parallels with western philosophy its academic but still reasonably accessible he has a vedānta bias but the most influential commentaries came from the vedānta school after all    adi shankaras commentary is the most important and earliest surviving one there is a translation of his commentary on the brihadāranyaka upanishad by swamu madhavananda and translations of his other upanishad commentaries by swami gambhirananda    there is also patrick olivelles translation published by oxford which has copious end notes that are essentially a brief commentary it also has a very good introduction
  hindu scriptures  they have something to do with the occult groups they were larping in those times fact is most asian works are carp just focus on greek and roman works

how bad was the show ruined by feminism 
    
i havent read the books but zombie clegane is the biggest stupidity in the show that and the fact the actor was changed 3 times
  yeah dude thats why consuming this nergoisie shit is a waste of time in addition to the fact that it has near 0 literary merit and you only live once    if youre going to read scifi/fantasy stick to the literary ones feminists will never ruin botns because that book literally cant be adapted to the screen
  that wont stop them from writing some shlock and putting wolfes names on their shallow political inserts    unless hes got enough integrity to not sell out but even then i suspect itll likely be a choice for heirs and copyright heirs are notoriously awful people
  caring about shit shows based on shit books made to entertain the teen masses and the pleb  why go nutts over something like this
is it wrong to write things you fundamentally disagree just to please a professor
  its not wrong just gay as hell
  its how i got through my bachelors program basically praising leftist ideas in school for good grades and then go home to shitpost on /pol/
i did it all the time when i was an undergraduate your main goal during your uni years is to have a 37 gpa so you can apply to better grad schools when youre done
  i can only do it while drunk like rn i dont even overtly cuck out i just get so disgusted with myself for pretending that this stuff is worth even objective writing
no any kantorek who says otherwise is shitstirrer with nothing to lose
i should add that this is for a professor who thinks that jefferson plagiarized the constitution which he did not write from the iroquois and that english colonists regularly practiced cannibalism also anti vaxxer
ive done it and felt like shit ive also deliberately not done it of course the professors ive done it for have met with me privately offered to publish my writing and think im super brilliant its horrible

wtf i read this book it was a romance between a girl who pissed herself while skiing and some dude cant remember anything about him or the book for that matter apart from the girl pissing herself
  you know there are ways to learn math that arent textbooks    that the whole textbook thing is for being sucking the dick of academia not the people who actually want to learn more about math and/or science
when if ever will americans get back into literature has literature been doomed by technology
  americans are at the forefront of contemporary literature if youd spend some time reading youd know it
  but i do read
  i kind of misread your op anyway and yes less people are reading because they spend more time online it is a new activity and it is taking up a lot of attention
  americans are at the forefront of contemporary literature  no wonder its so bad if were at the forefront of it
  name a few contemporary writers that you have actually read give it a chance its good well it is if youre at least open to writers like pynchon or dfw or truman capote etc because a lot of it follows those and also confessionalists like larkin or plath
what are some famous/wellknown stories about breaking tradition/thinking outside the box

  this some of the happiest times of my life i was running 25 miles a week      the bible god is good god made the world and it is good god made adam who sinned and caught us all in a hereditary original sin this is a book that espouses reconciliation with god by faith and sowing and harvesting the fruits of the holy spirit literally will turn your life around if you dont have faith pray for some between prayer read philosophy until you find proof to grow your faith
  dont listen to the religion is the only way people fuck their childish notion the feelings are more important than truth hume put them to rest years ago but the soil of stupidity keeps growing them back
  that bow and arrow pic    near occasion
  id love to read your diary owo totally not creepy
  amen
  your words are garbage and your shits all retarded hume was a brainlet like kant unable to consider that the unknowable could exist existential crises like ops are not going to be cured by kneechee or whatever you would have said if your post had any useful content in it to begin with it is well known that god is the sole satisfier of man look it up

  your mind is sadly occluded with emotional biases  i will pray for the day when you reconsider such weak notions
this unironically
can gravity and love be considered gross and subtle versions of the same thing
no what kind of retarded question is this
of course technically everything is gravity
  weakest fundamental force  gravity is the incel of the universe
  if by that you mean that love is created by chemical substances which in addition to other factors also deal with gravity than yeah sure
reminder gravity is a meme representing the demiurge
gravity is just a visual distortion that causes the earth to appear round when its actually flat
  virgin gravity vs chad black hole
gravity is a lie created by the jews to make you think that you will not fall off the edge of the earth when you reach it wake up faggot the earth is flat the zionists have made you think its round ffs some of you people really cant be saved

is kenneth westphal a nonmetaphysical hegelian i always mix him up with merold westphal
  dont know but his reading is so lucid i would be surprised if it was
400 threads asking for an explanation on hegel  could have just read westphal    lazy
when he was finished he sat down on the bank with his side to the pool so that he could watch the trails entrance he embraced his knees and laid his chin down on his knees
pa walked around the truck looking at it and then he squatted down in the dust and found a stick to draw with one foot was flat to the ground the other rested on the ball and slightly back so that one knee was higher than the other left forearm rested on the lower left knee the right elbow on the right knee and the right fist cupped for the chin pa squatted there looking at the truck his chin in his cupped fist and uncle john moved toward him and squatted down beside him their eyes were brooding grampa came out of the house and saw the two squatting together and he jerked over and sat on the running board of the truck facing them that was the nucleus tom and connie and noah strolled in and squatted and the line was a halfcircle with grampa in the opening and then ma came out of the house and granma with her and rose of sharon behind walking daintily they took their places behind the squatting men they stood up and put their hands on their hips and the children ruthie and winfield hopped from foot to foot beside the women the children squidged their toes in the red dust but they made no sound only the preacher was not there he out of delicacy was sitting on the ground behind the house he was a good preacher and knew his people
what literary genre i dont like that word is this  i like this text a lot but i dont know how to describe it  when i write i cant write neither fiction or poetry or anything else i just ramble but not in diary form this text reminds me a little to the type of texts i do im not comparing myself with borges of course im just using it like an example because i cant find anything similar except ramblings we find in novels or short stories from time to time  i dont think it is necessary to put a tag or genre to everything tho  sorry for it being in spanish but i dont have a translation but i guess the translation must be easy to find  im pretty sure there are more english speakers readers of borges than spanish ones a lot of people dislike his love for english and european culture and society in general
  thats just a short story    you can look up them in anthologies of writers where they make a book made up of several such short stories
  genre i dont like that word  cringe
the difference between this text and mine is that even if both are self centred borges does it in a nice way with calm my stuff is just really neurotic usally talking about writing and why is it such nonsense and makes me insecure it really doest have any value is just teenage nihilism but i try to write it the best i can and making somehow funny at least
  looks like its in spanish bro thats probably why you cant understand it
  novel/poetry/essay/short story have kind of melted together in contemporary stuff i cant say ulysses is a nivel without feeling im lying because by novel must people will imagine something like the red and the black or crime and punishment   maybe im confusing genre with format sorry if thats the case  but for example borges sometimes writes experimental novels in literary criticism or review or essay format
  spanish is my native language thats why my editions are in spanish funny guy  borges style makes spanish feel like english he is like the complete opposite of garcía marquez cant belive that hack got the novel instead of borges
  novel  most  sorry
  hablando mierda de cien años de soledad  kek argentine would never do something as amazing as 100 years of solitude never    jealous argenmierdas
  but its not a regular short story right we can tell it is weird and it is borges but why could you describe or explain the difference between a normal short story and this type i dont know anything about literary theory so my opinions on this would probably end up being really poor
  you need to read more borges was simply about experimental stuff and this is a short story simply is a more post modern experimental stuff    a short story can be about anything in this case his relationships with himself    in any case if you wanna read more like this you can google writers that are borges wannabes or something
  marquez is childish escapism and small talk material for less than 105 iq undergrad girls or sleep aid for 50 y/o single moms
  meant to reply to 
  
        
  that is an essay more than a story borges made many essays short stories and poems op
  based
    who was in the wrong here
  genres are not tags and they are necessary in so far as they show us what type of text we are dealing with what to expect of it and how to read it the very fact that you are asking how to describe it means that genres are important to think about so stop being insecure about them it should be noted that genres are not fixed but everchanging and most of the time they mix with each other that text from borges and others is a good example of this you may call it a short story but it also could be read as a lyric essay perhaps you should read more about literary genres first
bump
  gabriela mistral got the nobel instead of borges garcía márquez totally deserved it
3 copies of the subtle art of not giving a fck please    oh yeah keep the change
do you take notes or underline while reading books i dont
  and i do
when i only underline i have the pleasure of rereading passages and saying this mustve been relevant in some way or another back then good to know  and i gloss over it
  while reading nonfiction yes
  i am extra careful not to leave even a smudge or fingerprint and not to bend the spine too much notes and any markings are simply out of the question
  depends sometimes i make notes on seperate index cards
  some history book but not super detailed more general lines that help me remember what i read
i used to never but now that i read digital more than physical i make quite a lot of notes probably most often for when another thing or specific piece of writing is mentioned and i want to read up on it    second hand books with occasional things in the margin or underlines are charming
  no never that would feel like studying
i dont even take notes while studying seems pretty pointless to me when you can just skim through again and memory does the rest of the work
if you dont get it leave immediately the board would be better without you
where do i start with girard
if youre only going to read one read things hidden    otherwise violence and the sacred the scapegoat btte desire deceit  the novel girard reader et al are all good    cant miss with the don
what girard books do i need to read to understand girardfag
im interested in compiling as pound attempted to in his abc a minimalists guide to english literature     i think this is the correct course because as we all know studying less broadly and more deeply is far more rewarding than breadth lacking depth     pound suggested  and i mean really suggested  chaucer then a gradual move into shakespeare gavin douglass aeneid goldings trans of ovid and marlowe    for my own part i would quibble with the douglas and the golding id chuck these for the king james bible and whatever translation of homer ovid vergil dante petrarch and the grimm fairy tales you likei dont think being a translation stickler with these pays off since theyre all more or less impossible to translate you read these i argue for their content as an english speaker for your imagination not your tongue    so my list is more shakespeareinfluenced i think pound overestimates goldings influence on shakespeare i think shakespeare was chaucer  kjv  immortal genius    thoughts      pic not related
    i think shakespeare was chaucer  kjv  immortal genius  and also plutarchs lives    petrarch  i meant plutarch

when should i start writing seriously ive always felt like i should read the as much of the greats as possible before i start really writing im now in my final year of college and while i know my style is pretty promising i still feel like i dont have the worldly experience to translate it into stories worth reading      any suggestions on when/how to get started
write now  and when you feel like it  and get to know the world too
please tell me the most recently published novel that youve enjoyed

bombs away by harry turtledove came out in 2015 or 2016
  /lit/ memes  why theyre good books
  didnt you know you can dismiss a work of art by simply calling it a meme fuck analysis fuck critique

how are you even supposed to read a paperback this thick
hes never watched blacked
thats why you buy a two volume hardback edition
  with your hands you whimp
  very carefully try tweezers
  okay but how do i deal with the enormous gutter loss its like trying to read a book printed on two halves of a watermelon side by side
  he didnt buy a first edtion hard cover  
handlets
    he didnt read victor hugs handwritten manuscripts
  never read a book that has been made into a musical
  use your hands dope literally rotate the book so the page you are reading faces you and is visible in full i read that same printing signet or whatever it was its a brick just deal with it as a consequence of your cheapness
  your loss
   never read one of the greatest gifts to literature just because some capitalist in the 80s thought itd be a good idea to add some songs to it
  everyone that isnt a financially impotent neet is an evil capitalist
  are people who write musicals capitalists then especially if theyre musicals based on already renowned works in the public domain im not saying its a bad thing but its definitely something a capitalist would do
just fold the fucking spine bro
  tfw no brothers karamazov musical  who murdered father would be the showstopper

  solar flare happens  how are you going to read when it destroy your ereader
  you are supposed to throw it in the paper recycling bin after reading
  how are you going to prepare for day x  kek honestly i was just bantering of course paperbooks are pleasant to hold i dont even own an ereader but i think itd be nice to have since i have thousands of pdfs on my computer  which one would you reccomend
you spilt it in half most paperback can be bent over backwards and then you easily split them in half
just tear out the pages as you go so it gets thinner
step up senpai
  i actually prefer ereaders to physical now and the biggest reason is simply how easy it is to hold an ereader if youre reading something nonfiction where you may be flipping back and forth repeatedly physical is obviously better but nobody will convince me in a hundred years that the average book is better to hold than a device that weights a third of a pound roughly and can turn a page on a single tap
      tfw kindle masterrace
like the trash romance novel it is
just hollow out the book and glue all the pages together then put a kindle in it so it looks like youre reading it on the train
  thats a old ass kindle you poor
  try for small amounts like twenty pages per sitting
  how did the spines survive
  i have the same edition of war and peace and a later 80s penguin les mis which is still in the small size the trick is not being a gibbon and holding your books correctly
not buying 100 year old leather bound editions of books exclusively
in public in a cafe because your gay
  spotted the millenial
  thank god for everymans library
    not every book we want can even be found as leather bound i do only buy hardbacks as i want them to last
  fpbp
  hold it with your feet up the your face then just smell the words
  dubs checked     one page at a time
  i read that exact edition and i never had any problems holding it do you even lift bro
  i exclusively read books that have been turned into musicals
  everymans library is for chads look really nice with the dust covers off
  with your large and powerful manly hands
  my last roommate had a paperback from his undergrad days containing no bullshit around 5 separate works by st augustine  its hard to tell the scale of the picture but im pretty sure it was thicker than that he said to read it you have to put other books underneath the sagging side and not care about fucking up the spine
cringe    to me it is the most indicative sign of cowardly dna

  all of that is fine except problematic you are associating it with people who have bad arguments the actual word itself is extremely tactful

  reply to this  post  or your mother  could die in her sleep tonight
  the _____er it is the ______er it is    i hate this fucking sentence structure so much its like the shrieks of demons in my ears some examples    the faster you go the quicker you get there    the prettier she is the uglier the soul     the gayer we are the higher the jizzum    the slower we eat the longer well shit    the fast we walk the quicker well get there     the dumber it is the funnier it sounds      fuck this and fuck everyone whos ever written a sentence like this in a book and anyone whos ever used this in dialogue it is abhorrent and it enrages me
pretentious  i get that some things try too hard but i often see this word as empty criticism would you prefer your media too smart or too dumb just because someone put a modicum of effort into creating something does that mean they should be derided and ignored buuuullshit
  all of that is fine
  based autistic anon i love when people have individual paintorment triggers that are total and insgodidahle for them but invisible to others cosmic isolation
  what was that word even supposed to be lol     i really do hate this sentence it drips with this condescending wisdom that isnt fucking real just because you boil something down to a causeandeffect that are obviously related but implied to be only tangentially so if even at all doesnt mean youre fucking smart just look at the smug shitchewing smirk of any retard who says this phrase and marvel in their bloated and hollow ego as they act as if they just bestowed upon you a great gift of sage advice thats easy to remember and formulaic but in reality theyre just shitting a reductionist slimy literary turd into your cupped and outstretched hands its absolutely baffling that these people can even live with themselves
  how could you show that no time has passed as efficiently as writing suddenly what is problematic is not the word but perhaps the over usage is instantly more preferable

  no one buckles at being called cringe if someone does something that is cringe inducing to todays standards it is probably a person who is brazen fearless or lacks social awareness all of those individuals could give less of a fuck if you said it but it does provide evidence that you are a spineless cunt and witnessed one of your greatest fears usually involving social suicide cringing used to be reserved for those who tremble at the sight of grotesque macabre humiliating society we have become
  i will man
  i use folks whats wrong with that ffs      penis of choice
  folks is used by the woke crowd in some misguided attempt to sound down to earth or something

  raging against a basic grammatical structure that helps us express correlation    im trying to decide between oof and yikes on this one
  obviously you see suddenly used to try to evoke a surprise or an twist to the reader suddenly x happened one might prefer to use the writing of the entire situation itself to create suddenness or quick events  i see too often in poor writers the lack of awareness that structure within your sentences can give as much feeling as words
  improper emphasis when writing on social media or informal writing     by this i mean when people choose to emphasize the word by placing it in all caps but do so on the wrong word often i can figure out which they actually mean through context clues but the fact that they cant see it frustrates the hell out of me    for example ill copy the last sentence i just wrote and adjust it as someone im speaking about would write it often i can figure out which they actually mean through context clues but the fact that they cant see it frustrates the hell out of me
  can you give a good example

  cringe and based are dumb memes recently revived by redditors seeking to install a system of upvotes and downvotes on our humble 4channel website
   raging against a basic grammatical structure  maybe he sees it as weird because its almost a non sequitur when you compare to similar structures in romance languages for instance
most substitutes for said shouted and whispered are fine since they describe the volume though said loudly and said quietly also work but others drive me up the wall with how lazy they are  hissed  breathed  snarled  screamed  barked  bellowed  snapped  insisted  explained  wondered  apologized  teased  continued  insisted  comforted  cautioned this one is one of the worst since it renders whats said meaningless might as well just write bob cautioned mary rather than watch out for the dogs bob cautioned fucking useless
  people are lazy for finding substitutes   instead of using stock words  how does that make sense its more work
  because as opposed to expressing the emotion purely through what the character says they rely on the dialogue describer to do all the work
  pies or cake
  lazy is an inaccurate word in this context its nullifying and inefficient perhaps
thank you op i agree its a way of harnessing socially reserved disgusting without justifying it or even giving the slightest bit of ones own evidence or a right to have their disgust matter you can call anything cringe as long as the crowds sense of entitlement to discrimination is on your side on a different board saying something perfectly tasteful and reasonable might be cringe here having poor diction or inarticulate style would be cringe but of course not on /tv/ its extremely petty and comes from a place of weakness exhaustion maybe based is similar but doesnt suffer nearly as much since it has retained most of its irony despite the postironic sublimation of the associated feeling eclipsing the initial cheery absurdity of calling stupid but interesting or righteous things based       you should both kill yourselves    rootless people use it to pretend they have a connection with those theyre talking down to and signaling towards its done to mimic the way that black people evince a volkish disposition towards one another when trying to steal from whites or get away with crime its only legitimate coming from rural plebs situated in their ancestral homeland addressed towards others who are genetically close to them and grew up around them     pedophile of chan

  glad im not the only one my guy is equally infuriating
    lmao you guys need to chill
  eloquent as ever mr dubs i couldnt agree more    i use it as a way to filter resilience levels those who naturally wouldnt use that sort of language usually are born leaders or dignified independent thinkers with an imagination in my experience its just so revealing of a crippled society that specific social situations or boundaries cause you to quiver to be ashamed is one thing it has a moral undertone to be overcome by fear is another
  like retards today will ise it like this    i have a different perspective than you    cringe     imagine how far weve come

this is a fantastic book that has helped me win friends and influence people not sure why it is so hated here
  yet here you are
because its for losers
  hey i dont know you but i bet we have a lot in common youre probably a great person i just want to share with everyone that this book has changed my life and helped me win friends and influence people
  chin up champ
ruined by his obsession with american presidents boring
nothing in it works    your fucked unless you are the fed and can prin money and have natural advantages looks height etc
warm handshake works but not sure if it is mentioned in this book
  liked it even if i had to skip some parts
you could read the contents and get everything this book contains his anecdotes are stupid and pointless like an old man rambling on about some stupid shit nobody cares about
it wears off for me though i find it hard to become interested in others lives and ask questions that i find engaging    its great advice though anyone who wants to improve their social skills should read it
hello /lit/ brainlet here  i just started reading smiths wealth of nations and i dont fucking understand a lot of the words how do i make my knowledge of old english better just read any suggestions
adam smith  old english  anon i
get a version adapted for modern audiences
  i said i was a brainlet nigga
  old english can only be interpreted as a compound and not as an adjective phrase  my favourite episode
  how funny
  the distinction is made by whether old is capitalized
  you think this is a motherfucking joke
  spotted a hottie  now thats literature
  go read marx
  i will but later

  most writers learn by experience but never could explain how and why and how their style works  the ends justify the means
ill take someone whos genuinely intelligent with nuanced insights over some book worm trying to apply his theory probably written by someone who hasnt written anything of value    in theory there is no difference between theory and practice in practice there is  yogi berra

read nothing from the past one hundred years eat no fruits from the past one thousand years drink nothing from the past four thousand years just wine and water but talk to no ordinary man over forty a man without a heroic bent starts dying at the age of thirty
  okay i wont buy any of your books then
  eat no fruits from the past one thousand years    the fuck
i want to believe that this guy isnt this much of a nut to have said this seriously but having read his books i just know that he did
  this guy fucks
  can someone explain to me what he is saying in that tweet i dont get it
  not doing your fucking homework pick your pieces up and throw your self down again
  okay i still dont get it
  this  i think that rules outlike a few species of citrus
  young people invent lots of things but usually those inventions dont work
  and beer is older than wine btw  cider is oldest of all readily occurring naturally
  dont stay up to date in any fields advances  its cool to eat rocks but not fruit since only fossils of older fruits are left after 1000 years  dont drink anything except partially boiled saltwater and goat or cow milk wine has only been known to exist for less than 4000 years whereas beer is thought to predate the sumerians 7500 years or more  dont ever learn why hitler was a bad person or why war is bad mmkay most soldiers who fought in the past 70100 years of war will not be 40 years old also fuck everyone who has mastered a craft or been in any kind of leadership position for any time if theyre past 40 theyre useless    ok fat man slay your dragons with that ham sandwich figure fitted into le honorable armor
  ooooh thanks friend i was misreading that
  a man without a heroic bent starts dying at the age of thirty  based
  yeah i also had to read it a couple of times first i was interpreting it as a if a then b clause
so if i started dying before i was 20 that would make me a goddamn superhero      eat no fruits from the past one thousand years  fruit domestication and then commercialization drastically increased the sugar content of all fruits the most saccharine were bred the rest were not grapes are a good example pure sugar beyond this fructose is the most dangerous of dietary saccharides  see  for an overview furthermore like lactose many people are allergic to fructose and do not even know it
  im old as shit must mean im heroic

im reading shakespeare for the first time since getting into literature 3 years ago and it is easily the best reading experience so far ive read the best works of other greats like joyce borges proust flaubert blake kafka and more     what can i do to get the most out of reading shakespeare i havent read any analyses seen any movies/plays based on his work im coming into him completely new i started with romeo  juliet and am loving it
  what can i do to get the most out of reading shakespeare  read it while walking around reciting in a pompous and altisonant voice
  no youre the fag
the problem with shakespeare is that he enthralls us less than exhausts us i guess thats the problem with us though
i only read greeks romans or germans no anglos french or even worse meds
  smart i hope you read them in the original language though otherwise youre a pseud and can get fucked
  hahahahaha look at this fucking pseud shakespeare isnt good at all at best it is something we all just tolerate because society still pretends its great literature that only smart people read but that time is already passing more and more people are admitting that there is nothing special about shakespeare and that youre not smart or deep for pretending to appreciate corny jokes from his time period
  this
  meh dante is better
  so are milton and chaucer still hes damn good
  have you read chaucer
  yes he is essential
  no op is a faggot
  you all are
  no
                              literally nothing to do with ops question you fucking faggots
  yikes
4chan is slowly turning into 9gag
  same op ive laughed and cried and had many gasps due to his unending wit and straight up fire dialogues from shakespeare more than any other author  also amazes me how little english has changed
  literature  plays arent literature
  julius caesar is book kino
what can i do to get the most out of reading shakespeare  my rec would be read academic articles about concepts which interest you and pertain to the play youre reading write in the margins underline if the book is yours and your god does not forbid these actions and make notes about your own observations in a dedicated pocket book would also suggest getting to know his background/moment in time elizabethan era etc and reading into his influences at least a little bit i think these strategies apply to any writer but with shakespeare youre pretty much guaranteed a big return on any investment you make
whats the best complete shakespeare edition to buy id prefer a multivolume set rather than one mammoth book was thinking of getting the norton one but its pretty expensive
  youre an idiot and nobody of value shares your retarded opinions
  i love these because it shows how fucking unperceptive and dense a lot of people are and makes me feel better for genuinely feeling and relating to greats
    i have an archive filled with copypastas about shakespeare on my office but im at home right now if this thread remaine alive i willpost them when i get back
    fucking pseuds this is exactly like the story where the emperor has no clothes but everyone pretends they can see a robe because they dont want people to think theyre stupid ironically the only smart person in that story is the kid who tells the truth 
  no u
  hurr durr im so fucking deep for pretending to care about some shitty old plays that arent even good   shakespeare is fucking pleb shit for tasteless faggots like you to pretend to have taste thats literally it
  this i have never met a selfprofessed shakespeare fan who wasnt stuck yo their own ass if you ask them why theyll answer vaguely about his wit or something they cant explain     i have more respect for people who admit they dont care for shakespeare than for people who just jump on this gay pseud bandwagon
be shakeys wife  your beloved husband dies  all he leaves you is his second best bed  wat do
  nap
  everyones just pretending to like what i dont like
wow what a miracle youre reading the guy everyone tells each other is the best in order to get pseud cred and like magic you like him a huge amount as well despite your tastes likely not being well correlated with other peoples youre definitely not just a pseud
  t would be contrarian  its funny how reversed things would be in a modern take on the emperors new clothes everyone thinking they have xray vision or something and the royal procession draped head to heel mummified in lead lined whatevers
reading shakespeare
  when you shit on shakespeare in a /lit/ board   yeah youre a genius
  i read a lot of shakespeare during a lit class i took in college and felt the same way as you hes brilliant id recommend looking up the historical context of each play before you read it to get an understanding of what was going on in shakespeares world at the time for example if i remember correctly the tempest was partly a critique of the political climate of the time period which could help give you some insight into the characters and their actions good luck on your shakespeare journey anon its a fun ride
  please do
  mate shakespeare is a god and i say that as someone who thinks not all of his plays are good
  i bet he smelled really good
  this sounds great thanks regarding reading into his influences i actually arrived at him this way i loved seneca then montaigne had a huge impact on my life ill expand more though he seems to pulls from many great minds worth examining
  imagine hugging william and touching his soft hair
how should i go about getting into shakespeare i read romeo and juliet othello and macbeth for school but i only started to actually enjoy his writing in my last year of school where i was doing macbeth and passages like the tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow one and the was the hope drunk wherein you dressed yourself one blew me away i want to reread those three as well as hamlet and king lear at least but if its better for me to watch them how should i go about that
    shakespeare isnt even that good the only reason he still has such a reputation is because hes usually babbys first literature thats isnt just new york times bestseller commercial garbage and often he is their last because they stop there and pretend that they have achieved literature enlightenment lmao     fucking pseuds shakespeare is entry level shit and honestly not that great compared to other more accomplished writers tldr you are plebs who fell for the pleb trap that is shakespeare
  this
every fucking shakes thread some butthurt nonanglo thirdworld language nigger has to tell us how shakes is overrated
  this desu if you think shakespeare is a god youre a fucking normie who just for the first time picked up a book that wasnt game of thrones or harry potter
this whole thread yikes   1000 years from now future pseuds are going to be reading scripts from seinfeld and holding larry david up to the same regard that current pseuds hold shakespeare
  im reading larry david for the first time since getting into literature 3 years ago and it is easily the best reading experience so far ive read the best works of other greats like big bang theory friends and more     what can i do to get the most out of reading larry david i havent read any analyses seen any movies/plays based on his work im coming into him completely new i started with curb your enthusiasm and am loving it

  best writer of all time  did you even read a single book besides harry potter
  anglo  youre a mutt barely even european
  shit guess that makes bloom nabakov milton joyce and johnson normies who didnt really read
  not reading shakespeare  chaucer  dostoevsky    you are doomed to eternal pseudery which is a shame because youre doing everything else right
  you can get the most out of the plays by actually watching them obviously  the globe has recordings of nonabridged performances on their website if thats what youre looking for
with shakespeare one doesnt need anything other than patience and insight while having a solid understanding of elizabethan history and politics certainly doesnt hurt in terms of understanding fully what shakespeare may have been saying it isnt necessary to appreciate the beauty of his drama any more than having a degree in art history is a prerequisite to enjoying say davinci patience is necessary for grasping elizabethan era english insight allows one to perceive shakespeares geniusthat which makes his work timeless i found kenneth branaughs films a particularly good introduction to shakespearean productions if you dont have access to a good live stage production good luck and enjoy
   im coming into him completely new    shakespeare has probably had boipussy before
  watching shakespeare

  he was a true genius im about to read othello for the first time now i may also watch some plays on the internet later

  the fact that you are like that does not mean that everyone also is there are plenty of examples throughout history where people put their convictions and beliefs beyond mere survival    i was also like that but then i changed my mind i think that it is good though that you are trying to live a virtuous life but eventually you grow out of it    gnostic ideals  can you elaborate on that it is very interesting
reason can only reside within a healthy human mind people on the verge of starvation can no longer reason so in effect they are no longer human but rather bestial forms viciously seeking return to the human realm

  went vegetarian because my partner was vegetarian  was a couple for about one year six years ago  im still vegetarian because im never got around to readjusting my cooking again  it does make it somewhat easier to get laid but the effect is basically countered by the fact that i dont really care about animal suffering climate change and all the other usual arguments

for a liberal particularly a neoliberal man is mutable no matter who he is what he is or where he came from he is wholly mutable his destiny and his personhood are clay shaped by the hands of himself and society this mutability is true of humanity as a whole and its civilizations everything is changeable all is in flux and with concerted effort and good will one can shape ones clay into something strong and beautiful and good    to be a true conservative one first must be an essentialist

is postmodernisms notion of the dialectical conflict between ideologically perceived historilogical idea of progress being a central constridiction of discourse and to abandon notions of progress as being completely universal itself a notion of progress as in such attempting to progress beyond the current frame of discourse so perhaps to attempt to progress past the notion of progression is itself a dialectical contradiction and error in knowledge
  how can one not see the process of rejecting a notion of historical progress itself its own progression towards new understanding its self defeating

  the politicized idea of progress is different than just change up to the 18th century progress was considered cyclical and individual now it is assumed to be linear perpetual uniform across all facets of life and always towards the better
  shit tier understanding of historiography desu senpai whigism has fallen out of favour and come back multiple times since the 18th century currently were in a whig phase in a few years we wont
  literally what is liberalism other than whiggism i challenge you to find me a spenglerian liberal
  waves on a continually increasing trend as the progressives would see it i bet the whigs of today have some different ideas than the whigs of the 18th century one might even say that the philosophy has progressed
  all of philosophy is semantics you pseud
dave cohen made me a determinist    
  this liberalism and the notion of natural rights human rights and so on are all very much predicated on being ends towards which we must progress          hmm i think maybe yall are conflating pessimism/optimism about an age with the acceptance/rejection of whigism whigism accepts that there will be hiccups on the road of progress you can be pessimistic about your current time while still being fundamentally a whig    example there is a growing pessimism concerning climate change and the current political trends but all these people still fundamentally believe in vague ideals towards which we are or should progress

he didnt exercise mercy and was therefore a hypocrite
  no one showed him any mercy he should have just accepted death after losing his daughter to a goyim they gave him a fate far worse than death i imagine he probably killed himself not long after the end of the play    thinks shakespeare isnt literature  not going to make it
  why should a contract be subject to mercy they entered into a fair agreement and shylock was well within his right to exercise the stipulations for default theres a reason they didnt take him to a real trial they had no legal leg to stand on

i read at my desk or in bed more so the latter right now because the tilt function on my desk chair has broken so its a nuisance
  womb chair looks retarded but its super comfortable you can probably try it out in a specialty furniture store if youre in a city
i like to read in a bruno mathson chair
  interested in this as well as /lit/ furniture in general

say i want to describe a guy turning around quickly and he is nude and his dick is flaccid but not long and loosehanging and i want to describe the flippityfloppity motion as he turns with some word other than swung which would imply hes hung like a horse what word what i use    serious question
what are synonymsjpg
describe the inaudible gurgling gasps of air escaping his smegmaridden foreskin

pendulate in british ˈpɛndjʊˌlejt verb intransitive to swing in the motion of a pendulum
  his pendulous member though flaccid pierced the vision of the morning commuters on the ltrain with its lazy quarter volutions as the esteemed elder continued his fanciful daydream of his days in okinawa sexually assaulting young indigenous coloreds though this brought an ancient feeling of sensual delight his calcified and atonic smooth muscles could not muster the heroism necessary to produce what would have been a rather impressive but in no way barbaric display of virility for the whole cars undoubted astonishment and enrichment
  really good answer i like that thanks      interesting answer i will have to look thatone up
  in his swift turning his penis petered out once more to a resting position as he stood resenting a position that was past resentment
  his penis nodded horizontally
  he whipped around to face them and his dangling dick whipped with him slapping his pelvis lightly before dangling down again
  slapping his hipbone lightly
he turned around his limp organ centrifuging and briefly pointing accusingly at all the onlookers

what was the point of this faggoty leafthrowing duel that wasted a good chunk of an otherwise decent novel
  not something for smooth brains like urself
  the fact that severian doesnt die at the end is what makes him realize the claw can bring people back to life and what sets him on the path to becoming future space jesus  the buildup to the fight is the weakest part of the book though
  hes not literally the sun however jesus and other redeeming gods tend to be sun gods see also mithras horus zeushelios etc
  people who dont understand key plot devices about this novel separate the low iq sci to nuts who read it and literally anybody else saying this series is difficult to read proves youre a moron still a fantastic series though
  the buildup to the fight is weakest part of the book  you mean the best part of the book botanical gardens was kino
  which literary works are botns close to in terms of difficulty or even better style i had a feeling that the ulysses of sci fi crap would just be from the perspective of genre fiction readers
  the fact that severian doesnt die at the end  severian unironically die several times during the story but is resurrected by aliums
  proust is an influence but mostly borges
  he does in the first 2 pages but underwater space demons wont ever let him die
  the scene where severian meets baldanders is lifted directly from mobydick
  should i read those books again
  id like to read over a couple parts again it kinda clicked after while a good deal of the details of the old world match what is happening to our society right now
  fuck proust fruity ass hole cant finish a damn sentence without embellishing it to foppery hell
  hes the goat
  escapist genre trash  
the sun is capital
  plagiarism is good now
  that really makes me not want to read them again lol

hello like the title says what are the most disturbing/unsettling books you have ever read i just finished pic related and it was just really disturbing
enlightenment now by stephen pinker
the chapo guide to revolution a manifesto against logic facts and reason  by chapo trap house
  creepy asf this one is mostly told from the pov of a random bystander who may be anything but unreliable narrator decent prose well done
  s phincter
  thanks for the rec
late beckett especially the three pieces collected in nohow on as well as stirrings still the last prose piece he ever completed
  never heard of this before whats it all about
  holy shit how do you even survive something like that from the yorkshire ripper her mates must be well shoddy if they ignored her after her attack
genius hack or neither why
  average thinker  copped out of making positive claims  made claims based on his own willful distortions of history  his whole philosophy is based on misunderstandings of nietzsche  wed be better off if he didnt exist
evil guy
wishful thinker and absolutely ideological
extremely brilliant probably a genius   have only read 100 pages or so of discipline and punish which was surprisingly readable though im sure i missed much     the idea of power existing in places like medicine and psychiatry is fascinating it seems to be a major idea of his that post enlightenment freethinking man was chartered for the convenience of power and its emancipatory posture is a veil man is a prisoner of this system not its beneficiary
  prisons  he stated the obvious
rehashed heidegger
  thats derrida but instead of being based and redpilled he was depressed and jewish  foucault is just aids nietzsche
op here just going to say that i have only read this is not a pipe and while i found it initially quite difficult once i parsed it i found the discussion of the hierarchical bond between objects and words interesting and the idea of severing that bond was one of the best ways ive ever heard the idea of postmodern episteme deconstruction put forward before i was mostly wondering if i should go on to his other stuff or just stop here
        guys please do not comment in the thread if your knowledge consists exclusively of hearsay this makes for bad board quality
  if it interests you why not  power is hard to define though and not the best metric to measure words
  guy please refute our claims before directing us to be quiet
  historicity of dasein and aletheia bro
  you cannot actually make claims about an author you have never studied yourself you can only make claims about things youve heard about them
    what is knowledge    shut the fuck up nigger
yo i was listening to the audiobook the fifties by david halberstam comfy level off the charts and it gave me a new appreciation for elvis i grew up with the hip hop generation where rappers constantly talked shit about elvis to the point he seemed similar if not worse than hitler but it turns out elvis was actually pretty fuckin rad for his time which is to say the early 50s
  he was a neo protofascist
  do you usually enable pedophiles or just foucault
  both
  genius
a genius unless youre obsessed with jbp
he was ok his work concerning prisons red pilled me on the prison system however i didnt like his criticisms of religion i feel that he was just bitter because he was gay and they didnt accept him
  he wears a turtleneck so hes obviously a fuckwit
gay homosexual sadomasochistic aids faggot  reverred by poststructural queertheory spewing feminists and antiracists    might as well read fanon if you wanna read useless shite

why didnt foucualt just deconstruct the power relations of the hiv colonising his rectum

  foucault addresses this
  murdock murdoch where hath thou gone
  more like cuckault
  ripped off angela davis without credit in his most popular work
  foucault was writing his most important works while davis was still getting blowbang bukkaked by the panthers fuck off
hes just a hack who took subjectivity for all its worth and incorporated that into a theory of power structures and prevailing opinions literally the philosophy of a precocious edgy teenthe only difference is that foucault is adored by lesbians and postmodernist loons
  yeah and hes gay
  pseudlevel ideology
  goddammit reddit
  this too filthy sodomite got what he deserved tbqh
yet another thread about a thinker containing not a single post demonstrating the most basic familiarity with their work    its just pointless completely pointless why do you carry on like this
  actually thats not reddit but old/lit/ back when people talked about booked besides stereotyped memes
  his ideas on authority and power were obviously absurd coming from the sadomasochist mind his ideas about history as an active force in contemporary society were genius    he was still a faggot
  who cares foucault was a homo
  why do you feel the need to have opinions on everything or to demonstrate familiarity with complex topics while posting anonymously    please take your googlesearch youtube wikipedia cereal brain and go to another board where the theme is not reading books
man this thread wouldnt know a book if it was covered in bbccum and shoved 26 centimetres up its ass    fuck you /pol/tard r/fag    fanon is worth a glance at least as much as badiou you fucking illiterate pseud learn how to read words your retard bias hasnt already given the retard stamp of approval
  what how intersectionality something or other
  angela davis is an old school marxist not an intersecionalityist to bad all her writing is bland boilerplate commie shit and her only real claim to fame is providing the gun for that dude who iced a judge so then again as a marxist i guess she did more than 99 of marxist professors ever will even if it was a futile gesture
  are you trying to accuse me of posturinganonymously you make about as much sense as foucault trying to feel a part of society after realizing all he wants to do is exert power over others because inside his heart he was absolutely powerless every leather jacket and turtleneck in the works wont change that
  booked elvis back in 89 newfag  book all the time hell r/bookfag ova heah  you dont even book newfag ive been on this bored reading bios of rockstars and presidential since 17  get on my level
  wrong  wrong wrong so wrong i hate you kys
  its not a bio faggot its putting elvis into his cultural context of the precivil rights south and yeah if elvis hadnt exist someone else would have been elvis but still elvis was elvis deal with it
  show me an intersectional statement from angela davis or are you a just faggot who watches jordan peterson youtubes
  someone hating on bataille give me a rundown on this book
  just leave go away stop ruining what was once a great board    better yet go read a book about foucault try reading the stanford encylopedia entry for him all of it learn something it will be fun and exciting
  naw dumbass elvis was what he was because he was who he was using what was available to be the most elvis he could be youre just a sniveling bitch
  read black feminist thought you motherfucking retard ive been reading davis since before you first thumbed your asshole and just because youre a pseud doesnt mean i give two fucks about all the cucks croaking on about muh liburrals rights and fingering foucault as the forebearer of their dead white suburban bitchboi advantages
  black feminist thought  book not even by angela davis published in 1990    foucault died in 1984 you utter brainlet
  so how much longer do you have as a teaching assistant until they throw you out into reality    are you trying to gatekeep the /lit/ board dont be mad at us all of this is simply the newest iteration of the world if you dont like this culture jamming blame saul alinsky and your fellow cabal of lefties    in the meantime enjoy your soi
  he bascially destroyed about 75 of poli sci by leading future lecturers into a hole that most of them cant think their way out of
    nevermind read the introduction good shit
  read the book including davis comments on the intersections of race and sex undergirding one of the most relevant frameworks for intersectionality  you fucking dumbass  still no indication of where foucault ripped off davis  is still a fucking retard  still hasnt read a single thing by either davis foucault collins or dorothy smith
  kek shut up you lil zoomer newfag /pol/tard newfag /r/tard hahaha seriously kill your 15 yr old self
  still no indication of where foucault ripped off davis    if youre such an angela davis expert why cant you point to a primary source that predates foucault moreover foucault didnt write about intersectionality
  absolutely buttmurdered
the hysteric asshole screeching about angela davis is exactly how i imagine anyone who has read anything by angela davis pottery
  pretty much     her whole thing is like  tee hee afros are cool white guys are like tooootally rude    she was just the protohipster nothing special
  she was overcompensating for being like 75 white like kapernick
  if youre such an angela davis expert why cant you point to a primary source that predates foucault moreover foucault didnt write about intersectionality  ding ding ding  hasnt given any actual sources to support original claim of foucault ripping off davis despite original claim holding burden of proof  factual progression of influence demonstrating both foucaults influence on davis but also his infulence on the doctrinal history behind intersectionality  pseudism
  we truly live in the era of fawkkk u daddy u cant tell me wut to do
  buttmurdered  pasttense of butthurt  butt  being 15
  angela davis was a card carrying member of the fucking mainstream orthodox stalinist cpusa that was directly controlled by soviet russia right up until the end of soviet communism she was a fucking boring generic marxist with a nice fro that is all
  your ex girlfriend is gonna be mad at you for being ageist be careful youre on thin ice
  stop posturing you ignorant fuck
  hes just mad that the same jocks that gave him swirlies in school are now cracking jokes at all the dumb philosophical books and ideas he took safe harbor in to emotionally cope just like foucault
  both
  imagine being such an insecure brainlet that you feel bullied by foucault lmao
  oh sweetie
  hes obviously baiting the other guy too probably
  you are a literal pseud if you think a black female feminist commie in the 60s was not advocating for an intersectional understanding of race class and sexbased oppression it fucking doesnt matter your opinion on intersectionality or feminism or foucault  this is just an undeniable fact and you have yet to actually show foucault ripping off such an easy person to point to for intersectionality as davis because you only understand foucault and davis and intersectionality from the retarded view of someone like jbp because you like peterson have never read any of it for yourself dumbass pseud
  ofcourse i am its why youre losing    i should thank the nuleft for gifting me absurdist comedy and the ability to make things truly subversive there was a lull in anything cultural there for a moment
  jesus i have no idea why i dont even give a fuck about foucault or davis or anything else but i have never hated anyone more for their wrongness than you in this moment right now excellent fucking bait you goddam pseud asshole
  foucault has nothing to do with intersectionality shut up  you have never even read him
  highly effective shitposter fuck you and your kind      worst kind of troll       fell for the bait
  nevermind read the introduction  where did you find it
be liberal degenerate faggot  make excuses for extremely reactionary theocracies  why
  have you even read maga mindset by mike cernovich
  he was a sub that liked to be domd he had a fetish for powerful people asserting their dominance over him thats why he wrote so much about power  he got sexual thrill out of it
  no why should i
    this it was all a sexual thing he was only considered left because at the time being transgressive was left wing
  maga mindset  fuck yeah dude u tryna pump it up a lil tryna take it nxt lvl swole tired of being a little book reading bitch ready to make america great again     mike cernovich
  you didnt answer my question also what does this have to do with foucault
  kek meme time  retired    make emerica maha eigen    retired again     mike sernofbitch
  your brain on chapo trap house
  by retreating to the margins of cultural difference and posing behind a stance of merely verbal harassment aimed at say phallocracy or televangelism the foucauldians do in fact renounce to antagonize in a united front the powers that be superficially what seems most contradictory of these foucauldians is their use of reason to humiliate reason and of rational language what they refer to as discourse to celebrate chaos more than a contradiction this is cheating georges bataille himself admitted the realm of thought he said is horror yes it is horror itself it is like slipping in the night on the pitch of a roof with no parapet and in a wind that nothing appeases the more thought is rigorous the more the menace intensifies
all knowledge is based on power therefore cant say anything relevant about objective truth  apart from the above claim itself obviously  hack
  who are you shouting at pseud
  /lit/erally this guy  is arguing with the retard saying foucault ripped off angela davis and the pseud saying angela davis has nothing to do with intersectionality because he only views like jbp cuckslave
  actually all power is based on knowledge
  what about gorillas those things are powerful but know nothing
  they know the process of actualizing peer advantages produced from deployment of physicalstrength action sets upon the field of their social reality
ehs a pretty based guy who wasnt afraid of getting us past the marx phase but also had no qualms about incorporating marxian concepts in his work
  it seems to be a major idea of his that post enlightenment freethinking man was chartered for the convenience of power and its emancipatory posture is a veil man is a prisoner of this system not its beneficiary  probably true but theres nothing wrong with power per se
  isnt this the guy that the anime fist of the north star is based on

  he ugly
  what hole would that be
  youre thinking of one punch man

how come milton made this character so relatable was he aware or is my view warped by modern values
  im glad you asked he made satan a fully actualized and brilliant version of who we all are when we do not actively combat our pride and submit to god
  he had a bit more freedom with satan   he could indulge his classical pagan allusions where he was a bit more constrained with god
  for the last fucking time once again  lucifer was meant to seem somewhat appealing in the beginning of paradise lost because he had just been cast out of heaven and therefore still bore much of that divine radiance along with the outstanding heavenly charisma that caused so many angels to rebel along with him he is enticing he is tragic he is still somewhat the greatest archangel  however as the poem progresses that radiant eminence fades and lucifers corruption becomes more and more complete his personality more and more earthly the realm which he is to rule and he develops into the hideous devil that humanity came to know him to be  so his character is a development from the vertex to the void  i guess people just dont get this because they only read the first fucking book or maybe the first three if theyre badass intellectuals
  ive read it to completion yeah i realize that i was mostly referring to his character at the start which is the part that usually leaves the greatest impression he was still enticing during the actual war in heaven though even though he was driven by jealousy he still felt believable and human
i also find incest relateable
  bet you havent even read paradise regained baka pleb
  for the final     father fucking time     say it louder
correction to my other thread on translations  its possible that i thought that the old english translation of genesis was a part of paradise lost  im sorry
  this it turns out its really hard to write the script of a transcendent allknowing being without sounding too narrow and rigid he did perhaps the best he could satan is an easy character to write because he is the embodiment of our basest sin pride of course we can relate to it because its the very sin at the heart of the fall of man
  he was of the devils party without knowing it

  thanks for the list though i hadnt seen it before
  not a problem if theres another chart youre looking for let me know i might have it    otherwise merry christmas anon

doesnt charles dickens have a place among this list
  youre a mong
  blood meridian doesnt even belong on that list
  but they are on   honestly the 2015/2016/2017 lists are really good probably the best top 100 books lists ive ever seen you may have issues with individual placements but the 100 books we have chosen are ten times better than those that any other sites would have chosen especially now that weve ironed out harry potter from the list i cant wait to see 2018s list  im just wondering how much stoner will rise its already top 10 if i had to make a complaint id say that there should be a list for novels a list for plays a list for poems a list for poetry collections a list for non fiction a list for short stories and either a list for short story collections or just keep them with the novels not all of them would necessarily have to be top 100 its just that at the moment these top 100s might as well just be top 100 novels with about 10 exceptions iliad odyssey hamlet divine comedy platos dialogues dubliners ficciones and maybe leaves of grass i havent looked for it yet i probably missed some though   also wheres gullivers travels
  but they are on   they are indeed somehow i didnt notice

is everything incliding art and literature political
  maybe but regardless of the truth that statement is still just a pathetic excuse used by mindless sociallyminded drones to not engage with deeper philosophies and schools of thought
  only if ur a moralistic murican
  is it possible to make art thats not inherently political
no
  fuck no if you think this you suffer from political brainrot
no unless you want to grasp the bottom of the barrel everything is however egoistical
a little
  everything can be political if you apply a friendenemy dichotomy to it in liberal democracy which is a total state everyone participates in the political and all categories of life partake to a degree in the political so literature will inevitably become politicised
  if you mean that some of the authors opinions regarding how their country should be run will sneak in then yes its almost impossible not to whether its overtly or intended to be political is another thing and again people can usually wring whatever readings they want to out of a work no matter what was intended
how boring
  the human condition is inherently political therefore every piece of art about humans is political however the modern understanding of politics is quite restrictive and the political elements of an artwork do not have to confirm to our partisans views about politics nor does politics have to be activelly adressed by every piece of art    there is a good quote in aristotle politics about man an politics       man is naturally a political animal and that whosoever is naturally and not accidentally unfit for society must be either inferior or superior to man  he that is incapable of society or so complete in himself as not to want it makes no part of a city as a beast or a god
  i think that comes down to how broadly you define political but at least narrative art will hold some kind of thought for the creator or viewer
  i think you misunderstood schmitt he basically says the opposite of what youre saying his complaint isnt that liberalism isnt political enough not that its too political
politics is the extension of ethics applied onto the behaviour of the masses insofar as they impose rules upon each other and act with the intention of impacting the collectivity sociology and social anthropology partly overlap with political science in this respect  ethics is in turn the branch of philosophy that explores the causes for actions and casts judgement upon them according to their correspondence with moral values  ethics and aesthetics fit into a branch of philosophy id call the philosophy of values  metaphysics deals with being all that is is a being pure truths free from all subjective judgements or opinions are what metaphysics seeks to find kikes should be gassed is an example of a statement that is subjectively true according to a certain persons set of values and it is objectively true that a person like an average stormfront user might almost certainly believe in this subjective truth therefore metaphysics would seek to understand the mode by which a belief comes into being and how it exists in relation to factual objective truths  a person is only political in relation to others and the ways by which they are all governed by the same set of rules but on their own their thoughts and experiences are more likely to be interpreted by psychology which is turn a part of metaphysics  therefore art is metaphysical tv is metaphyiscal frogposting is metaphysical
  based and collectivistpilled
in some way i guess but usually i see this posted in response to someone saying that video games or movies shouldnt be packed full with some kind of fringe political agenda its stupid because obviously they mean politically controversial not just involving something that could be construed as political if we were working under a completely different set of assumptions also video games arent art and i dont care if they are wish people wouldnt project this worry so much
  yes
  dont post that fucking picture dont make me remember that scumbag
  it is when looking through the lens of politically unstable pair of glasses that have nothing else going on in their lives
  politics can be inferred from anything but not everything is reducible to politics
  this
absolutely disgustingly apocalyptically bad you know how i said that through the panama felt longer than soundtracks for the blind this feels like an hour long album with bad pacing    its 16 minutes long    this album is a complete meme and not in an itaots way where you have to realise that the album is more than a meme not in a grimes way where you just have to ignore the fanbase not in a death grips way where you have to put yourself in a certain state of mind or even in a lil pump/peep/xan/pretty much every lil _____ except lil ugly mane way where you have to have an iq under 60 and take at least 5 xanax preferably not laced with fentanyl too soon i would much rather listen to gucci gang for 15 minutes than this    no this album is a meme starting right from where i found it a 2017 aoty thread on /mu/ with op desperately shilling/baiting this album its a meme from the cover to the genre experimental postnightcore  try saying that with a straight face to the song bass塊 which is essentially an earrape meme that lasts 2 minutes and 45 seconds    this album takes pixie vocals from grimes except theyre samples and theyre sped up to be even higher the experimental nature from death grips except when this album does it it has massive air quotes around experimental the mindnumbing repetition from the lilrappersexceptlil ugly mane the idea of an album under 25 minutes from lil peep is it okay to criticise his music yet and xxxtentacion which is nice to minimise the pain but results in even less substance and the irritating anime aesthetic from nightcore why to make an album which cannot be taken seriously or enjoyed unironically without having suffered severe brain damage if you can release 10 albums in 2016 youre clearly not trying very hard
  i really want to reach out and help plastic neesound out of this dark stage in his/her/xyr life he/she/xe/it really needs to stop using tumblr and /mu/ its so sad that they can be compared in some aspects and realise that irony and anime aesthetics will not get you everywhere    on the bright side i now have a 05 rating to show off that isnt quite as tryhard as reviewing brokencyde or jacob sartorius
  the polis was a mistake
  no everything including art and literature is indicative of the artists/writers core beliefs but not necessarily ones political beliefs
the personal is political was a meme started by feminists to get back at their shitty boyfriends and intelecrualize their interpersonal relationships then it spiraled out into retard territory
  everything in the world is about sex except sex sex is about power
  please start reviewing music    bravo anon
  why do people study metaphysics if it is completely objective
  i think you can make an argument for it being so yes  even the availability of cultural items such as art and literature can be political eg in discussions about censorship or poverty  but discussing things like that makes you fucking boring so its best not to think about it really
  metaphysicians dont actually study metaphysics itself they study the metaphysical aspects of physical stuff the meta of metaphysics is pataphysics which isnt actually philosophy but rather an absurdist parody of it
  thanks anon before reading this i actually didnt really know what metaphysics was because i thought even caring about such a term that isnt the real study of matter and energy or any other science studying the real world would be a stupid waste of time youve changed my mind this could be useful
  im not sure whether or not youre being serious most likely not but i did notice you used the word useful  traditional aristotelian physics and metaphysics studies the causes and ends of matter as it develops into specific or particular forms  what is said to be useful is that which has fulfilled its end through which it becomes capable of being used by something for the sake of doing something else  a skeptic philosopher like pyrrho of elis or david hume would claim that use is just a human invention a projection of ones feelings onto the reality of things therefore no action can be said to be more valuable than anything else  a person who is eternally depressed and under unbearable pain will have no desire to survive and will thus find no use in taking care of their house  a person who hates music will never be able to enjoy going to a concert or listening to a rock music cd the same way somebody who loves music would  there might be ends which things develop into for example all humans eventually die and turn into humus but use itself depends almost exclusively on individual emotional inclinations
people who politicize art should be shot    this is my only political position
  im saying that with a decent amount of observation on a person it could be used to predict certain things about that person
  also thanks for the post i appreciate your well rounded reply anon
  is there more of it
  please elaborate
  no you fuckerimg libtard
  not everything but specially art    in the sense that we are all socially conditioned then everything is political but thats a buzz phrase used to manipulate the rubes
  nice
no    the tendency of reducing everything to the political is a sign of modern decadence
you have it backwards everything including politics is art
  youre implying that i agree with schmitts premise he thinks we cant go back to the neutral state of the 19th century and are stuck with the total state i think we can go back and should    this of course would mean an end of popular democracy but id be willing to sacrifice that for a more civil general conduct
  no nothing has to be inherently political however anyone can read a political interpretation of anything
we have fought during 15 days for a single house writes a   german officer with mortars grenades machine guns and   bayonets already by the third day 54 german corpses are strewn   in the cellars on the landings and the staircases the front is   a corridor between burntout rooms it is the thin ceiling   between two floors help comes from neighboring houses by fire   escapes and chimneys there is a ceaseless struggle from noon to   night from story to story faces black with sweat we bombard   each other with grenades in the middle of explosions clouds of   dust and smoke heaps of mortar floods of blood fragments of   furniture and human beings ask any soldier what half an hour of   handtohand struggle means in such a fight and imagine   stalingrad 80 days and 80 nights of handtohand struggles the   street is no longer measured by meters but by corpses   stalingrad is no longer a town by day it is an enormous   cloud of burning blinding smoke it is a vast furnace lit by the   reflection of the flames and when night arrives one of those   scorching howling bleeding nights the dogs plunge into the   volga and swim desperately to gain the other bank the nights of   stalingrad are a terror for them animals flee this hell the   hardest stones can not bear it for long only men endure     fuck if thats not haunting and beautiful written by a german officer at stalingrad    post some more preferably from the eastern front of wwii
the following isnt from some diary but spoof orders written by germans    you must remember that you are entering a national socialist country whose living conditions are very different to those to which you have become accustomed you must be tactful with the inhabitants adapting to their customs and refrain from the habits which you have come to love so much   food do not rip up the parquet or other kinds of floor because potatoes are kept in a different place   curfew if you forget your key try to open the door with the roundshaped object only in cases of extreme urgency use a grenade   defence against partisans it is not necessary to ask civilians the password and open fire on receiving an unsatisfactory answer   defence against animals dogs with mines attached to them are a special feature of the soviet union german dogs in the worst cases bite but they do not explode shooting every dog you see although recommended in the soviet union might create a bad impression   relations with the civil population in germany just because somebody is wearing womens clothes does not necessarily mean that she is a partisan but in spite of this they are dangerous for anyone on leave from the front   general when on leave back in the fatherland take care not to talk about the paradise existence in the soviet union in case everybody wants to come here and spoil our idyllic comfor

is there a greater public intellectual who happens to be a bishop than he i dont know anyone as well rounded as he
  i started attending church again recently and a literal african priest recommended him thank you based black man
  what has your experience been like considering doing the same i cant say i sincerely believe but i think it would be beneficial might even spark some belief
hes a fantastic communicator and i look forward to me and others seeing more of him     not really /lit/ to be honest
  its fine so far i got interested in it through some exposure to catholic philosophy and concluded that they were in fact on to something after all not like they teach you any of this stuff in rcia though lel
  lmao a black guy recommended him to me too not that it matters but funny cuz its 4chan and everyones racist here
  alright thanks ive been reading theology and medieval philosophy a good bit the past year and find it engaging despite not believing in god
  i always rec this as a starter     
  not that anon but how do you think itll help i dont know what church youre planning to go back to but are you thinking of consistent attendance or sit in for mass once every 3 weeks    i also came back to the church after like a year of discernment however going to mass was the final step so its probably the opposite to whatever path youre planning

  not him    stanley hauerwas says christian faith is gained through the witness of other christians christianity is an alternative to modernity those who argue for its historical proof or scientific validity undermine its ability to stand on its own legs as an alternative another way to say that is do not look to archaelogists and clever ethicists to make christianity amenable to what you already believe is truth look to the holy spirit to change entirely your understanding of the meaning true and recognize its work through the merciful beautiful shocking and life transforming acts of a christian community a church     the modern secular liberal order will not be beat at its own game and a christian symbolification of this worldview is not really an alternative to it     i dont know about this jesus fellow either but i know his followers act in accordance with a truth my soul has discerned and science could not prove     you shall love your crooked neighbor with your crooked heart

  as a nonreligious person in terms of catholic televangelists i prefer fulton sheen fulton sheen is in the habit of making silly comments sometimes but only because as a rule he said braver and more didactic things than barronwhen he hits he really strikes gold bishop barron seems like a very friendly and intelligent person but a lot of his commentary is relatively forgettable
  theyre different speakers of different times but of course we are probably seeing a difference in temperament to an extent i believe sheen was from an era where religious individuals could be much more direct without career suicide or intense social reprecussions when voicing an opinion barron i believe takes a much more intentionally calculated and nuanced approach for the sake of luring people in he has brought in many many people from this day and age and i believe it because he understands the diagnosis people want knowledge but they also want conversational disarmingly considerate and playful just like jesus of course jesus can pipe up when he wants to and it is appropriate but i think they are just different people from different times the relatively forgettable comment i believe is unfounded but it is your opinion
  thats true youre right probably uncharitable of me to characterise it as a strong difference in quality when the intended effect is differentthough obviously subjectively to me sheen seems like a much stronger rhetorician and aphorist barron is a catholic and wants to bring people to the fold and his success speaks to the correctness of his approach with regard to that goal alone i dont think he compromises or waters down his faith and he doesnt have that pathetic pleading vibe a lot of apologists have but whereas sheens audience would generally be catholics or cultural christians barrons evangelism exists in a context where even most lay believers are disillusioned with the church and distrustful of the clergy at the same time barrons tone can be wishywashy and obviously lacks the conviction and sometimes camp theatricality that makes sheen so mesmerising
  pretty astute observation ive heard people complain that his stance is weak but in my opinion its usually him being tactful in a situation that requires mutual comprehension without the unnecessary risk of amplified conviction i find he is usually conversing with people who are highly skeptical anyway so i think he in my opinion successfully applies both the immovable stance without posing an offensive position i really think what you said about sheen being theatrical is a perfect attribution sheen is essentially a performer in his work him and his message are one his expression is integral to wha he is conveying i dont think barron would consider himself in that vein at least to sheens extent barron strikes me as a deep intellectual who is socially apt and has a willingness to share to me his genius is how he distills complicated and nuanced subjects for the new comer and makes it engaging palatable but not overly simplistic very rare quality we all know he can take people down a rabbit hole of confusion if he wanted to but he understands his mission i find him very selfless

i want to learn italian so i can read dante but i keep seeing people say that his archaic italian is too different than the modern language yet i cant find any books or courses to learn dantes italian can anyone point me in the direction to learning archaic italian
  i cant decide whether to learn italian or spanish spanish has more use cases and the women are better looking but i have a fondness for italy
  if you can read italian well dante shouldnt pose too great a problem   there are dozens of resources online that provide different translations as well as footnotes like digital dante and princeton dante project   if you havent already you should read about the political context of the comedy the ghibellini/il popoli/ the black and white guelphs and then also the state of the roman empire at the time     also investigate dantes poetry and his philosophy that he wrote before the comedy   final thing to read about is if you want a comparison between dante and a contemporary poet read some of il tesoretto
  i dont think there are many resources regarding mediaeval italian my guess is that youll have to learn modern italian and then work your way down
  op here ive decided to just kill myself instead thanks anyway
  good choice

can we all agree that if you dont drop at least 80 of books you have no discerning taste in literature   modern readers is too spooked out by the notions of completionism and it gets better 200 pages in
  what if youre reading through nothing but great classics from tolstoy hugo brontes shakespeare etc why would you drop things you enjoy    surely you have no taste if you drop 80 of everything you read why would you want to finish books so infrequently if you enjoyed reading  im not sure what point youre really trying to make op but you just sound foolish
what the fuck was billies problem
im not much into reading books for pleasure i mean im more into music to pass my time i can read through lyrics to decipher them but reading books hasnt been my thing   im very emotional and distance myself from everyone so as no one will exploit me at the same time i can be at times very manipulative and bad to people overthinking and anxiety is some thing that i go through on a day to day basis i sometimes lack self worth and find it hard to imagine why people are friend with me i can study for hours from a book but havent tried reading to pass time now i want to explore and kinda open myself to some new things hence writing this post    i want to get into reading books that are philosophical or explain why we think the way we think if there is anything like that do recommend me     this is my first post here and want recommendations from you guys thanks  inb4 new fag
op here  i have albert camus books with me  the myth of sisyphus  the stranger and the fall   but i havent still read them
  do it then
  again another newfag asks for philosophical books but not the foundations to understanding philosophy dude you cant just really dive into philosophical writings and expect to understand them if you dont read much in the first place camus isnt a bad place to start and if you already own the stranger thats a good book too but it wont offer much insight as to why you are the way you are more than anything the stranger is like a cautionary tale about how not to be    if you want books similar to the stranger read a confederacy of dunces and dostoevskys the double followed by notes from underground notes is accessible but you must be patient with it  theres a reason why the first half of the book feels like nonsensical rambling      but really if youre new to reading you got to get yourself used to a good reading schedule 5 or 10 pages a day or read for a solid hour or two and increase that once you feel more engrossed in a book or more capable to read more try to turn off your internet connection and turn off your phone if youre easily distracted    and find some books that are accessible i recommended some books that are accessible if youre used to reading frequently but if youre not you may find them a bit tiresome or dry especially since youre asking for books that tackle philosophical topics    read some easy peasy books anon stuff from the /lit/ starter kit are so easy you could get through them quickly and build up that healthy reading routine you seem like you want to develop reading easy books can encourage you to read more and it helps establish your ability to read 10  20 20  50 pages without distraction more easily than jumping straight into some plato or heidegger would plus most of us on /lit/ have already read these so once youve finished reading one and start another its a lot easier to strike up a conversation about these books for someone new to reading
  a clockwork orange  american psycho  every time
  thanks for the kind words anon   i just want to know myself and get a better understanding of what i am while stopping myself from falling into the same pitfalls i have earl sweatshirt danny brown and radiohead are some of my favourite acts i like satire and things that are relatable to me    foundations for understanding philosophy  what stuff would you recommend me to get a better understanding of the said subject what would you recommend      my friend recommended me ready player one and i read about 70 of the book and gave up i didnt match my taste
  what id recommend is that you just read more diving straight into philosophy is a surefire way to give up reading altogether if you havent even got a good reading schedule in place and if you dont even have the foundations of reading in place    out of accessible works that cover political spiritual and philosophical areas theres plenty george orwell might be a meme here because of 1984 and animal farm but if you havent read those yet do that check out down and out in paris and london if youre interested in the working class struggle    read malcolm xs autobiography if you want to learn about spiritual growth and understanding that doesnt necessarily mean religion but malcolm x was someone stuck in a criminal rut and while serving time he wanted to better himself and it eventually led to his spiritual transformation into the nation of islam and then true islam you dont have to be black or muslim to appreciate the strength gained in trying to improve your situation    philip k dicks do androids dream of electric sheep covers topics of empathy and the struggle to obtain what is unobtainable    im not recommending outright philosophy because it really would be silly to dive straight into philosophy when youve literally admitted youre not into reading much philosophy is dry when youve not built up a foundation of reading material again camus dostoevsky and confederacy of dunces are also pretty good op    get into philosophy at a later time theres honestly no rush many books tackle themes and subjects that are philosophical existential political spiritual etc in an attempt to understand who we are and why just start with those first op if youre new to reading straight up philosophy will burn you out    get some greeks greek plays like lysistrata prometheus bound and the oresteia are great and accessible too
  theyre literally easypeasy anon plenty of people read those in college the only thing daunting about them is certain terminology in a clockwork orange and american psycho being repetitive as shit american psycho is overrated but its easy and a clockwork orange usually has a glossary of all the slang terminology but even then the context of certain words can make it easy to understand what that word means
  id reccommed you to read a philosophy manual if you want to get into it it will give you a brief understanding of most western philosophy and then you can pick more books from the authors youre itnerested in    as some other anon said in this same board once you should then dive into the modern philosophers from descartes onwards because they practically dismiss philosopical tradition adn start anew with new topics that may interest you then you can go back into plato aristotle and the presocratics if you want to dive into harder philosophers like kant or hegel who make more use of philosophical tradition than their predecessecors and even some of their contemporary intellectuals    but if you are really more interested in knowing yourself more then you should instead read psicology books again maybe an introductory manual may come in handy and then you can dive into the authors you like the most i personally like the interpretation of dreams by freud

  take risks learn your real feelings by interacting and confronting other people your fears and society writing is a good thing to do just journal every day think about your past and things you have done and how you are different today   reading can be bad for you
  i have tried writing things down i wouldnt say it doesnt help  but what i have noticed is that the more i start getting into people i kinda fuck up some thing or the other    when i go to read things i wrote in the past  it makes me realise that i never wanted to interact with people and forcing interaction doesnt work   though writing things down has helped me change my destructive behaviour but i dont know if the reason was writing it down or just growing up
  you have changed growing up as you say and most interactions are somewhat forced think of it like exercise it is just as important if you want to live life and know yourself
  what is the book equivalent of atrocity exhibition by danny brown atrocity exhibition by jg ballard is too analytical in its writing style so maybe junky by burroughs

  the aesthetics of mathematics are concealed to nonmathematicians
some of them are too hard to read for common philosophiles need a great effort with no romantic approach but yeah they were the ones that changed me the most to date
  they never got any quality pussy
  logic has nothing to do with mathematics no one in mathematics cares what logicians do
analytic philosophy has its own aesthetic their goal was to break everything down as small as it could go there wasnt any room for romanticism
romanticism is explicitly a synthetic approach to the world the act of romanticizing is a synthetic process romanticism also values strong emotion more than cold reason
  why is reason always characterized as cold emotion can be cold and reason can lead to warmth
i postulate that the highest ideal of human ethical behavior is essentially and exactly for persons to cooperate rather than to compete for in the cooperation of persons there is a corresponding maximum of overall satisfaction pursuant to kants categorical imperative a principke and a quantitative empirical observations of utilitarian maximality via survey data thus i propose we cooperate rather than compete and since competition is exactly that which is entailed by the darwinian nature of sexuality i believe we ought to have each other and also unto death for a reflexive relation of equality is undone in a temporal constraint which might leave one or other of two contractual signatories less happy than another also nothing subsumes identity like an intersection of self and others interests baby though my logic is irrefutable i permit myself occasional lapses into non rational and non empirical behaviors and so ask    will you marry me xor not  really gets the ladies that

muh zeno  the universe is composed of particles not monolithic matter fuck off
  hello neighbor i came over to borrow particles of sugar  hey bro can you lend me a particle im starving  fucking chads and staceys and their fucking perfect particles i fucking hate them reeeeee
  human understanding of and interaction with the universe is moderated via crude heuristics and not good evidence for the nature of reality
  im colorblind therefore color doesnt exist
  the universe is composed of particles not monolithic matter  it depends  it depends on what your meaning of is is    eyerolljpg
  get better instruments its made of waves i tell you bro
  this paradox assumes an infinitely divisible distance and a finite timeframe which we really cant assume
 op    not cool bro
  waves and particles are just fields interacting yo
    you do realize that the qualia of color is not inherent to the object being perceived a human with normal vision does not see things more realer than the color blind person only that which the construction of their organism allows them to qualitatively experience in their umwelt
  they absolutely do people with full colour vision are able to distinguish a greater spectrum of wavelengths its why this test works
      nothing categorically distinguishes the visible spectrum of electromagnetic radiation from invisible portions of the broader spectrum in this sense color is not a property of electromagnetic radiation but a feature of visual perception by an observer
  but colourblindness is an inability to distinguish various wavelengths regardless of (((qualia)))
  better range and granularity of perception equals greater appreciation of reality
dont have anything to contribute but this thread has potential thats quite rare for neo/lit/ thanks for trying anons
the universe is diffraction sis not things
    go ahead and imagine redness note how you can imagine space without redness but cannot imagine a redness that exists in space   now go ahead and attempt to imagine that same color and hue of redness only this imagine it as less so note how you can not imagine or see an instance of redness that is less red than all the other rednesses of that kind
  but cannot imagine a redness that does not exist in space
  youre taking the original comment too literally    im colorblind therefore color doesnt exist  could be more accurately put as  im colorblind therefore those wavelengths of light i cannot distinguish are the same
  youve gotten confused somewhere along the way take a step back from trying to lecture us and instead formulate your thoughts more clearly
  if you cant take a step back and tell me why you think i am confused then this response is worthless    my point is universals are real
  no thats my point
  whoa were halfway there  whoa were halfway there  whoa were halfway there
  arent you saying that universals like red correlate to reality through the copula of being percieved by an observer does that not make them mere correlations the realist position is that universals correlate to reality as esse in futūro like the concept of red purposes the existence of red in space the existence of wavelengths that are percieved as red when and if they are percieved in nature purposes the existence of red things in nature of course this purposed redness has an indeterminate existence too imagine red you need to imagine that it exists as a quality of space that quality can exist in a full plane of redness a red triangle a red zebra it doesnt matter the only thing red purposes is its existence in space so of course the quality of red may appear different to different observers but its reality isnt the quality of existence its the existence of something that purposes an indeterminate universal quality like redness whats real is the proposition not the conclusion
  sure we can i just did
this is why stemfags laugh at you
  red is a band of em wavelengths something being red means that it reflects emits transmits some part of that band of wavelengths its an emergent property of a bunch of atoms that have orbital bandgaps that correlate to an energy which correlates to wavelengths within the aforementioned red band
  kekk      thats true im a mathfag internally chuckling at these mathlets
that 25 year old kuffar who believes the dunya is real
  no thats just the kind of sign vessel that the purposed quality of redness is carried in       how is calc 2 going sport
  no thats just red

cant imagine anyone ever caring about me enjoying my company and loving me    books for this feel asking for a friend
  a book to resolve this feel or a book to make it stronger
  not him but preferably resolve      i suppose kafka would be a good start
the bible    god loves and cares about you anon
  i feel the same man im looking for the cure too
  not real
    no one cares for anyone else neither is he cared for by anyone no one enjoys anyones company neither is his company enjoyed by anyone no one loves anyone else neither is he loved by anyone this is most true when one entertains such things relative to an other for all that is entertained as being of an other and not of ones self is wholly of ones self and not of an other

  isnt this homophobic
  no its how gays write about themselves
  but thats still homophobic theyre internalizing sexist attitudes
  shut up bourgeois breeder insisting we must fall in line with your cult of selflove policing queer attitudes selfhatred is the noblest thing a queer can aspire to not because of his faggotry but because his faggotry and the alienation it engenders gives him a front row seat to the human condition which is abjection and sickness yes the maggots the worms the red light district demons bacterial stench infected niggers niggerzombies pedo buskers welcome to the deep city the fuck club its open for business
what is the dickensian aspect and how is it reproduced on the wire
story from the point of view of lowlife scumbags aa the common man or as marxists call them glorious unsung heroes of society who despite being wiser and nobler than the evil bourgeois never get a fair shake

oozing sappy sentimental misery porn in this case mixed with blaxploitation made by members of and intended for consumption by a higher social class or more recently a more privileged identity group than that of the hapless losers depicted who use the form for emotional catharsis in a moral inversion of classical tragedy which necessarily revolved around heros nobles and gods not subhuman trash    always a naive bourgeois heavily romanticized fantasy projection written by an author who is of a higher class who needs to virtuesignal and whose only personal stake is the emotional high they get from feeling superior by virtue of excessive compassion because they are terminal endstage degenerate christcucks and/or jews no difference t the greeks and like to get paid for their emotional labor while not actually helping anyone and promoting every kind of social pathology    dickens was a literal communist and should have been exposed as an infant his writing sucks too fuckwit was the second coming  in his own mind
what are some books like gummo aka treating the lower classes like youre making a documentary about the third world and exposing them for the low intelligence feral but nonetheless tragic beings they are
  the short story tell the women were going by raymond carver
  gummo is more noble than because it is genuinely affectionate toward dumb retard subhumans as they actually are instead of sterilised educated wypipo souls in nigger costumes sooo brave

ahem
  some guy in his pajamas having a bad dream yaaaaawn
  why do you have a genuine opinion on why this shitty poem about ship inventory and dudes stabbing each other in dicks is the greatest literary thing ever or you just mindlessly parrot whatever h blooms of the world tell you
  literally fanfiction tier
  homer was even worse retelling the stories that were a part of the folk/rhapsodic tradition  also vergil improves on and deviates from homer in so many aspects that anyone who sees him as a mere copyist must have no reading comprehension
  kek
  its cute that you think iliad wasnt a fanfiction of some previously existing work which was probably lost in history literally the only original literary work ever created is an epic short poem called on how ooga the rock destroyed booga the mammoth written in stick figures on a cave wall some 10000bc every other work to follow was just a derivative

  so the answer is no gotcha

   shitty poem about ship inventory   the ship catalog is literally only 5 pages out of 400    dont think you read it mate
how good are translations of shakespeare and ulysses ive always wondered
  shakespeares are okayish ulysses are monstruosities and travestites
  shakespeares are like translations are niv of the bible okayish like fellow/lit/izen said  there wont be any bumps in the language but also the poetic beauty of elizabethan prose and poetry is gone ulysses is modern english no need to translate wtf are there actually translations
  i mean into other languages you fucking moron
  read it in english you fucking spaz you clearly read the language well
  hes wondering have you ever heard of curiosity
  its not always that easy to get books in english
  i have polish translation of ulysses but i dont want to read it until i read dubliners and portrait so ill hit you up in the future
  ive read some of the old hungarian translation of ulysses the guy wrote a new book on the framework of joyce its pretty fun
at the very northern tip of manhattan lies one of the last wild places in new york city a swath of ancient forest that has survived more or less undisturbed for hundreds of years on an overcast afternoon the park is relatively quiet save for the occasional squawk of migrating geese and the distant groan of the metronorth winding up the hudson a solitary jogger lopes along a dirt path edging the dense woods i love this park because its the last of the forest as it used to be before we showed up and fucked up everybodys shit fantasy writer nk jemisin tells me as we set off through the woods her hands tucked pensively into the pockets of a long gray cardigan after a moment she adds an important caveat well i mean technically my ancestors werent fucking anybody up they were just being fucked up that said   she drifts off her eyes on the red oaks overhead reality always creeps into jemisins fantasies whether she wants it to or not    were here on a research expedition to gather details for a scene in her new trilogy which she describes as a magical battle for the soul of new york city over the last decade jemisin a former practicing psychologist has become one of the worlds most acclaimed authors of science fiction and fantasy known for crafting richly imagined fantastical realms and melding elements like mysterious sentient floating crystals with searing critiques of contemporary political power structures for her new book she wanted to write something light and fun  a palate cleanser about tentacled monsters  but jemisin can never stay away from heavy themes for long partway through her first draft it dawned on her that the new book was really about gentrification and racism i just want to write about things blowing up gods and planets and moons crashing into things she tells me but what i write ends up being very political if i write about dragons im writing about dragons as a black woman and its fucking political
  jemisins phenomenal success has been something like an earthquake ripping through the traditional order of fantasy itself perhaps this explains why certain writers nearly all of them white men have taken issue with her rise but more on that later all together her work has sold a million copies in english and has been translated into 24 languages tnt is developing it as a tv show in 2016 the opening book in the trilogy won the hugo award for best novel science fiction and fantasys most prestigious honor she was the first black writer to win this award though she doesnt see this as a milestone worth celebrating it just emphasizes how flawed the field has always been she says the following year she won the hugo again this years win made her the first writer of any race to claim the award three years in a row for each book in a trilogy for perspective george rr martin has been nominated in that category four times but has never won neil gaiman a fan of jemisins and one of fantasys most bankable stars has won only twice the demands of success have not disrupted her torrid writing pace when shes on deadline jemisin aims for 3000 words a day and has managed to publish ten books in just the past eight years her latest how long til black future month out this week is a collection of short stories her first book to be released in hardback
  damn powerful
yikes yipes yeesh
by lila shapiro  shapiro  interesting surname that finnish
  damn hard hitting transgressive stuff middle aged white men take a knee
  why this
jemisin draws even more heavily on psychology and sociology than on the hard sciences in a seminar on worldbuilding that she occasionally gives at writing conferences she encourages aspiring writers to read classic works on the history of human civilization like jared diamonds guns germs and steel
  haha holy shit this bitch is a walking meme
i only read the first post but i honest to god cannot tell if its satire or not
  can we stop giving attention to these people please
a black woman has gone to the grocery store to buy some milk as a black and a woman she ponders as a woman and as a black what milk is right for me grasping a milk carton in her strong black woman hand she at last makes a decision a decision deeply resonant with her identity as a woman who is black indeed with women and blacks everywhere she marches to the register with a spring in her step and places the milk down onto the counter as a strong powerful important black woman i  a black woman  would like to purchase this milk the cashier rings her up that will be two dollars and eightynine cents he says practically sneering at her for being a black woman the black woman defiantly raises her black womanly hand a bold defiant symbol of her brave defiance as a black woman to silence the racist cashier your racism wont hold me down im going to purchase this milk whether you like it or not she hands over the money to the racist cashier who says what clearly stupefied by the bold defiance of this black woman she marches out of the grocery store with her head held high and steals a slim jim not so much as a woman mostly as a black that time
  guns germs and steel  holy cringe
  lmao
  she marches out of the grocery store with her head held high and steals a slim jim not so much as a woman mostly as a black that time    kekd  would nominate for a hugo
  unbelievably refreshing as a middle aged white man  this is him i thought these fags werent gonna breed
  jogging    yeah right she looked so good on her author pic in the 5th season what happened
  do niggers even have dragons
  she marches out of the grocery store with her head held high and steals a slim jim not so much as a woman mostly as a black that time
  lost out loud at the ending fucking kek
  they appropriated them from the yellow people
  same ive never heard of her leaning towards satire
  implying thats his kid
  10/10
  that pained uncomfortable half smile  those dead eyes  every tiem
  she really needs to stop appropriating european literature and things like english and books and asian mythology
  im writing about dragons as a fat black woman and its fcking political  but why though why does she have to make it political cant she just write a good piece of literature without the political crutch/shield against criticism    its all so tiresome
  yeah but a dragon stole eddie murphy from her in shrek 2 so if she doesnt make it political she just looks jel you know
  this reminds me of sneaker ads
  oh gee i wonder what her politics could possibly be
  well well well if it isnt reddit
  because a dragon cant just be a dragon it has to be a symbol of the white mans power over her that way she can kill it and feel good about herself everything has to be political because everything has a fuck you to someone
  this cant be real    you live in a reality where popular writers call blatantly revisionistic histories classics
  good story submit it to a flash fiction blog
  welcome to the ministry of truth anon things were always this way
im a progressive and i dont mind those themes in literature if their done with tact problem with it is faggots write the same banal hamfisted regurgitation of the liberaldemocratic status quo and then try to make it digestible by painting on genre tropes   when pressed on the lack of subtly or creativity they go on the defensive and say it was on purpose and pretend like its something revolutionary that they should be proud of
finally its about time someone dared to speak out
  god damn these people are pathetic quivering worms
imagine taking yourself seriously as a writer and swearing in an interview imagine taking yourself seriously as a journalist and publishing swear words in the headline
  dont they order their books and choose the ratio themselves
  i imagine being james ellroy all the time anon
  its been tried before
  her debut novel the hundred thousand kingdoms was nominated for the 2010 nebula award and shortlisted for the james tiptree jr award  the james tiptree jr award is an annual literary prize for works of science fiction or fantasy that expand or explore ones understanding of gender   the hundred thousand kingdoms also won the sense of gender awards in 2011    truely the reigning fantasy queen just look at these awards
   james tiptree jr award is an annual literary prize for works of science fiction or fantasy that expand or explore ones understanding of gender  tiptrees rolling in her grave she only came up with the pseudonym to not be the first female in another field she succeeded in
  after a moment she adds an important caveat well i mean technically my ancestors werent fucking anybody up they were just being fucked up that said  
 which she describes as a magical battle for the soul of new york city  so is it a bunch of former yuppies fighting woke nowyuppies for who can serve wall street the best
  neoyuppies
  not progressive enough    a bunch of fat black and latinx gender nonconforming sex workers resist the the forces of cis heteropatriarchal white supremacists attempting to build coffee shops in poor neighbourhoods

  it doesnt say what type of milk she chose
  thats not significantly different from what i said
  lots of awards yet ive never heard of her and cant readily find any information on how well her books sell hmmm
  chocolate
  you made your point simply and concisely thats wrong you need to cram in as many buzzwords as possible even if you have only a faint idea of what they mean if your message isnt a convoluted mess of jargon youre clearly uneducated and need to go study a gender degree
  the eternal bantu strikes again
  couldnt all the time spent turning the books then turning them back later been spent on i dunno writing a work of fiction
  cant she just write a good piece of literature  obviously not
  thats very white cis male thinking there mate
america is not sentient
  as a woman and as a black what milk is right for me
  she marches out of the grocery store with her head held high and steals a slim jim not so much as a woman mostly as a black that time  lmao
  reminds me of the feminist bookstore skit from portlandia
  they filmed that segment at the store    the volunteerrun space gained a national profile thanks to its association with portlandia though in other words later made headlines for repudiating the ifc sketch comedy show
  wonder if the owner of the store knew what they were shooting though portlandia never did meanspirited satire
    dragons arguing pige etc
  he cute
  but blacks are like intolerant of lactose and stuff
  fucking who
  i bet almost all of she sales are from libraries it a racket
  deadass read that as how long until black people shut the fuck up and had to doubletake
  fucking kek
  ever time i become afraid 4channel is becoming reddit i read actual reddit posts and thank allah that were miles away from it
  i keep hearing bantu being thrown around unless her ancestors are from central or south africashe isnt
  undisturbed for hundreds of years    for being the kind of people that pretend to care about the environment they are not very educated about it
  and steals a slim jim not so much as a woman mostly as a black that time  jesus christ anon you should be proud of yourself for that line alone
is everybody in the thread missing the point shes not complaining about muh racism shes just saying it creeps into her work when she just wants to write fun genre book
  what a rollercoaster bravo
  its just a way of speaking everybody killed each other everywhere always
  bantus originally came from western africa
    how do people become as pathetic as this the world would honestly be a better place if these people werent in it
  the weak subsidize the lifestyle of the strong without mindless consumerism i couldnt make stock gains year over year without the unintelligent i couldnt benefit from cheap labour and without beta cucks my physique and personality wouldnt stand out to women be thankful for the rabble
  central africa i believe then migrated south conquering and genociding as they went anyone who thinks privative cultures are peaceful and fucking delusional
  yep she was just so oblivious to her own work that she didnt even notice it over 500 pages in she suddenly realized oh it seems like im unexpectedly writing about racism again for the tenth book on a row
  i want to laugh at this reddit thread so badly anyone got a link
    here anon have fun 
  the bantuspeaking peoples migrated from western africa near modernday nigeria southward and eastward spreading out across all of the southern half of the african continent    t wikipedia
oh no a black woman is writing popular fiction and has opinions something has to be done
  just wait until the boys at the redpill book club hear about this one a fine addition to our cringe comp indeed
    i have been reading fantasy and sci fi shit my entire life and ive never heard of her her success is due to the cancer infecting the genre and prices how meaninglessness the awards have become
  shes clearly an industry plant
  not a plant but definitely a darling shes black shes a woman and her politics are correct so her skills as a writer are of secondary consideration
  incredibly based and astonishingly redpilled
  effeminate passiveaggressive sarcasm  why is this the only sort of response you people ever make
  effeminate passiveaggressive critism of effeminate passiveaggressive sarcasm  omg i literally cant even fuck off turd sucker
  black people are so fucking black that they can neither write nor speak nor think about anything else apart from being black    but the thing is society is constantly reminding them that they are black and constantly telling them that to be black is to be politically involved ergo when women the most narcissistic first class citizens in the us decide to write and by some star birth are black than everthing they do is lauded as black activism even if it is swearing while communicating nothing in an interview
  bravo anon i genuinely laughed out loud
  good job the ending had me in stitches
  lol
  put me in the screenshot
i dont understand why everyone itt is so angry
  probably cos they cant write 3000 words a day like the woman in op
                                          based and redpilled and not one samefag
  theyre just following the state religion this is why i think in a way correcting the course of society wouldnt be that hard progressivism requires massive levels of reality denial and relentless propagandization to get people to believe it so it wouldnt be that hard to use that apparatus to promote another more beneficial worldview
  the weak subsidize the lifestyle of the parasitic
  i didnt know hussie browsed /lit/ lmao
is her prose good
  she marches out of the grocery store with her head held high and steals a slim jim not so much as a woman mostly as a black that time  holy fucking shit where can we fund your first published book
  jokes aside the article makes such a big deal about her like shes the next big thing but i doubt literaly anyone has heard about her name or even her books by themselves
    i see a lot about her complaining about how white dudes are more popular than her
  writing a character who happens to be black with a slight intention of said black characters problem not being woe is the negro still plays into that right
im not american but why everything in america boils down to race    or is 4chan autism

  anal_lazer  lol i knew this post would bring out the racists classic /r/fantasy    literally every one in the thread is either  1 bowing down to her  2 giving very tip toe critisim like i really love her as a person but i didnt like this book are the others ones better
  every dissenting comment is either deleted or downvoted     still amazes me that downvoting is a thing creepy reddit people
  you ever feel like ideas are sometimes more powerful than the people who create them or brands
did anyone else think that was a weed plant behind her because she has dreadlocks
  incredible post

hello lit   i disliked for whom the bell tolls the stranger no longer human lord of the flies   i liked dune wind up bird chronicle hitchhikers guide to the galaxy montaignes essays    what would you recommend for me to read
  the bible alternatively my diary
  the fart sniffers almanac
    thank you
  mobydick amazing fucking book also although it might be a struggle at first the plays of shakespeare
  the only good book that youve listed is dune and you sound like the kind of retard who just liked it because hehe action and fighting funny    you also seem like you disliked the stranger because it was too complex for your ungadunga mind and didnt actually have any issues with its nonsensical circular and stolen philosophy if you understood it at all
  dune was good but the sequels were crap for the most part although godemp was ok he would have done better to diversify his ouput more and by the end he was cucked the old baron had a chaotic neutral grandeur in dune but the later books reduced him to a mere unpc villain also in dune judaism had disappeared along with every other religion and the jews had morphed into the sardaukar later he introduced a group of modern day crypto jews who being a more sensitive and based master race were able to secretly retain the exact same culture as they had in the 20th century unlike the goyim around them dont know why he retconned his series like that
  i just didnt care about any of the ideas in that book the guy just didnt care me neither really i also didnt care about the problems of that kid in no longer human i stopped reading it almost immediately same with for whom the bell tolls except i might have finished it i dont remember  does not being able to empathise with characters from these books make me a retard
  i actually wanted to read that next thanks i hope ill like it more than previous lits recommendations
  the stranger wasnt written for its plot it was written to espouse camus shitty stolen philosophy    its like atlas shrugged but somehow worse
  i was talking about moby dick
didnt like the stranger either camus did a good job transferring emotion to the reader the whole book felt like a sweltering hot headache so good job
  try k dick you might like him
  atlas shrugged wasnt bad you just dont like the authors ideology you cant separate ideology from its context in a work of fiction that or you have literally never read it and are jumping on a rddit bandwagon of hate
  i was actually a rabid objectivist when i was sixteen    now im a functional adult in society and think atlas shrugged was nothing more than a poorlywritten manifesto however the fountainhead was a good read
what would you recc me /lit/
i owe a debt to jordan peterson that is not repayable by material means i know hes gone out of fashion around here that hes turned into a figure of ridicule fit that is routinely satirized and poked fun at but after internalizing his wash your penis motto ive found my life radically transformed     since making sure to thoroughly wash my penis every morning ive found my sense of internal cohesion has strengthened immeasurably i asked out the girl i liked in the office jenny who ive since started dating we had sex for the first time this weekend and she said my penis was the freshest shed ever tasted my boss is giving me a raise after my conference proposals helped increase our profit by 15 in the last quarter ive started writing the novel i always said i would and my friend who works in publishing had a look over and said it has promise    so temper yourself when you go to make a sniggering dismissal of jordan peterson accompanied by a loweffort meme washing your penis works and it takes a sophisticated understanding of nietzsche jung dostoevsky the bible and canadian politics to fully appreciate
gordan memerson introduced me to jung which i am unironically thankful for

there was a boy named dimitri who had just died from the perspective of history he was but one of billions of deaths and he had only affected a relatively small amount of people in the grand scheme of the world he was a nobody he was a nothing    then why poor clueless tatiana wondered why do i hurt so much she hardly knew him in fact the furthest direct contact she had with him was at the door frame of a boys bathroom    in her first year at a new school she ran in a desperate hurry to find a restroom not paying attention to the symbols on the door he grabbed the ribbon on the back of her blouse right as she had pushed the door open she turned around and saw an ashen well fed boy about the same height as her if maybe a bit taller he had pale blue eyes that sunk into his head which was square with a messy mop of yellow hair on top his big mouth was molded into a caring smile    the girls bathroom is there he said pointing across the hallway his voice was deeper than normal for a fourth year student but was still soft to the ears as if his words were the warm and trusting hands of her father she blushed thanked him profusely and ran into the proper bathroom with her head looking at her shoes the whole time    this was the one and only interaction she ever had with the boy she woke out of her thoughts and was once again faced with a world in which he no longer existed she was so touched by that simple act of kindness so many years ago that now as a 18 year old woman she was looking out of her window from the top of a concrete dorm crying at the thought of him    she thought of all the things he couldve been a boy that kind could have been a wonderful doctor or perhaps a teacher whose students would have loved dearly she wiped her nose with her wool sleeve and pondered the tragedy that had unfolded
  his life was cut short before he had a chance to make himself a something a somebody history had but a mere sentence written in the blank pages of what wouldve been the book of dimitri the whole situation sent a chill through her scalp down to her feet and left the invisible hairs on her hand electrified she reached over to the newspaper on her bed which had delivered the story to her she read over it again    he was out at a café in moscow sitting outside during the tepid summer at a corner of an intersection out of nowhere on a tuesday morning when the particular road was usually empty a faded yellow vaz hit a pothole and flew into the outdoor tables he was hit and pinned against the wall of the cafe his abdomen was entirely crushed and his intestines had gotten lodged in the thin slits of the grill he didnt die instantly his funeral would be in four days and restricted to only family   the same cold from earlier washed over her and she shakily put the paper down the room was spinning   if i head to that street corner will his blood still be stained on the concrete it has to be if they wash it off hell be gone from this world forever they cant do that to him she thought she didnt even know what she meant by they but she knew they could and they would    she turned back to her window the city sprawled underneath her a gray vulture spreading its wings waiting for the next victim of fate to pick up after death was routine no matter the circumstances    she stared at his portrait that was placed in the newspaper he was smiling that same smile she had seen so long ago her hands petted the portrait she cut out the picture and put it in a drawer    then she turned off the lights and went to sleep at 4 in the afternoon
so this guy who lives alone goes down to a bar at 3 in the afternoon for a pint no one is there besides the bartender who he abhors so he orders an extra 2 pints just to be able to get though the small talk 5 minutes in hes throwing back the second beer and trying both to ignore what the bartender is saying and listen in out of sheer curiosity and boredom if you asked him why he listened at all hed tell it hed rather put a bullet in either ear than listen to this peppy fucker spew 10 more words from his gob like the piss flavored beer he served pouring out of the tap anyway he hears the guy say something while he cleans out the first empty glass which he practically picked up the second it was put down something about a man who had been in the bar the night before finishing the second beer he nearly winces when the bartender reaches out his hand to grab it from him and immediately considers punching him in the face before handing it to him begrudgingly he always drank the first 3 as fast as possible you get more drunk that way    have you met him before the bartender asks    who exactly he responds obvious oblivious to the one sided conversation as it were    the man in the tailcoat    oh yeah hes been here once or twice he says completely unaware of who the man in the tailcoat was    really ive only ever seen him here the one time i guess you really are just here more than i am the bartender responds with the most infuriating grin one could imagine    what followed was a few minutes of silence with only the sound of a rag cleaning glasses and a mug being set down on the counter to be heard only until the bell rang signaling the door being opened did anything worth remarking happen
  the man himself said the bartender    a man in a tailcoat sits down at the bar and asks for a glass of water    how was your anniversary he says    it went perfectly says the bartender    did she like the gift    yes she said it was exactly what she was hoping for    thats good guess it was a good thing i was here wouldnt you say    a great thing really who else would have had those exact shoes for 10    i was on my way to the thrift shop when i decided to stop here for a pint my wife wont be needing them anymore    glad you did she really did love them    the man in the tailcoat pulls a gold stopwatch from his pocket checking it he says    i guess i didnt have as much time as i wouldve thought ill have to get going    he stands up and begins to leave the bar not before putting his hand on the shoulder of the other man and saying    next rounds on me eh    the bell chimes again and the man in the tailcoat is gone    what a character says the barkeep with the same grin    a real stand up guy the man says before finishing his third beer    before he could ask for another the bartenders phone rings checking the caller id with a puzzled look on his face he says    she never calls when im at work    flipping it open and pressing it to the side of his face he says    hello    his expression slowly changes from and inquisitive worry to one of utter terror and disbelief    wwait wwhat who is this why do you have my wifes phone    whats happening who is it says the man on the stool    ttheybroke says the bartender    what is it whats happening says the man on the stool    ookay ill be right there    whats going on is everything alright    mmy wife shshe fell    is she alright whats wrong    i have to go said the bartender before throwing on his coat and running out the door to his car    the bell stops ringing and the man is left alone in the bar he waits until the car is gone and reaches over the bar to pour himself another pint he catches a glimpse of something shiny out of the corner of his eye the gold pocket watch resting on a ten dollar note on the bar beside him he picks up the stopwatch and presses the button to open it it flips open and the man sees that there is only one hand and one tick at 12 o clock on the face of the watch it ticks closer and closer to 12 as he stares in disbelief why would anyone create a watch like this why would the man in the tailcoat pretend to check it before leaving why would he leave it on the counter suddenly the hand ticks one final time and reaches 12 he feels something cold pressed against his ear he turns to see the man in the tailcoat pointing a gun at his head before he could even think of why it was happening or why the bell never rang the man in the tailcoat says    be careful what you wish for    and a gunshot rings out through the streets
  i like the premise first sentence might be better if you cut it down to dimitri had just died more impact and the short syntax is a nice jumping off point into the more expository second sentence imo
what was his problem
lake poets being fags
  poetry didnt excite him as much as the threat of physical danger he couldnt into sublimation
im so bored xd

  this is the garbage that americans are reading  absolutely staggering

i vill steel all her wurds and make them my wurds in my bookthen ve shall see who is best first lady
based and deleuzepilled
  hehe my midwit garbage sells more so clearly its better    oh no
do you any of you actually like faulkner other than for his meme works
i never read a single page written by this guy is he good
  depends are you a yankee who passionately hates the south
  not even american
  then it might be difficult for you to understand or appreciate faulkner
  i dont hate it i dont hate it
  based and absalompilled
  not this his appeal is far greater than a fond recollection of the south
  but does he have much of an audience outside of america
  afaik he had a huge following in france for sanctuary and then the sound and the fury      i hope so hes undoubtedly the greatest author the 20th century nobody else has put out so many masterpieces of world literature
  he was more popular and appreciated in france and europe in general during his lifetime  in france i am the father of a literary movement in europe i am considered the best modern american and among the first of all writers in america in america i eke out a hacks motion pictures wages by winning second prize in a manufactured mystery story contest  t faulkner
      but what about the rest of europe what do the british think of faulkner
  who cares
  i just wish that america was more well known for its great authors than for being a cesspool of obesity race riots and ignorance
  absolutely death to all cousin fuckers
  t jealous yank who envies the fact that the great american author was southern
  corncobby chronicles  the great american author  kek
  pseud quotes nabokov thinks hes smart  many such cases
  american lit is t r a s h but the white people are fine you should probably move to israel
  caddy compson the light of my life and the fire of my loins my sin my soul  a moralist with a corn cob
  why wouldnt he thomas hardy is as rooted in the west country as faulkner is the south but i wouldnt expect that to be a barrier to entry for readers outside dorset    in britain hes probably considered the greatest 20th century us author you might get steinback or hemmingway if you talk to a pleb
  this  t brit
    lets be fair i think steinbeck is much more corncobcore than faulkner
    steinbeck isnt even a good writer let alone a good storyteller
  cant speak for europe but i remember reading about a czech who considers the sound and the fury the only beautiful book written in english he didnt like the english language
  the french love him  the translator did a good job
  hes awful go ahead and throw a fit i wont read your replies
  southern gothic  sutpen really got to me
so which one was better tsatf or absalom
  yes i like him  
  meme works  just what the fuck do you mean by that sir
  his most well known books i never see anything other than aild tsatf or absalom mentioned here when it comes to faulkner
  i have a copy of as i lay dying sitting somewhere i got for a buck should i read it
  yes it is very good friendo
  depends are you a trilingual russian expat and novelist
  get over it jesus the obsession with that mans quips pathetic
  clearly no one cares
  not everything is a meme dumb zoomer
  its joke
whats the oldest piece of literature youve ever read for me its the rape of the lock
your moms diary desu
  the gilgamesh epic  ancient people were seriously concerned about floods
  based
  impressively terrible post
  the kama sutra it has a lot of hilarious euphemisms about a deer woman thin vs an elephant woman thicc and putting your lingam in her yoni
  then youve read neither the essay on criticism nor messiah pity
  the holy bible and the gilgamesh epic
  not really its more a curiosity than anything unless you get an edition with photo illustrations obviously
the dogrug poster did nothing wrong i got a chuckle from that
  did he get modshoad
book of the dead or gilgamesch obviously
  so will modern people when the ocean starts to swallow whole cities
the iliad
the iliad
  did you know theres a theory that 12k years ago a comet hit the north american ice sheet immediately converting incredible amounts of ice to water which caused a 1000 foot high flood to pour down into the continent creating the modern scablands by cutting cubic miles of basalt out of the ground and depositing glacial boulders
  what happened
the fragments of heraclitus
  cute
pope bump
  mother of based
the iliad translated by alexander pope
  gilgamesh
  for ancient agricultural people whose lives were dictated by flooding yes it was a major concern for them
  what is book of the dead really about im curious cause im coptic and was thinking of reading it
  thanks

  i hadnt heard that but it sounds plausible
the song of deborah or the rig veda    the rig veda is probably nearly destroyed in translation but its still about as primordial and weird as text can be
  rk ved here too
  oh i should have mentioned that i have not read anything close to the entire rig veda maybe 50 lines at most i dont want to encourage pseuds on this board whose excellence depends on the honesty of its posters
  ive just read some of the ninth and tenth    flow soma flow
hairy pooper and the philanderers bone
  idk probably the upanishads
why read anything that came out before this
  global warming is a myth the exact opposite is happening the seas are freezing and the sea level will lower revealing atlantis thule etc
  the old testament spengler and yockey    
  i mean those pieces are relevant    the old testament if you count the fact it was oral tradition at first otherwise gilgamesh
  also this is also relevant but obviously much later  
  atlantis  thule  i dont dispute that global warming is a myth necessarily but climate change is not and is normal its pure hubris to think we can destroy the planetnature always finds a way  
iliad and odyssey
  the iliad i guess

  it was sheer genius
  not mutually exclusive
so i tried reading while listening to bach my god it elevates the reading to new heights ive never felt such bliss before unironically  do you guys listen to music as you read
this guy was pretty much a demigod
i cant do two things at the same time
i listen to tycho sometimes relaxing ambience ill try bach next time i read
  to me listening to bach is like trying to read an engaging book though or its at least as demanding in terms of attention i find the music distracts me from the book and then the book distracts me from the music
  it just distracts me and i end up paying attention to the music
if youre reading while listening to music youre doing neither
try these first 5 minutes 
    any sort of music that lets your mind flow i find is very useful for reading i wouldnt listen to something that demands your attention however but that should be given    any classical music works for me but my main ones are  rachmaninoff  beethoven  mozart  bach    also kind of ambient stuff like tycho or some more downtempo jazz type stuff works well
  how could one composer be so based
  rachplebinoff  scriabin is the patricians choice  
  im actually reading with bach playing right now and not even kidding im getting a little bit tearyeyed
  whatre you reading anon
  lies youre posting on lit right now
  not anything too highbrow i just started reading a book in moon and put bach on but somehow it all fit so well
  press play  volume at max  too late now  mfw my ears get blown out
  a book in moon you mean like in chinese or wha
  yes in jap
  dude thanks for this
  nigga last night i was reading war and peace while listening to 6ix9ine not even kidding
you really shouldnt do both at the same time it cheapens the experience listening to the music and reading simultaneously your attention cannot be focused on both fully   music like bach is meant to be appreciated with full attention doing something while listening to it relegates it to mere background noise  im not trying to say doing this is wrong or bad it just cheapens music by relegating it to a tool as a means to an end that is enhancing your enjoyment of literature/studying/what have you  i highly recommend taking time to appreciate and listen to the music on its own and with your full attenting and respect feel free to listen to it as pretty background noise however i think it is worth a listen on its own as well
  thats disgusting i hope that 69 faggot rots in jail
  oh i totally agree with this classical music and any other genres worthwhile should be experienced on their own as well i just have a hard time focusing sometimes and id much prefer to read with pleasant background noise rather than a constant ringing or people talking in other rooms
  it was really fun it was at the part where rostov returns home after serving in the military every nigga in moscow was hyped that he was back so it fitted the hyped up 6ix9ine music
  understood i often do the same thing if im reading something light or doing a chore i like putting on some of my favorites like air on the g or handels largo stuff that i know by heart that is carved into my unconscious at this point apparently it helps people to have pleasant background music to get them in the zone which i appreciate i just think music is valued more as a tool and commodity by many people which bothers me it certainly is in some ways however it has much more meaning than jus those aspects of it which you seem to realize
  this if youre looking to use music as background noise just use something like penderecki   
  do you guys listen to music as you read  no because most of the time im reading something new and id just find it distracting even if its classical it rarely fits the mood of what im reading at the time which just makes it worse and again i dont know what kind of music would be appropriate because its new material
youre not really listening to music youre hearing it in the background and its distracting you
  the duality of man
  thanks for the recs anon    based and wholesome
i hope all the naysayers in this thread hear this every time they attempt to read anything ever again forever  
i find music too distracting while reading but anyways fuck reading here is some good music i like and want to share with you guys      
      these two are my favorite pieces personally though im not all too experienced with classical hope you have a nice time anon
  3
  that was incredible thanks anon
lotta untrained brains in this thread you can convince your mind to do anything you want it to do that includes reading while listening to any kind of music it might take a little more time to complete the reading but you can definitely do it i do it all the time
  for me it was years of internet surfing while listening to music while not quite the same as serious works both visually and aurally it does serve to train a bit plus having a natural affinity to multitasking is really helpful
  the future is an ebook that track your eyes as you read and play a soundtrack that matches the oscillating intensity of the novel
  it may be because some here suggested overly complex songs to be listened while reading id find it impossible to read with most of bach songs but slow piano is usually helpful at combating my adhd
  i thought this thread was about reading sheet music disappointing
bach is overrated
  mozart was a devotee of cpe bach   bach ist der vater wir sind die buben
  jc bach also heavily influenced mozart having taught him for 5 months in london
it sounds like people doing this sort of thing are neither enjoying music nor their book but rather their own sense of exalted difference the self observing the self being the kind of person capable of knowing good music ans literature all at once    bach takes up all your attention as should any good book you cannot possibly enjoy anything but the most superficial aspects of one or both trying to do them at once
this fat ugly fuck is composing some of the greatest pieces of western classical music click here to find out how he did it
  i wouldnt listen to something that demands your attention  any classical music works for me  i doubt you actually appreciate classical but ok
god no   i couldnt do that
  is it just me or is this boring
  you should never listen to music while reading nor listen to good music while doing something else anon extremely low kind of proclivity to be subject to imagine having that little self control or ability to immerse in an aesthetic
  you cant consume two creative products of high level at the same time
  i dont only read while i listen to classical think of a venn diagram where reading books is one circle and listening to classical is another they overlap at times sorry for the confusion i have tinnitus and background noise really helps drown it out but id prefer the noise that i listen to to not be egregious
    that post was an accident  you might find this book interesting
    i like gregorian chants when i am reading makes me feel like a monk
  this i need to understand what im reading or what im listening to and i cant do both    though i did read proust while listening to satie but that seems so long ago
  absolutely not true you dont have to focus on the music  do you know mozart effect
what books/authors shoulder i read if i want to become very charismatic and be able to manipulate those around me

  nice joke bro
mfw realising that im going to be 28 in a week and ive only read 100 novels in my life  all that time i cant get it back
  anon i have read only a handful of books outside my university courses japanese literature and then i dropped out and played dota through my 20s i just started reading again in november you should be thankful that you actually read this much so far
  tfw read about 30  im 34
all that time wasted reading fiction    no you definitely cant get it back
  and played dota through my 20s  same worst thing i ever did in my life what the fuck
  what is the problem with that will you improve yourself just reading or what this isnt a race instead of worrying for the number of books you read enjoy the content of the few books you read and be sure to understand them properly
tfw im going to be 20 next year and i still havent got a wife a full time job or a university degree
  anime  yeah nah get bent
  wasting so much time reading fiction  might just as well kys now
  maybe you were reading short stories or poetry or dramas or learning about film or art music and i wouldnt say that time would be wasted
  im so glad i stopped playing videogames in uni
  dunno if bating for yous but uhh well firstly nobody has a uni degree at 20 and then you need one for a full time most of the times and a wife at 20 dawg thats early unless you really really found the one
  shut the fuck up
i read a novel once and felt like i lost 10 years of my life not a mistake im going to be making a second time
  the concept of the one doesnt actually exist its just an excuse unmarried people usually women use to excuse the fact that they are still single
  based and redpilled  i only read poems
  tfw im 27 and ive only read 1500 books  you will never read enough
  now why would someone lie on anonymous hentai craigslist bulletin
  my friends are 20 and have read less than 10 outside of education youre doing relatively well
  you need a document for thisvaganaismine in 2018 fucking dolt
  im 27 and ive forgotten the majority of things id read im gonna stop reading books desu
ive read like 50 books in my life 100 books aint bad whats more important is what you read rather than how much
you can easily manage 60 books a year for the next half a century dont stress
  the ones you forgot didnt really matter the ones you remember are worth rereading
  forgotten to what extent can you remember absolutely nothing from most of them or do some feelings remain sometimes a few scenes and feelings are enough to get out of a book long term
  few scenes and feelings  yeah this pretty much what it amounts to i dont remember names or anything specific just tone and a few images that id construed in my head
20 years old and just started my 6th book  it gets easier right guys

hey guys new to /lit/ and i was wondering what /lit/s opinion was about asking for people thoughts on their ideas for novels/graphic novels i wanted to ask for some feedback on an idea i had but i dont want to post it if its unwelcome here    im veering away from /a/ because i think itll be more written off as a meme as opposed to being critically thought of instead of just saying its shit lol  thanks
  i guarantee people will shit on it even if its good people will make fun of it if it really is good though you will probably get a couple of encouraging replies but they will be mixed with negative replies
post what you want feedback on expect something bad though
  im pretty new to novel writing and it was an inspiration based off how some characters like henchmen in big series only appear once or sort of act like a side kick    im working on a graphic fantasy novel that focuses on a blank canvas character style where the world sort of shapes his view   this story follows an undead skeleton named merlin after he was necromanced from the dead he finds himself confused and weary of his surroundings hes in the middle of aftermath battleground everyone is either dead or being dragged away he has no idea what his purpose is and cannot find the one who summoned him with out orders he seeks out his master to find a purpose in life    and so the adventure continues running into situations where he has to charade his intentions instead of speaking due to a lack of vocal chords
  he has no idea what his purpose is and cannot find the one who summoned him  this is the coolest part of your pitch because i want to know more its a common trope but its enough information that shows there is more information i dont know yet everything else just is battleground eh maybe a hint of something that it wasnt a usual battle like a battle ground but when we look closer both sides are dead the battle didnt even start everyone is just dead what how why something beyond just a battle
  i wanted to have the idea of late to the party where he was summoned a bit too late or that the spell of summoning was too long or that maybe there was a delay in the spell before being summoned    im not going to lie i did draw a little inspiration from goblin slayer and overlord but theres nothing taken directly from it    my friends the artist and im writing its more of a hobby than an actual book im writing up character concepts in a google doc as well as general story line before concreting the written words to know where im heading with the characters
  late to the party summoning  id read it will it be humorous or adventurous
  a combination of both  comic relief is needed
      you got me interested anon ill at least read the first chapter
  yeah id read it
    sounds interesting desu
  this sounds really interesting anon keep goin at it
    planescape torment  hai to gensou no grimgar  tsuki ga michibiku isekai douchuu  the one about the slime    it comes off as isekai of the coldopen type so youll need to either embrace that or investigate the genre to avoid making something derivative ill also add that what you took from overlord the goth vampires brainwashing arc is fairly obvious just so youre aware
  thats what i was thinking i was afraid of falling into that category but i wanted to try a more tolkein fantasy approach with out modern knowledge ill definitely be spending time researching it and ill post a link to the google doc tomorrow    sorry for the late reply

what is the point of books with words dont they say show dont tell when writing someone should teach these authors a thing or two about subtlety
  them words can beam right into your mind son
  dont they say show dont tell when writing  only idiots say that  show dont tell applies to visual mediums the advantage of literature is that youre allowed to tell
  its always been applied to literature first
  a film reel is just a piece of paper a director writes on
does any of you know of any books about social engineering frames subtext oratory etc   basically social skills but more advanced none of that dale carnegie crap this is a rather uncommon subject that is not widely discussed the art of subtle communication and seduction of people is yet to be explored by the average person it doesnt fit inside any category not even psychology
  anyone
not op just want to post prime brando
  nno homo right post more he is pic related because he knew how to project those subtle cues into the audience he was icnredibly autistic you know and despite that fact he was able to portray that alpha vibe flawlessly    
  you derailing my thread anon goddamn right you are
  maybe the art of deception by mitnick
  yeah but im not gonna share my knowledge with homos
  social skills  doesnt fit inside any category  not psychology  hearty kek anon thanks
  me  homo  pick one and only one
  i used the term social skills so it would be understood immediately but what im talking about is not about how the human psyche works rather how can it be worked around
mass psychology by freud and the work of his nephew edward bernays in america is the birth of social engineering havent read any of it but learned about it from adam curtis century of the self
  just share it anon i make you responsible for giving me the feels    tfw no pre feminism cutie pure aryan wife
  i gotta rewatch that shit thanks for the reminder
  robert cialdini
advanced social skills nlp then or ericksonian hypnosis nlp gets too technical and ridiculously autistic and ericksonian gets too esoteric at times theres no bridge for both to this day but both contain useful stuff to work people milton erickson worked for the cia for a while so you know his stuff was real deal
i just wanna be as charming and polite as this guy was  literally everyone who ever met him talks about how they were spellbound in his presence
   or you know basically anything by mitnick he was a legit hacker  but not in the way that most people imagine his primary strength was indeed social engineering i almost forgot  pic related is one of my favorites though only part of the text is social most of it is technical
  with nlp do you refer to neuro linguistic programming
  i will thanks for giving me a starting point
  would you like a basic gestalt
  yes    he was charismatic and talented an only charismatic with zero talent bowie would have been some low cost pimp or car seller
  but his talent only really manifested itself in the 70s if were being frank other decades he was seen as a complete joke and artistically bankrupt
  wasnt hitler the best at all this  firsthand accounts all say he was mesmerizing
  yes
  wasnt hitler the best at all this  i have yet to see anyone explore in detail the mechanics of what he was doing though  just the effects

  ill be waiting
  i found the constructive style of stealing the network to be most interesting ryan russel got several it pros and hackers together and tasked each of them with writing one chapter each of a fictional account that used a technical aspect with which they were personally competent as a plot device if you buy the complete edition then this is the first several chapters comprising the first book these chapters were all unrelated the first book being a financial success russel got a new crew for three more successive books along with one professional writer to help hone the product the three later books were all written to draw lines from all of the early chapters to each other while advancing the plot  resulting in a coherent conclusion russels final product is a fictional text generally constructed by nonprofessional writers with technical competence in electronics and social engineering it has a few rough spots no more than a typical pkd novel but overall it is both one of my favorite fictional texts and one of my favorite technical nonfiction texts at the same time many chapters have detailed instructions on how to accomplish the task at hand i spent the next year after reading this book inspired to resume tinkering with dos again  it was that compelling for me
  this is a rather uncommon subject that is not widely discussed the art of subtle communication and seduction of people is yet to be explored by the average person  which i find unusual here because we used to be known as the hacker known as 4chan growing on my suggestion of stealing the network and mitnicks works i also recommend the cyberthief and the samurai which is externally written about kevin mitnick also do not forget the other kevin from the time that these two insert noun here were at the top of their game    i have not read much of his work but what i have read was solid  from a tech geeks point of view
  im definetly going to read it

  finally i recommend listening to the work of these faggots    to see how they capitalize on misunderstanding beyond all of these i recommend actually engaging in the act yourself if you have time to discuss this then i have some experience i can share with some distillation of other peoples work or does practical application violate the spirit of the /lit/ board
  it is
  read ellul he sources his material well
  it really helped me seduce women and make friend/slave
  if you have time to discuss this then i have some experience i can share with some distillation of other peoples work    i would love it but im afraid i cant discuss something i know nothing about maybe if you dropped your thoughts in the air  no ones gonna judge on a france exporting chinese guillotine building manual factory forum so be my guest
    interesting please recommend a particular work
  so what you are either resented or a dumb autist yourself otherwise you wouldnt have bothered
  satan is shy  seriously listen to the jerky boys first because its an easy primer next advance to making cold calls to someone  it matters not whom it is call a department store and ask for detailed information about an item make them go in the warehouse and get a sample to be able to get the details for you call any repair shop or manufacturer and pretend to be a salesman in their field ask them what their concerns are this is where carnegie is legit if they have a real problem then they may want to talk your ear off thinking that you may have a solution   deposit one you for next installment
  haha what about getting yourself into places that you arent allowed in for example an office building or a private party
  propaganda the formation of mens attitude goes over social engineering but its a hefty read depthwise his works are vast so if you like that then youre set
  what about getting yourself into places that you arent allowed in for example an office building or a private party  do i not appear to be headed in that direction grow comfortable speaking with strangers keep actual notes on specific phraseology that they use especially if it gets repeated sometimes the key to the castle may simply be knowing the correct question to ask for instance mitnick used to call service operators and ask for specific codes by their proper terms the operators had no real suspicion that he was not a legit repairman because they never suspected anyone would  know the correct terminology  know how to get on the service operators line  know what to do with the information besides work on phone lines  i have no idea who you want to manipulate but i recc first that you become supremely comfortable with talking to strangers of all sorts before you make an attempt on where you want to exploit one error can spook a target for good you need to be confident and have technical savvy in the required field  whether that be interactions with a hotel staff or whatever if i wanted to manipulate someone at a hotel then i would want to understand every operation at the facility including vendors so i could find a point to exploit lets stay on track with your party situation so we do not veer into any black areas since this is all for practical jokes and entertainment purposes only i do not advocate the use of this for anything criminal shall i continue
nlp seems like complete pseudoscience selfhelp nonsense
  this is great info  what about convincing someone who has already been convinced otherwise
who are the bach/beethoven/mozart of literature
  the undeniable answer though pseuds will disagree is    bach shakespeare  mozart rimbaud   beethoven joyce
  can someone explain why these artists are so revered i feel like i am missing out on the deeper meaning when listening
  bach kant  mozart    beethoven hegel
  very simply put bach mastered counterpoint and the techniques involved with it mozart and beethoven innovated in/mastered the classical forms in such a way that it influenced the future of music greatly
  shakespeare dante john green
  listen with your brain not with your ears
  homer/dante/shakespeare    other runners up virgil cervantes milton tolstoy proust joyce
  in other words only the deaf can appreciate their works 
  classical music is so bad and boring and yeah you would have to be deaf to enjoy it
  listen to the 9th if you feel nothing theres nothing to be done
  bach  shakespeare  somehow i doubt youve experienced either of them if you think they are comparable artists
  this is the only good reply  i honestly cant imagine being in a state where i cant appreciate the 9th
shakespeare  mozart  goethe  bach  joyce  beethoven    mine is the best and most accurate
  this works without ulysses or fw considered
maybe dante for beethoven for semimad or passionate dudes whose shit was a bit over the top
  bach tolkien  beethoven cs lewis  mozart george rr martin
  switch goethe and shakespeare and you got it
serious question can any of them top this      its such a beautiful work of art perfect form of rap
  based  redpilled apart from sanderson instead of lewis
  this is the nub theyre great artists who also make sense in a development of artform way a lot of art music now tries to get away from their framework but its still massive    for literature in general theres no equivalent because theres not enough common ground in terms of technique and not so much science in the techniques development you could make a big three for the novel or the poetry or the theatre even then language barriers complicate things
  bach is literally the closest man ever got to being a god his mastery of music is unparalleled in music  all the keys and modes have their own character modulation is the switching from one key to the other bach would get lost in a whirlwind of modulation knowing each key so well that he would have perfect phrasing throughout he also mastered harmony listen to the little fugue to understand
  i would let the world die to preserve bach
  novel poetry and theater are analogue to orchestra music chamber music and opera youre right about the language barrier though the problem is that music cant be translated people who dont understand east asian music have to learn it to understand it then again maybe it would be best if didnt translate literature in the first place
    bach is anglo analytic philosophy mozart is anglo poetry beethoven is schopenhauer all of which are shit by the way
  weird im not seeing an argument
  bach is lessing mozart is schiller and beethoven is goethe soil your own composers with your poets anglofags
  you dont even speak french lmfao
  yes i do in fact i learned it at first to read rimbaud
itt    monolingual plebs deeming nonenglish speaking authors as great when they havent even read them in their original language    never gets old
  how far up my own ass do i have to be to get this joke
  fuck off kraut youre were only good for your music

    currently doing that now for the same reason how long did it take you how much better is it in french than english
bach dante  beethoven shakespeare  mozart virgil  palestrina homer
  bach cant be putted in the line of composers like glenn gould cant be putted in the line of bachs interpreters  mozart and beethoven from that point is just a brothers with nonsignificant personal achievements  i would say bach doesnt have a literature analogue meanwhile mozart and beethoven can be presented by any couple of writers
  
  based german poster
  so you agree none of these people were german are you a retarded we wuzz poster
  hegel  lmao kant wouldve autistically thrown out of his class if he had him for defending classical time stop pretending hegel made anything other than obscurantism
perhaps its kind of strange but  bach  shakespeare  mozart  mid/late goethe  beethoven  early/late goethe    these are the most analogous in terms of period it makes little sense to say that beethoven is joyce
  correct    palestrina homer  actually this    also  springsteen stephen king
watching /lit/ try to talk about music is hilarious
a couple posts above drew a line between early and late goethe i think it would be essential to distinguish late beethoven from earlier beethoven
homer virgil dante
  only music that can make me cry in whatever mood i am
  only someone from the modern nationstate of germany can be german  are you historically illiterate anon
  bach  mozart  beethoven
    not even this one        
  bach is literally the closest man ever got to being a god  pretty much this cant listen to jesu joy of mans desiring without feeling like my soul has been cleansed  
    thats very unfair
  beethovenbachschumannrachmaninovchopinbalakirevsibeliuslisztschubertdebussygriegravelmozart  mozart isnt even in the top ten
    thats also unfair mozart is one of the greatest
bachshakespeare  mozartshakespeare  beethovenshakespeare
  agree completely with bach/shakespeare dont know mozart/rimbaud well enough to agree or disagree but please justify your beethoven/joyce comparison beethoven was a prime example of the classical expression honed to a fine edge he was working in accordance with classicism and developing it  as i understand him joyce was a modernist whose appeal comes from deconstructing/reinterpreting the classics through a new lens    i quite like this one
  dumb romanticist putting sibelius on there is an insult to everyone everywhere all you care about is how music makes you feel
  just because rimbaud was also a young prodigy doesnt mean hes the equivilent of mozart hes more of a debussy    beethoven goethe  is the only fitting comparison i could really come up with i could see an argument for mozart/shakespeare too
  its not because they were prodigies nice redundancy with young prodigy by the way brainlet either extrapolate or keep your mouth shut
  cringe
  explain then because i cant see the similarity otherwise
    he was being gentle with your retarded opinion     mozart had not only a much more massive production than rimbaud but also composed in several different genres while rimbaud was restricted only to poetry although with variations of metric and also using prosepoetry    then theres the fact that mozart composed opera and showed a great capacity to understand the characters he needed to bring to life in music including women and their innermost passions desires and anxieties he had a talent for both the comic and the tragic    meanwhile rimbaud could hardly understand other people even in real life and his work is mostly surreal or concerning his own experiences and obsessions for him to compose a tragedy or a comedy in verse like shakespeare did it would be inconceivable because he had neither the gift for plotting and storytelling and much less the one to understand other people and bring characters to life     also mozart was much more influential in the field of music than rimbaud ever was in poetry you will find several musicians and composers stating that mozart was the greatest composer or all time or one of the greatest but hardly any poet that would put rimbaud above shakespeare or dante or homer in fact in the niche of lyric poetry emily dickinson is far superior to rimbaud    the real masterpiece of rimbaud was his life one of the boldest most wild and aggressive ever lived but as far as his art is concerned is a grave offense to consider him an equal to an artist such as mozart     to link joyce with beethoven is also offensive beethoven is a colossus far more productive influential ambitious and rigorous than joyce    you dont know nothing
  one day youll realize mozart is one of the greatest everyone i know thought mozart was trash at some point including me then you grow up
what are some good books on music theory i hate being a theorylet
  im the anon that replied to him thanks for bothering to explain so clearly how dumb his assertion was   i actually like rimbaud a lot at least as much as i can a poet in a language im still learning its still ridiculous to put him next to mozart
  20th century music theory is pure shit its the work of autists ew by the way theory by itself is completely useless if you cant audiate a v  i there is absolutely no point in learning about it
  not him but cant wait for the point when mozart clicks for me kinda new to classical in that ive mainly just listened to romantic music  some bach and some stravinsky amazing how much theres still left of the best that i havent even touched
    i tried to learn music theory without knowing how to play any instrument and its really hard i really think that for one to learn music properly is important to learn how to play an instrument and that takes a lot of time and effort so you will need to change your routine    if there is a book that helps one to learn music theory and sheet music reading without the need to actually know how to play any instrument then please tell me for i would love to know how understand whats going on my favorite compositions
milton is bach beethoven is shakespeare    dont like mozart    lofty thoughts bruh
  where is schubert tho
  you cant    why arent you learning an instrument though
  how much do you know i would just browse wikipedia/other websites for the very basics and then try and find books with a good reputation for specific points of interest  tfw i just ask my dad about things im curious about because hes very very well educated as far as classical music goes   very convenient tbqh
    listen to this symphonies in order    34  35  38  39  40  41    some of them that are not that well known 34353839 are wonderful play close attention to the openings of symphonies 38 and 39    listen to the best arias of the marriage of figaro like this one        or this from cosi fan tutte        and this opening from the magic flute    
  why arent you learning an instrument though    because i dont have time    at mornings i write verse plays and movie scripts    afternoons i work at a law firm    at night i am doing research for a masters degree in literature    on weekends i need to do research read and watch movies in order to get material for my plays and movie projects     not to mention that i dont have any musical talent
     if theres someone who owes it all to bach it surely is god  cioran

  bachshakespeare undispited goat  mozart pope possesed of extraordinary talent at a young age which was prodigiously displayed until the end of their lives  beethovenwordsworth innaugurated an epic of romanticism although musical romanticism and literary romanticism are difficult to liken
i love germany i love its people and its countryside and its music god bless you krautbros
  thanks screenshotted the post for future reference
where should i start with bach
  if you have to ask this question youre not ready to start with bach    bach is way too godly to be enjoyed yet alone understood by heathens you need to be classicaly trained in music and in music as in literature you have to start with the greeks
  i have a similar problem with not getting anyone other than mozart i think i might be autistic because something in my unconscious mind seems to interpret beethoven and other romantic and postromantic composers having more development in their music as arbitrary instead of development    somehow mozart seems like a holism to me and beethoven seems like look at these 80 sick riffs i can do in a row and then call it a narrative progression like its supposed to be set to visuals or to rely on visuals or imply visuals and is a lesser form of music than mozart    thats only my gut though i would like to get over this so i can appreciate music after mozart more
  glenn gould contrapunctus ix from art of fugue    the key to listening to bach is to understand some basic ideas of counterpoint which is basically interweveing lines of simultaneous melody as opposed to melody that unfolds over a chord based harmony      idiot
  for me its more just that romantic music appealed to me aesthetically  it just clicked naturally for me sounded beautiful the tunes got into my head and the more i listened the more i found in it  i think beethovens kreutzer sonata was the first piece of classical music i really got into  i generally pieces with fewer instruments like sonatas much easier than symphonies maybe because theres less going on      i was guided to the brandenberg concertos but personally it was a couple of his partitas that first clicked for me
  start with the brandenburg concertos no5 is my personal favourite especially the one conducted by karl richter     bach was the greatest composer to ever live no music will ever surpass it mankind will never see anyone as talented in counterpoint and modulation than js bach ever again
  can only really answer for beethoven the other two have decent works but none of them speak to me classical enthusiasm 101 you absolutely dont have to like all of it most of orchestral falls together and feels dull and not very unique    as to beethoven he said it himself at some point not gonna dig up the exact quote  his goal with music was to fill the mans heart with fire and the womans with love ill post some examples below if you wanna visualize it better type the names of the works in with smalin the guy illustrates music really well    fire   5th symphony 1st movement   moonlight sonata 3rd movement midi synthetic playthrough people play the difficult pieces so differently though i like valentina lisitsas renditions best as she can keep insane tempo   7th symphony 2nd movement   appassionata 3rd movement    love   6th symphony 1st movement ends at 1056   9th symphony 4th movement aka ode to joy be patient with this one rlly an experience to listen to    this split isnt really intuitive as all his works contain both especially ode to joy anyway thats why beethoven is legendary to me i feel his fire i feel something very profound from the way he composes fire just captures the intensity but it doesnt do justice to the powerful narrative it makes you think up on the spot especially 7th sym 2nd mov i associate with the masses suffering and persevering
    bach  cervantes  beethoven  goethe  mozart  joyce
  the welltempered clavier unsurpassed set of keyboard music of heavenly beauty i guess you wouldnt enjoy harpsichord so listen to the piano versions i prefer the second book because the minor pieces dont end with a picardy third
  the minor pieces dont end with a picardy third  thats the best part anon
ford  hemingway
  its a superfluous relic for me
  the more i listen to mozart the more i cant stand him
  dont worry mozarts legacy is mostly his contributions to musical form which by the way is enough to appreciate him but requires a liitle bit of study imho
  t desperate anglo subhuman
  bach/shakespeare  unless you think shakes is just known for his technical ability in poetry then this couldnt possibly be more retarded
who is the death grips of literature
  were comparing literature and music there are plenty of ways to go about it relax also i dont think anyone understands either bach or shakespeare as merely possessing technical ability both produced work that was so innovative it reset all notion of the limitations of human creativity
      bach homer  mozart shakespeare  beethoven cervantes
  how to get into bach
  listen to his music tbqhwy    look up bwv and then listen to some pieces from each bwv category eg his cantatas are between bwv 1 and 224 orchestral works between bwv 1041 and 1071 etc    this is my favourite violin concerto     heres a nice part of his st matthew passion bwv 244     works for lute bwv 9951000      heres a good cantata bwv 12 
  also this is an excellent harpsichord concerto bwv 1065     
  you can start anywhere really it doesnt matter this is one his best cantatas imo    
  for me its mozarts piano sonatas it seems like so many people like to write them off as throw away pieces he wrote in a hurry maybe this conceptions is backed up by history but i have no idea the fact is they are still great music his 8th sonata is amazing
  mozart is kant bach is leibniz peathoven is schopenhauer
  bach did a lot of stuff so find what you like and click around and look for his most performed stuff    1 he did 6 suites for cello solo that are so good and heavily performed listen to the prelude to suite no 1  2 jesu joy of mans desiring from cantata 147 is a piece from a chorale of his it is short and they sing in english   3 just look up bach air and you should find orchestral suite no 3 bwv 1068 2 air instantly
  youre right almost every romantic and modern composer is terrible the only exceptions are hardcore mozarteans like mendelssohn schönberg or stockhausen
  schönberg  schonberg is probably the worst thing to happen to classical music
  air is the single best solution to anxiety i have
  welp you picked my fav beethoven close but no beethoven never touched me like bach or mozart to me it feels more constructed by a human with expectations and assocations mozarts melodies feel so pure and bach is divine creation
  perfect showcase of a ye i listen to classical pleb not feeling mozart is the greatest filter also you are a piano fag arent you also ravel eeh
  debussy and chopin even being in the top 1000    fucking kill yourself you pleb holy shit
how do i into romantic/modern composers    all i seem to listen to is bach and mozart
  listen to beethovens sonatas  kreutzer moonlight and the tempest all come to mind moonlight sonata is more than just that one part that everyone knows btw last part is a banger  beethoven was a bridge between classical and romantic but i think those works are more romantic
  i like this one except i think milton is a better fit for beethoven since he lost his eyesight completely but never stopped writing
  ive been getting into tüür after coming across his gesualdo transcriptions for string orchestra  so i would recommend such transriptions/adaptations in general      
  joyce pynchon wallace
    not knowing the last monumental lateromantic piece  im really sorry for you
  bach  dostoevsky  beethoven  tolstoy  mozart  turgenev
  i might be in the minority but the 7th is his best work
  actually thinking this   if youre only considering anglo writing from a span of less than 100 years and discounting dfw maybe you could have an argument
    every time someone mentiones his symphonies hammerklavier gets one less view
  i dont care if he wrote a couple half way decent pieces his atonal bullshit was nothing but pure cancer thats better left in the dust bin of musical history    theres a very good reason why they average normalfag has never heard of him
  early schönberg is shit his greatest period was immediately upon the realization of his dodecaphonic system    that is because you subscribe to the false notion that the generative devices of a given piece is definitive while it is by far what is of least consequence
who is the elvis presley of literature who are thr beatles of literature
  dont care  his most important works sound like literal ear rape therefore he sucks
  i loved little fugue thanks for sharing
  whats wrong with early schoenberg he mastered form daily reminder he was first to strictly identify sentence theme and extended wagnerian harmony he was ahead of everyone
  he mastered form daily reminder he was first to strictly identify sentence theme  correct those are developments of the mature schönberg wagnerian harmonic devices are inherently without directionality and thus one must necessarily disintegrate the form
  kill yourself
  bach  dostoevsky    dont you dare ever compare bach to that hack ever again
bach homer  mozart shakespeare  beethoven goethe    extra  haydn dante  chopin byron  liszt proust  mahler joyce  skrjabin mallarme
  awful taste kill yourself
    listen to some of his straighfoward works on guitar or piano its like two notes and it sounds godly            also the chaccone takes a couple listens to get but you might as well do it now since its one of the most precious works of music ever written  
    pretty good
  oh shit i love arcanum and tes background noise
  ill answer your question with a question  what sorta music resonates with you
    i feel like im not really connecting/understanding the pieces am i just stupid or do i need to listen to them more
  its a fedora thing to say but they do click when you understand the melody
  dont worry about understanding them  just enjoy and appreciate them
  it is very obvious you have no idea what you are talking about if you say schönberg is following in mozarts footsteps the 12 tone series was a total departure from established musical tradition i came into this thread excited to find other people to discuss music with and now im disappointed because of   brainlets like you who just googled famous modern musicians to try and fit in
  check out brahms he was a romantic that limited himself severely with classical technique and as such is a bridge between the classical and romantic eras while his contemporaries were calling for off stage brass and choirs the craziest instrumentation he did was including a triangle in his 4th symphony
  not including mahler  opinion immediately discarded
  his 4th symphony    the second movement from this symphony is one of the most beautiful things i have ever encountered in my life        and also this song        i always brings tears to my eyes
  mahler sucks dick the main characteristic of his symphonies imo is disharmony he does nothing but try my patience every time he seems to start some melody that might be a decent theme for the whole piece he throws it out the window and changes the tune completely      he was ahead of everyone  in being a fucking pseud maybe
  this i love bach so fucking much
any of you heard bach by fernandez imo the best guitar rendition of his lute works by far    
reminder that bachs sons were amazing as well id even say jc bach can stand alongside beethoven in terms of genius    1 js bach  2 mozart  3 palestrina  4 j haydn  5 betthoven/jc bach
  oooh yes    cpe bach flute concerto in d minor 
it irks me so much to see people say this composer sucks dick this composer is awful you bunch of plebs that kind of elitism can only come from someone with entry level and middling taste of their own i am a music major surrounded by people who live and breath classical music they all have different tastes but not a single one is out there trashing composers i mean i have my own opinions but i wouldnt disparage anyone for or discourage them from liking certain eras or composers
  fuck off pleb
  i am a music major    lmao
  i know this is bait but the point is that no actual musicians that truly know music are so elitist and arrogant it could only be someone that has picked up listening to classical as a hobby/something to give them a sense of identity or superiority that would act like that
  theres literally nothing wrong with elitism
bach  aristotle   mozart  plato  beethoven  the stoics
  i know plenty of people who live and breath classical who disparage those they dont like on a daily    stop being such an elitist prick just because you have a few undergrad friends
    agreed but the people that act elitist about classical music are often exactly like the ones in this thread who clearly dont have any deep understanding of what they are talking about
  shitting on composers is fun fair enough but i havent seen a case of shitting on someone who likes said composers
  t mahler fan
  then i misunderstood your position forgive me i am tired
  dont like mahler dont like brahms not a fan of schubert
  anyone other than their favourite is garbage obviously
  most people arent music majors so they arent going to know much if anything about music theory or composition theres nothing wrong with that you dont need to be a music major to like or dislike classical music im  and i dont like mahlers or schonbergs music simply because ive tried listening to it before and i didnt like what i heard so im not entitled to my opinion that i think they suck just because i may not know as much as a music major
i think the issue with what the music guy said and what others replied is not being framed correctly it is not a matter of criticism is valid or not or you have to like everything it is a matter of do not rule out completely the works of an artist based on some fleeting sensation particularly directed at big name musicians kinda like what hegel said appreciate whats substancial do not make whats bad an essence of the totality unless you have understood it deeply
  no one says you have to like it but to write someone like schoenberg off as being a pseud while also admitting you lack the knowledge to make such an assertion makes you look like a dumbass your opinion is quite literally less correct than someone with deeper knowledge on the subject that being said this is an anonymous board for literature so i know you are having as much fun shitting on composers as i am on shitting on you which composers are your favorites
  to write someone like schoenberg off as being a pseud while also admitting you lack the knowledge to make such an assertion makes you look like a dumbass    pretty elitist bro
  i dont know about favorites but the ones i seem to enjoy the most are  beethoven  bach  rachmaninoff  tchaikovsky  rimskykorsakov  mozart  vivaldi  in no particular order
  rachmaninoff  tchaikovsky  rimskykorsakov  vivaldi    lmao
  sorry for your shit taste senpai
  indeed and my point is i have the background to be elitist whereas the people in this thread trying to be are embarrassing themselves with their shallow and misguided opinions  this guy  is very correct      nice rachmaninoff especially some of his earlier piano stuff i find enjoyable
  youre brain dead    u r a fag
  listening to poor recordings can ruin even the best compositions  seek out recordings from the 1960s and you can rarely go wrong    farts in zen
  mozart shakespeare  beethoven sophocles  this is based on the apollonian/dionysian dichotomy i have no equivalent for bach in lit
  absolutely juvenile analysis schönbergian dodecaphony was a reestablishment of 18th century formalism this is exactly why he felt the need to establish a system of tonality as logical and coherent as functions were for mozart the idea of schönberg the revolutionary is a lie with the exemption of his early mahlerian tendencies he was a reactionary through and through
  this is the dumbest fucking opinion ive ever had the displeasure of reading you think mozart was dionysian while beethoven stormy and turbulent beethoven was apollonian
  theyre both genuinely that good and already the famous ones while you could argue theyre the top 3 its self perpetuating at this point
  the exact opposite which i thought was crystal clear considering how i paired them  mozart and shakespeare are primary exponents of the apollonian tendency i think of words like delight brilliant perceiving at a distance  whereas beethoven and sophocles both give me the uttlerly dionysian sense of being forced to confront something
  no i didnt get that i can see where you meant that however my apologies
  no offense taken
  i have no equivalent for bach in lit  got it homer
  maybe the equivalent to bach could be goethe or milton

music is much more universal    all youre gonna get here is overrated english writers since people dont speak enough languages
  try this recording of mahler 1 boulez is much more restrained than other conductors which kinda sucks if you love the overthetop romanticism of mahler but it sounds like it may appeal to you this is the version i listened to when learning the piece because the orchestration is much more balanced than most recordings and i could easily follow different instruments compared to the mess that mahler symphonies can become under some conductors    
  redpill me on bruckner the finale of his symphonies or at least the ones ive listened to is always phenomenal but the preceding movements are all mediocre imo do you have a favorite recording i could listen to
  the holy spirit working in you
  nice list palestrina is not mentioned often and haydn is becoming more populair lately
  i agree with your analysis of early schoenberg although i would equate him more closely with wagner and i agree that he was establishing a new musical system however the fact that it is not based on the previous system at all means that he did not follow mozart we disagree because you think they are connected by the fact that they are both sets of rules but in my opinion the 12 tone series was a clean break from classical music entirely if the only thing two sets have in common is that they are both sets then there is no similarity in my mind but perhaps you see it differently
scriabin penderecki lutoslawski and messiaen also deserve a mention for being pretty /lit/
  the golden era of recordings was the 1980s as far as i know what conductors from the 60s are good and where can i find recordings
  the holy spirit working in you    cut the crap
  yeah i should listen to more brahms  i only know his hungarian dances from the civ iv soundtrack a piano quintet which i like a lot   any recommendations for his work with more romantic leanings preferably not symphonies
  celibidache he understands the transcendental goals of bruckners symphonic structures
  schoenberg needed rules to deviate from 12tone was initially the result of a search for guidelines that could solve the innate structural problems of free atonality
give me one1 good reason to listen to anyone other than bach and mozart
virgil/dante/shakespeare
  there really isnt one but ive come to accept that i am an occasional hedonic listener and thus have begun listening to inferior musics again
  i hate to say it but brahmss 1st and 4th symphonies are his best work imo and are necessary for understanding his work however they arent super long like some romantic symphonies so you can listen to them each in about 45 min i really like bernsteins slower tempo with brahms so i linked two of his recordings        
  thanks ill check them out  im actually sure ive given some bernstein brahms as a present to my dad at his request before actually  should make it easy to get a hold of the files
  mahlers second symphony the romantic era in general was much more interesting than the classical era in my opinion because the artificial limitations composers had placed upon themselves were being broken leading to some very interesting musical effects mahlers second represents the culmination of this era because of how many of these deviations from tradition offstage brass solo vocalists and full choir 5 movements etc he incorporates into the music    
  dont forget his requiem i almost peed myself the first time i played the second movementthere is no better crescendo in music
  correct by establishing a new set of rules that cleanly break from the previous established ones i argue that schoenberg is not following mozart at all but instead going in a totally new direction a simple analogy would be free atonality ended the romantic era and destroyed the musical cannon and the 12 tone series was a new beginning with the only connection being the instruments pieces were preformed with
  bach isnt a modal composer pal
  bach shakespeare transcendent genius  beethoven dostoevsky tragic hero  mozart goethe lighthearted prodigy
  not knowing that back did some weird shit with his cannons and actually has a modulation cannon            but in general you are correct and that guys a pseud a whirlwind of modulation like bach was the original prokofiev is the dumbest shit ive read today this board doesnt know shit about classical music despite how much some people pretend to
homer  shakespeare   dickens
    shits good man
  what does that even mean

              it sounds autistic as fuck though like a savant who is obsessed with numbers but has no comprehension of real human emotion    all youre feeling is what society is telling your tribal indoctrinated brain to feel it sounds complex so it must be good pretty pathetic and naive hero myth mentality but i guess this juvenile worship of an archetype is wired into your money brains
  i think you should read up on some beginners fishing manuals because you are absolute shit with bait
    he is right in a way today is has become fashionable to say bach was the greatest o all time and to trash beethoven many of those opinions are based on things those people read and on the current spiritofthetime     he is also correct when he states that a lot of people confuse the concept of complexity with that of beauty or greatness
    retards    le bach had no soul    is the most retarded trash ive heard    opinions are often based on popular opinion  got any other profound insights     honestly why cant every reddit poster just be castrated and shot already
  it sounds autistic as fuck though like a savant who is obsessed with numbers    if  doesnt move you im afraid you might be the autistic one desu
  fuck you too
  everyone on this board should take the time to listen to gould playing bach  
  yeah but bach along with other heavy hitters from the baroque period paved the way for every composer of the classical period and beyond without bach there would have been no mozart and thus no beethoven etc
  i unironically think bach is like hemingway there are moments in both which present themselves like catharsis through common sense which is reality rather than fantasy resolution through observation rather than action   i realise hem wasnt the greatest writer ever to live but thats the noblest effort i can make at this hour
  you do know that bach literally had no impact during his time or when mozart was already great right     there would absolutely be a mozart and even a beethoven who wouldnt waste his time with fugues
    i bet this one is a christ fag
i just bought this and im wondering how good it is i am a computer science guy who likes math so i feel ill probably enjoy it

  literally unironically who
  the colonised wench looked towards the garden gate where the tall anglo entered wearing his white linnen suit gin and tonic in one hand and a whip in the other the sight of which made a curcumic seepage swell from her furry curry pungent and peppery with pajeetian purpose
  a fairskinned indian probably of the higher castes with a tooperfect bindi on her brow
  seems like a sweet girl why did you choose her and this image op
i decided a cup of darjeeling tea would be an appropriate send off an ambiance we never shared till now my nostalgia her melancholy she knew it was her last moments i saw her last sip travel down her troat i smiled slowly and stood up my revolver was out under the table the whole time she knew since she felt something next to my cock i raised the gun at her head the scope laser now right between her eyes for england james she said no for india jameela i answered cuck she murmured i smirked any last words roastie yes wh paahh i clicked too soon intentionally of course my favorite thing in life is an incomplete conversation it validates a reason to rekindle i knew i would see here again we were head to the same place her spot perhaps maybe a bit hotter than mine but the way im headed so will mine     
an infrared dot hovers over her glabellar notch i exhale then squeeze the trigger
  why why must you torment me so with these jezebels my one single wish is to be left to my own asexual devices free from the thorned grip of perverse tempation unclouded or swayed in my noble search for intellectual playthings of the mind yet by your hand i am endlessly titillated by these vixens with their prodigious hips and provocative figures can i never satiate this thirst will i ever know the touch of a woman and enter between her loins will these hands ever feel a womans swaying weight in their open palms will i ever know a plump ruby pair of lips perched betwixt my shoulder and my ear whispering i want you i want you now in that chocolatey croon i know so well from dreamtime will my seed ever drip from her moistened hole indicating the completed unity of our unhinged sexual impulses    life is a constant hell day in and out the tired red eyes glaze in some attempt to shield me from these images i am floating in the blistering heat of my ids vacuum castrated and blinded by my wretched libido no wonder i resent women so
  innocence grace beauty all gone in an instant when the assasin pulls the trigger  a bullet zaps her right between the eyes he has only minutes now to make it to his escape ride
bleached rupi kaur but with intact chromosomes  and enough of them
  what seemed to be one of them curry nigger dots between her spic eyes was actually a bullet hole she was frozen for a moment with a smile on her face before she collapsed long enough for big jim to notice her overlapping teeth     not much of a waste he thought as he spit in the dirt and called for his horse with a quick whistle one less swarthy senorita in these border lands her belly full of baby bandidos chocking on stale blood now that her heart was no longer pumping he holstered his colt mounted his horse and rode off with the amount of tortillas he scavenged from these beaners he could keep up this patrol almost indefinitely hopefully long enough to cleanse the state
  her starry eyes were frozen in time the screen flickered but her cold gaze did not shift a pixel her warmth could not reach me my pupils focused unmoving a tear trickled down my cheek
a pretty girl indian dressed in traditional robes her smile communicates a certain plastic joy most likely posed for the purpose of a good facebook profile picture shes generically handsome and from this image theres not much i can nitpick about her appearance despite this fact i cant help but feel like shed possess some type of curryinduced bad breath that would overpower the perfume she bought from neiman marcus weve all met somebody like this girl     simply said if you took your runofthemill socal barista and threw on her some traditional hindu looking garments youd have a close to exact carbon copy of who im describing    thoughts critiques

  a certain x  some type of y  im sorry but youre gonna have to neck yourself    now thats good prose
   my revolver was out under the table the whole time she knew since she felt something next to my cock  you fucked up here   cuck for no reason  you fucked up here    otherwise good job anon    didnt see it but wouldnt have laughed had i known it does seem like theyre just being fags and not actually so cynical as to copy a post a few above theirs unless this place really is now nigger land reddit
  unable to poo in the loo
  yea thats mine lol her calling me a cuck has to do with both work and our relationship history but thats besides the point mate you said good job but didnt laugh which is it
  hes an indian who went to the british side if that helps
  theres an occulted history  ah my mistake for being so ready to jump on you something about good writing with mutilating flaws enrages me more than pretentious or midwit prose thanks for sharing your talents with us beloved anon no i did not laugh its very difficult to make me laugh however i have seratonin dysfunction and am in a perpetually hyper or hypodopaminergic state with heavy flat affect so you should not take it to heart fren
  yeah that seems obvious from the flemingesque quip or whatever youre referencing excuse the ignorance still didnt like the obscenity and disjointed spatialtemporal description but thats just my taste though you could have done better there

  already did those phrases are pure bloat take  her smile communicates a certain plastic joy most likely posed for the purpose of a good facebook profile picture  and rewrite it like so  her smile communicates a plastic joy posed for the purpose of a good profile picture  which isnt how i would write it but is better imo  take again  despite this fact i cant help but feel like shed possess some type of curryinduced bad breath  and all you need to keep is  despite this i feel like shed possess curryinduced bad breath  which again id simplify even further if it were me to  but i still feel like shed have bad curry breath  but again thats just me see how much bloat was in your sentence
is that a bullseye for dudes to aim their cum at ahahah
  why did i kek
  because shes possibly the most beautiful sight my eyes have met
          shes not indian shes a bangladeshi
shes an utterly perfect being of light she laughs at all my jokes and i laugh at hers we have all the same hobbies the same taste in food the same taste in music and movies we like to play the same games we travel and see the world together our proposal and marriage was like something out of a storybook and our children are perfect just like her our life together is a dream but first i have to work up the courage to speak to her
im looking into getting into contemporary lit is this a good place to start i may even gift it to my teenage stepsister for xmas

  rude      my step sis is only about 16 or so so thats why i thought getting her ya would be a good idea im not sure what her reading level is i thought itd be safer getting something rather new than say john green because she is less likely to have it gifted to her before
is this any better anyone read this
  if you want to buy a book for a younger loved one read it yourself first then you can bond about the book later and you wont have to worry about taking someones word for it and planting bad seeds instead

  actually some anon was posting excerpts from this book last week and some of the prose was surprisingly good of course its got a ya africanamerican urban youth focus to it so the prose uses a lot of colloquial turns of phrase but it had a good sense of rhythm and felt very accurate as to how kids speak nowadays    i was curious enough that im thinking of picking up a copy for myself although im sure the book would resonate more with me if i was a gen z kid or black but its tackling a topical subject in a relatably youthful way probably a good way for young kids to get into reading
  stunning john green
what does /lit/ do to get comfy while reading i prefer slowly smoking a cigarette and hot cinnamon tea in hand with a heater next to me
very comfy op my cig breaks are for shitposting so i dont usually smoke and read i prefer coffee a sweatshirt and thicc socks sometimes some tycho on in the background
  this to a tee
  i put myself under a huge pile of blankets and read on my kindle with my head on the pillow  i can read like this for 5 hours straight
  thats cute as fuck
  i lay back on my pack in my sleeping bag with my little dog curled up on my feet and turn the red light of my headlamp on and every now and then smoke a hand rolled cigarette
i read every day on a dilapidated new england regional train surrounded by angry strangers
  brother
ill go outside to my tool shed light my wood stove if its cold smoke my pipe tobacco and read my dogs are out there with me unless theyd rather be inside with my mom    good times
  literally me desu
pajama pants warm drink tea coffee chocolate and under a blanket on the bed  minus the blanket if i want to smoke thats comfy too
  that sounds cozy    based    also based
i smoke a pipe whilst i read   i like a small bowled savinelli filled with with a highstrength lightly topped kendal blend and to sip on it whilst i melt into my reading chair in a nicotine induced coma     cant wait till i can grow a beard
  looks comfy anon cute dog too
  seeing that picture makes me want to give you a hug and take you and your dog on a hike
  based comfy anon  dog
  curl up with a blanket on the sofa a cup of tea on the table lit by nothing but a small lamp beside me and some quiet drones to set the mood    
outside in the shade of a tree maybe next to a river or something
  i like to go to crowded bars and sit some place very prominent and take out some light reading like wittgenstein or hegel and start reading while keeping my ears open for the sound of cunnies moistening in awe
  you look homeless
  i dont like nicotine  do you know any good herbal blends that doesnt kill you
i would read on the couch next to my computer so i could listen to music but my very old cat insists he sit there
  in the colder months i usually put on the water on to boil for my chamomile or jasmine tea depending on the time of day make sure the fireplace is well stocked put in earplugs or earmuffs if there are people bumbling about or if theres a tv or smartphone making irritating noises click on my reading lamp next to my chair thats in the corner next to the fireplace sometimes ill sit with my familys old timer toy poodle whos blind and deaf shes really mellow these days  during the summer i sit on the deck in my outdoor chair in the shade with cucumber or lemon water sometimes ill wear earplugs outside too because of neighbors using lawnmowers or other annoying equipment  i biggest wish in life is to one day have a cabin to myself where i can read in silence without distraction or disturbance  during any time of the year ill likely be rereading lotr usually the fellowship in bed before turning down the chain lights i have strung up around my headboard im more grateful for that book than any other
vape
it depends on the time of year in summer i put on my sunglasses wear a light tshirt and shorts and remain barefoot then take a seat in the shade outside my back door pour a cold pint of ale and chain smoke i rarely read in public in winter as it is currently i wear my sweat shirt and over the top a thick woollen jumper that i only wear inside the confines of my flat i also wear comfy trackies and a pair of my thick woollen socks this is usually on my settee with my feet up i generally drink tea and eat chocolate and since i dont smoke inside i go out back for a ciggie every few chapters which helps give my eyes a break and gives me time for a breather late at night or early in the morning ill read wrapped up in my duvet in bed typically nude underneath the blankets but sometimes ill leave my socks on in spring and autumn it depends on the weather on the day and includes variations of the above
  based    comfy whats your pups name
  i biggest wish in life is to one day have a cabin to myself where i can read in silence without distraction or disturbance  that sounds ideal would you have a cabin in the woods or on a hillside my uncle has a cottage in rural brittany which a small acreage that is perfect but i doubt i will be able to afford one so unless i inherit his im thinking a cabin in the lake district i can use as a retreat for reading and writing
i go to a baskinrobbins in town after delivery runs and make conversation with the cute girl who works there in between her customers or i read at home at my desk while taking notes if im reading a novel im usually tucked under a weighted blanket with some chamomile tea
i read early mornings on my long commute to work on the bus next to a heat vent and a window with my legs slightly propped on the outer covering of the back wheel and listening to white noise or light classical   i also read late at night with a weak lamp a cheap candle and some tea in my room before bed both are equally comfy for me
  smoking inside  the fuck im a vapefag now but when i smoked it was always a time for comfy ass walks
  people used to smoke everywhere
  its not the nicotine that kills u but the smoking itself smoking anything is bad for ur lungs if u get dried tabacco its safer than cigs tho
  ew
  smoking tobacco is harmless read whitby
    the smoking scare debunked      smoking is good for you  
  i read on my laptop while shitposting constantly switching between tabs
i like to put on this aran cardigan i got from ireland underneath can be whatever but peak comfiness is with another sweater underneath i put on the moc slippers my parents got me for christmas a few years back and sit by the window and watch the snow fall late at night its just really quiet and serene and the snow falls so gently hell sometimes i never actually open the book i just look at the snow and think and dream and smile
  absinthe and baudelaire what i did tonight im done reading but i keep on drinking its groovy
i make myself a hot lemon juice and tuck myself into bed
  drinkers of hard liquors tend to be more respectable than beer imbibers beer drinkers almost always go after hedonistic pursuits like getting laid hooliganry or even just jacking off and watching richard mortimor while home alone downing a sixpack pathetic creatures the male whiskey absinthe or gin and tonic etc fan/tippler on the contrary as a general rule but certainly not always is found in more mentally demanding work often immersed in work or study
  this is a good way to pick out whether or not someone is a good friend too go for a lunch or drink after you meet them     top tier  non drinker  great tier  whiskey/hard alcohol drinker  shit tier  beer drinker  low iq and cringe tier  forcibly guzzles beer as quickly as possible and moves on to the next immediately
  nigger
  am i shit tier if i drink cider
 trying to quit smoking   3 days smoke free   worst headache insomnia and irritability i ever had   want to browse comfy /lit/   literally every poster in the /comfylit/ thread is smoking something    is this a sign i should give up and go back to smoking
  tycho yuck
  anyone just drops somewhere on the floor with thiccky socks and uncomfortably roll around every once in a while but it doesnt matter cause im absorbed anyway
  smoke a joint rest my head on a pair of boobs/a stomach and pull over myself a cashmere blanket and a cool drink close by
  weed      nicotine combined with the irritation caused by smoke is exponentially more carcinogenic than just smoking random plant matterof course large tobacco companies dont want to acknowledge this
absorb massive bong hits to the face and ingest industrial quantities of low quality foodstuffs

  ive seen a lot of people call the plague boring but its my favourite book of his rieux tarrou grand  they all have a distinct sense of duty which is something that very much appeals to me    ywn have a friend like jean tarrou 
we really need to start enforcing underage b again
  he shot him because see pic related
    the atmosphere in that book is underrated  dead rats crowding the streets  revolver gunshots ringing out in the dead of night as cops execute stray cats and dogs  the reporter listening to the same st james infirmary record over and over in his hotel  the graphic portrayal of the kid dying towards the end  the sermons  the existential dread these images evoke are what makes it such a classic to me i wish camus had been alive longer to write more imaginative settings like this its just as good as the best science fiction historical fiction and horror the stranger and the fall by contrast feel very much like real life
though not his best and not finished i really liked the first man
whats a good nonfiction book about degeneracy drug abuse etc from the authors perspective

  shadrach in the furnace by robert silverberg
has anyone else read this god forsaken trash this is like reading a story posted on a fanfiction website the vampires basically act like girls constantly bickering at each other id go as far as to say none of the characters in this book so far act like men even though they are anne rice is a hack
  i have read this book and i enjoyed it thoroughly
signing off with thanks to all who have participated in our discussions of fiction writing today i want to leave you with this thought i think we are facing a new era of censorship in the name of political correctness there are forces at work in the book world that want to control fiction writing in terms of who has a right to write about what some even advocate the out and out censorship of older works using words we now deem wholly unacceptable some are critical of novels involving rape some argue that white novelists have no right to write about people of color and christians should not write novels involving jews or topics involving jews i think all this is dangerous i think we have to stand up for the freedom of fiction writers to write what they want to write no matter how offensive it might be to some one else we must stand up for fiction as a place where transgressive behavior and ideas can be explored we must stand up for freedom in the arts i think we have to be willing to stand up for the despised it is always a matter of personal choice whether one buys or reads a book no one can make you do it but internet campaigns to destroy authors accused of inappropriate subject matter or attitudes are dangerous to us all thats my take on it ignore what you find offensive or talk about it in a substantive way but dont set out to censor it or destroy the career of the offending author comments welcome i will see you tomorrow   anne rice 2015
do you put on background music when you read or do you find it distracting and prefer silence  i think drone is a decent middle ground it fills the silence and sets an atmosphere but is usually nonintrusive whats your goto reading music
  whats your goto reading music  either the sound of water from my pond or silence

  its a retelling of ulysses
  its a critique of marxist historical materialism
  how its just some neet kid with cuck parents
its a parody of emil cioran
its an allegory for the effects of language contact with persian in modern armenian
  its a response to descartes demon
  read it again with your new knowledge itll become apparent youve read ulysses right
its a response to the letters of william gaddis
  couldnt even come up with an original title
  havent gotten around to it
  reminds me of neuromancer by william gibson
  based
    not every book with an autistic main character is a retelling of ulysses
  basically any time anyone goes on a journey its totally a ulysses reference look through the cliffnotes at least if you want to stay on par with the luminaries of /lit/
  you should read the name of the rose by humbert eco and borgess death and the compass probably faulkners the sound and the fury as well  after perusing these texts the nihilism oh tciotditn will become more readily apparent
  he isnt autistic
its a satire of antony beevors seminal history of the second world war
its a dedication to the influence of siegfried sassoons poetry on the author
  maybe not consciously
  sauce
  it was autism
  when did they say he was autistic i thought he was just stupid
  show dont tell
  not explicitly stated in the book but i recall he mentioned that he modeled christopher after an asperger he met when he had a job at autism speaks in an interview once dont have the source to confirm this though
    the author barely did any research into autism anyway he said he spent more time researching the trainlines than he did autism and thinks its strange people hold up his book as a symbol of good autistic main characters
  as an autistic person i can relate to this the protagonist barely even sounds autistic
how much is too much to spend on a single book
anything
70 usd
  why are all textbooks so expensive and who buys them there are fucking 200 pages textbook for 90
  depends
more than 30 usd    but also       literal and figurative jews people who dont know what the internet is beyond social media
80
  30 bucks
15 usd
i once spent over 90 on a 300 page academic work that was too much
0 usd  books are free these days
  this is a creative fiction board you know perhaps youd better run along
  creative fiction is free
  who is going to produce creative fiction if there is no reward for doing so
  12175367
  i am
  there are rewards for doing so
  same i spent like 75 on a book on shinto a really nice hardcover but man that was expensive    also i fucking hate how certain kindle books still cost like 80 of the physical price publishers are assholes
  yeah a lot of money if youre worth it even harold bloom writes for money and his message about the preservation of aestheticism is one he passionately believes in
    money is the only reward you can conceive of  cucked by capitalism
  depends on the book if its out of print a reseller can charge anything
  20 unless its hardcover 15 is the most ill pay for paperback
most ive spent is 90 on a rare and out of print book i could probably sell it for the same if i wanted to
  thirty dollars
5  you can get all of nietzsches platos st augustines tolstoy aristotles and the bible for less than that
  enjoy garbage quality and translations
depends on the book but usually around 2025 for paperback and 35 for hardcover  and yes books are fucking expensive here but i dont mind paying up because they make me happy
  who cares about that when you can have the most aesthetic covers
  ok now this is based and red pilled
in an antique bookshop in my city you can get books for around 7 euros if i can not get my books in these shops i buy them online for like 10 euros
  1 cent  why buy when you can read at the library or pirate online
how do i stop subvocalising

why do people pretend hannah arendt was left wing when she made the strongest case for classism since de maistre
  because nazis bad and heidegger nazi bad cuz not say sorry and israel best
  what
  han on good guy team of nazi bad and heidegger nazi bad for not say sorry and israel good     so    now on good guy side of nazis bad and is same side bad right     so    left
  truly
  the quality of posts is extremely important to this community contributors are encouraged to provide highquality images and informative comments
reading anything a woman wrote  cringe
    fine my admittedly underdeveloped suspicion is that she is miscategorized as a left wing thinker simply because she stood firmly against the ultimate enemy of leftism fascism in general and the regime of nazi germany in particular this is supposed to be evident in her analyses of and comments on the nazi regime her books about nazi war criminals and her chagrin at finding her former teacher mentor and lover martin heidegger a former member of the nsdp unrepentant for his nazism even many years after the war its a the enemy of my enemy is automatically my friend sort of situation
  i liked it better the first time
  which book is that ive been meaning to get to her and ive got the human condition somewhere here 
  among other reasons because she was very critical of capitalism
  unrepentant for his nazism even many years after the war  patently false
  he called it a blunder he never apologized
maybe because she was a socialist im not sure
if the jews would have been discriminated and hated everywhere it would mean hating jews is the most natural thing  more like hannah raimi am i right
  she took pride in never having been a socialist
  she was deeply critical of the state of israel to the point that eichmann in jerusalem was banned for many years and remained untranslated to hebrew til recently    ever read her work    i doubt it
ive wondered the same thing op it is probably like this anon says  though i dont see her making a strong case for classes exactly more just for the liberaldemocratic project in general in which classes are basically just an abstraction of personal wealth and access and the health of the society is measured by either percieved or real mobility into wealth and access
i never read her because she looks insufferable in this picture
  i guess you dont have a good conscience then arendt is both smart and nice
hi anons as we move into the christmas season i like to give a little back to the /lit/ community such as it is by buying a few anons a book or two in return for all the conversation weve enjoyed over the past year last year i bought 3 or 4 anons a book off of their wish lists and would like to do the same this year as well    if youre interested in a gift this christmas season post a link to your amazon wish list here i have 100 give or take to spend on buying yall a book from your lists so if theres something youve had your eye on but havent ordered yet feel free to post here and ill see what i can do as i said last year please no prohibitively expensive requests the example of what not to ask for last year was women and men same basically holds true this year i would like to spread the gifts around as opposed to buying a book for just one anon     up until the 100 is spent its basically first come first serve off of amazon wish lists easiest for me to fulfill while still allowing you all to retain some anonymity    please also refrain from explicitly racial/controversial requests as my anonymity isnt retained when i buy you books and id prefer to avoid buying copies of mein kampf     hope everyone is having a happy holiday season so far merry christmas anons
how are these lists anonymous if it has our name attached to it regardless i dont care if i get doxed or whatever because i have nothing to hide     this is a fun idea merry christmas everyone should post their wish lists and i will try to buy some books for anons as well maybe we can make a thing out of it buying gifts for each other here is mine 
  you can set your list up to not show your full name if you want    also ready to order you some dostoevsky but it doesnt look like you have your list set up to let me ship to your address anon i can only choose my own shipping addresses let me know if you update your list/shipping options
  happy christmas  yall   i suppose you say don quickoats too merry christmas is the proper seasonal salutations not happy christmas a birthday is deserving of a happy but christmas is not a mere occasion that can fall on any and everyday depending on the individual but one day and one day only and as such mandates a more dignified noble more intelligent word
    see attached image for where you go to set a delivery address for a wish list    don quicksott actually and looks like youll be getting some coal in your stocking come christmas morn anon
  ah i see i dont normally keep a wish list i just set one up now the address should be set now
  no worries anon your gift should get there sometime next week hope you enjoy it
i think this is pretty interesting actually no need to buy me anything but if someone does ill try to pay the favor forward    
  much appreciated generous anon
  one terrifically good epic of italian poetry is on its way to you anon a very merry christmas to you
its my birthday coming up soonish so it would be really nice to get something ill make sure to gift some people as well if you do choose to give me anything im pretty new to literature in general so the list is stuff ive found interesting but not been able to find at local book stores and the like thank you again 
  aw thank you i wasnt actually expecting it haha to keep my promise ill buy  a book this friday ill keep your list bookmarked buddy
  ah thank you too then i dunno how amazon works can we buy people used books i wouldnt mind mine being used in most cases
  a series of semifantastical vignettes is on its way enjoy and happy holidays
  i think its just whatever copy the lists owner marked down on the list as in if i marked a penguin classic edition of ecce homo the only copy people would be able to gift would be the penguin classic edition im not entirely sure but thats the gist that im understanding
  very kind of you anon not to take anything away from   but last year this thread was oversubscribed so you might want to check back once ive tapped out to see of anyone else hasnt gotten a gift off of their lists but up to you generosity in any form is still a good thing
  argh typos should read    to see if anyone else
  i agree but i already made the promise to him haha however ill try to cover a few different people myself unfortunately im working off of a limited budget so i can only get to so many but hey its the holidays might as well give what i can
  thanks anon
    to answer my own question for those who dont know yes you can buy used copies of that version of the book    i guess it would be good to specify if youre ok with used or not
  excited to gift some philosophy but you need to edit your list to let me ship to your address anon see  
  well that answers that i agree it would be good to clarify    perhaps a small set of rules/reminders for other anons to follow would be useful  specify whether or not youre fine with used  make sure your list settings allow you to be shipped to  not mandatory but do try to pay the favor forward    something like that
my address should be there now and im fine with used books i really appreciate it
  
  that would be nice but i think the point of the thread was not for all of us to give things but rather him to give to us     but still i think it would help him save some money and give more gifts to more people if hes buying new copies for us since it wouldnt matter to me either way i havent looked at what he got me since i left my thing on surprise or whatever
  haha my bad my bad id still like to give out to people all the same even if he stops plus i think its great to encourage people to do the same though i dont intend to force it on people
  a gift is on its way anon hope you enjoy working your way through it the effort it takes will be rewarded im sure      if anyone wants to pay it forward please feel free to do so in whatever way you please just trying to spread a little holiday cheer and good will among my fellow anons    i have budget left for one more anon before im tapped out and will leave the rest to you all thanks to everyone in the thread it makes me happy to be able to give back in this small way
  interesting sadly i cant buy anything for myself this christmas because im moving out to tokyo and i wont work for at least 3 months and i already hired a lawyer so have to pay him id rather have a professional handling the paperwork required for the visa than doing it myself  i have a decent reading backlog but id love to buy these books ill do it sooner or later  registry/wishlist/23mhe58yv3td0/refcm_sw_em_r_mt_awwl_s_b8hbcbaqdprdb
  need to set up your list to allow shipping to your address anon
  sorry first time using the wish list thing did i fix it
  no worries anon yes you fixed it and a gift is on its way    and thats it for me fellow anons hope that you all have a very merry christmas and very happy holidays
  merry christmas dad thanks for the presents  _  my only regret in life is not being able to give you anything
  youre welcome anon and please no regrets for all its faults ive gotten an awful amount of both entertainment and education from /lit/ which wouldnt be possible without all you fellow anons 
  based anon ill balance the universe by giving away some of the books i dont need anymore
  mistypings continue  an awful amount of  should be  an awful lot of
would you consider pic related as a book i can log on goodreads yearly challenge i am not counting longer poems such as rime goblin market and the waste land but thought this might be an exception
    booooooooooooooooooooooomb squuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuaaaaaaaaaaaaaaadddddd
  no its rather short also goblin market only takes a few minutes to read etc  lucrece is a great poem though  on the other hand the summer library book challenge for elementary schoolers in my neighborhood accepts picture books in their annual contest that only takes my 5 yr old niece a few minutes to read so if the goodreads thing is at all like that then go for it are prizes involved my niece won an operation game for her efforts
what is majoring in literature or humanities like i wanted to do it but i thought there was no money in it so i went for a stem degree instead the irony is i flunked out with lots of student loan debt so im wondering what i missed out on i kind of wish i had gone for the lit degree now

a hot load of leftist bullshit if you say anything that goes against the narrative ten people will start arguing with you and will all pat each other on the back  here is the reading list from a class i took entitled principles of literature study  alison bechdel fun home  earl lovelace the dragon cant dance  kei miller fear of stones and other stories  toni morrison beloved  virginia woolf to the lighthouse  i now no longer take literature classes and just read books i want to read

you should do what you like so that you can be successful at it
  pretty much me desu havent dropped out yet of my physics major but god i hate it
tfw not sure if low iq or just underachieving because i literally study like 12 hours a year
  definitely low iq otherwise youd want to study
  this post is a hot load of bullshit or american colleges really are shit here in the continent they want us to ask questions
  same im from ireland and they actively encourage us to create our own original interpretations of texts
  its the same thing
  brainlet
  physics major  op here thats what i was too
      same humanities in germany are really good asking questions is demanded and going against the common narrative is encouraged
    what university i studied literature in ireland too and while you were encouraged to interpret texts in your own way the reading list and beliefs of the lecturers pretty heavily influenced acceptable discussion about interpretation plus 90 of the class was always girls who wanted to talk about gender regardless of the text
  how far did you get and why did you stop
what if i have an equal interest in mathematics and humanities how the fuck can i reconcile both  major in one and study the other on your own  something tells me this isnt really possible since almost everyone who claims to be 100 self taught turns out to be a massive hack
  american colleges are really shit    punch your ticket so youre not left to rot in lowermiddle class obscurity bang some qts take advantage of the library card and gtfo
  good album
  i suspect there is also a strong element of some contrarian point shortcircuiting a discussion    senior level philosophy seminars/tutorials were a lot better and more productive because most people are out of the i have an opinion stage of discourse that turned every open discussion into a shitfight
i majored in humanities had a great time and got fantastic grades and now im a well compensated tradesperson in a field unrelated to my education with no student debt because my parents just wanted me to get a degree more than anything so they paid for it  that being said i actually had my dream job in my field of study before even graduated but i soon learned that i actually hated it    tldr  im glad i went  i think im a better person for having gone through it  but im glad i didnt go into debt for it either
  i flunked out my junior year when i was taking classical mechanics and calculus 3 the classes had gotten pretty hard and between that and my mental illness i was overwhelmed i went out in the woods and bashed my head with a rock and gave myself a concussion so that i would have an excuse for failing my classes when i told my parents after that i spent some time homeless and lived in my car for a little bit before eventually enlisting in the military but im about to be kicked out because of my aforementioned mentall illness after that i dont know what ill do    yeah pan sonic is great
american literature undergrad here can confirm the left has their teeth firmly sunk into the succulent meat of the art school zoomers prepare for  toni morrison  last exit to brooklyn  teachers that dont to critique work harshly  half of student work being militantly political  being accused of thought crimes   pitiful gened classes that everyone has to take  more toni morrison  overall though you shouldnt go into the arts expecting to learn your skill but expecting to learn how to monetize it
    i dont know who any of these people are
at my mediocre state school its a pretty even balance of pretty conservative oldschool professors who gravitate towards hemingway faulkner melville or joyce im pretty sure the department chair only reads hemingway all he does in his lectures is quote episodes of the simpsons and roast undergrads there are some stereotypical marxists around but theyre actually pretty chill and most of them will listen to your argument even if its not the politically correct one all in all its an open forum of discussion but the students are the ones who tend to cloister around liberal identity politics and become thought police
  fuck yeah /ambidextrous/ reporting in    in all seriousness though i went to a 500 student sociology class and the instructor was talking about blue jeans and who didnt wear them and because autism i didnt understand the question was hyperbole and raised my hand because i literally only wear black slacks always    i was the only one    she thought i was faking it for attention 
  here in the continent they want us to ask questions  yeah just dont say anything which could be considered bigoted
  asking questions is demanded  as long as you dont ask the wrong type of questions
it was pretty comfy if you go into it expecting some kind of practical vocational training youre going to end up disappointed and bitter but if you simply intend to engage with texts in a meaningful critical way for your own personal fulfillment and growth its pretty nice     career wise you definitely need to have your own path carved out unless you intend on going into education but really having any degree is going to be an advantage over those who dont have one so its not wholly useless
  arent you at least taking classes that go over shakespeare and other classic lit there were a couple classes i had to take that i would term leftist but overall the curriculum was alright i thought one class was about caribbean lit which wasnt too bad the other wasnt completely shit either but i was kind of pissed because that was supposed to be my capstone course i had to read night for the second time since middle school and that fucking hack trevor noahs autobiography and the assignments were all easy as shit    also had one teacher for a modernist lit course that the day after the trump election told the class that she knows that lots of people are probably in shambles or something and to come talk to her if they needed comforting didnt say much political beyond that though
  i went to a state school and the professors were hitormiss some stuff i learned in my literature classes hit me super hard at the time and have stayed with me id say it was extremely useful in developing my way of thinking and seeing the world differently ie learning to read the world and interpret the world like you would a text the skills you learn in good literature classes can end up permeating every aspect of your life in the best way possible all in all im very glad i majored in literature instead of something else  if its at all financially possible for you you could go back try a state or city school get some student loans all depending on how ridiculous your debt is already i mean

why dont americans understand that purposely is not a word and that deliberately is a word
  purposely came into english in the late 1400s or early 1500s right in the middle of an lyadverb boom in english its earliest and current meaning is on purpose intentionally
  op now on suicide watch
  blown  the   fuck  out
  fucking smoked
  well deliberately is a better word purposely sounds stupid purpose is a noun deliberate is an adjective
      samfag    i hope you enjoy sounding like a slightly retarded toddler
  irregardless you claimed that it wasnt a word and it is
  damage control
op is fake and also gay
  i like how nonamericans think theyre so sophisticated when really they are just pseuds and pretentious faggots
  it is used but only by people with a poor grasp of grammar makes my anal sphincter contract
  irregardless  6_pixel_hookjpg
  samefagging is a horrible act have you no shame
  grammar laws objective
  today op was a faggot lacking historical and academic rigor basing his judgement on feelings
  ethered
  nothing triggers me like unironic usage of this word    the other one is business people using the word ask instead of request and learnings instead of lessons fucking madness
  this huge amount of salt  oh god op have some self respect
regardless of purposely being a word perhaps people simply mispronounce purposefully

do you read in your native language a foreign language    preface  i am a russian who traveled to portugal at 4 yo i still speak russian at home but i went through with my education in portuguese reading plenty of literature in school despite hating it and feeling forced to do so at the time meanwhile i learned english naturally and kind of effortlessly as time went by because i was always a nerdy kid who spent a considerable amount of time at the computer people grammar nazzid me throughout the years and i became comfortable with the language     recently i started reading and i chose to read books in english for whatever reason i read some selfhelp books which i had no trouble with and wanted to move on to some classics that the wiki recommended i chose the great gatsby i went and bought a bilingual version of the book english and portuguese side by side and i had some trouble interpreting what i was reading as i read the english side but when i read the portuguese side the pictures were seamlessly painted in my head     on the other hand reading more technical books seems like the devil in portuguese in comparison to english     what are your experiences with switching languages anons
i started reading since 2012 despite not enjoying it at all went to college library and took random books took me like 3 to 4 months to read interview with the vampire since i couldnt into reading comprehension and i was slow as fuck too put the book back and took another random book out again did that for years until i took a creative class course     by the end of semester we had to write a 20 page story when i started typing my story i knew i couldnt do it i have never read literature in my spic language before every time i tried to write words in english popped into my head scenarios character names nothing in my story made sense in spanishspeaking context

is agape agape any good ive never eead gaddis but it says he took inspiration from bernhard in writing this so now i am interested
  there are some cool insights but the central theme is whiny baby bullshit its not exactly what you would call a finished work good thing he never released it besides the thrust of the book is already in jr its about 50 pages adjusted for the giant font in the penguin edition just download it
my favorite book of all time is the fault in our stars by john green  what type of person do you imagine
a teenage girl
    my creative writing professor
a teenage slut
  who painted this
i imagine hank green
    this a beefedout harlot who drips new strains of hpv just as her roastie invents them
    teenage    no its an early 20s failed stacy who posts on reddit and tumblr
  early 20s  not teenage  kek as if there is any diference universities are most of the time high school 20 normies still act the same way and with the same principles they ever did  unless you have a serious job or a very hard working degree to take people arent gonna grow up that much atleast in my opinion
  its not about growing up its about the cultural differences of the two groups teenagers wont be reading this book its not timeless like harry potter or whatever like something like twilight its passed its expiration date
  be me 4 years ago  at a birthday party dinner  go around table describing what fictional character wed like to be  a new girlfriend there says hazel grace  me you want cancer  friend you want to die    she didnt last long
  says the nigger who uses reddit spacing
  you dont know what reddit spacing is
  cultural differences of the two groups  would argue that the differences arent that great i have 2 younger brothers one in highschool and another in university all of them including their friends act the same and have same culture    teenagers wont be reading this book  99 of teenagers dont even read books you even get mocked and called boring by them if you do
  my mom liked it but her real favorite is the aeneid i cant even think of a creature favoring this
  faggot    looking for alaska is the only good john green book
  would argue that the differences arent that great    you misunderstand what im saying the toys and media consumed are not the same even if they are from the same cloth im just pointing up a book like this from 2012 is only going to be read by teenagers and preteens of that time period some other trendy carbon copy is being read by current teens or will be soon this book is the equivalent of boy bands teenagers arent listening to the backstreet boys
  ah i get what your saying its diferent but the essence is still the same  sorry for the misunderstood my brain isnt working properly today

im gonna step on the gass
  rip
the greatest american novel
good book i miss gass hope hes brappin still also i missyoustill
  missing the complex metaphors of pinecone reading it was like bathing in a milkshake the first 1/3 was unbearably depressing but it lets up by the end i dont know why gass drops hints that the author is lying about the tunnel the art is unsettling af     
the best novel written by americas foremost prose stylist you cant go wrong with mr dick with a thesaurus
  the complex metaphors of pinecone  what do you mean by complex metaphor or whats an example
  not that guy but  essentially theyre both books about dicks  gravitys rainbow is a more creative and interesting story the tunnel is more stylistic

  bad only quit on that and naked lunch
  quit naked lunch  the utter pleberry of you
work of a hack
  but its an easy read wotta pleb
    what dont you like about it
    not him but i also quit naked lunch its grotesque and burroughs is a shit writer
didnt he spend like 20 years writing this
what is this about some fat poltard or some shit
  30 but he admits its closer to 10
one of my favorite books
  why
omensetters luck is his best
  most of it was complete by the end of the 60s took his time polishing it and finding someone to publish it correctly even the dalkey version is black and white only book is in color
dude racism and antisemitism doesnt stem from socioeconomic factors but years of you getting slighted for having a tiny dick look at this runon sentence    its shit academics cant write fiction
  happy hannukah
  youre saying that to gass because its one of the most antiantisemitic books ever written any form of racism in gass eyes is because youre ugly and have a tiny dick theres no room for any other kind of analysis hate is because youre a cuck
  so this book is a 600 page strawman
    thats right though
  that he spent 20 years writing
  tomorrow i will get gass reader might post something from it here       kys
  hes dead jim     also youre a shockingly bad reader and celebrating the holiday a bit too hardslow down with the manischewitz
should i bu this or not can someone tell me what this is about
  gass was a hardcore philosemite so it centers around goyish appealing to jewish narratives and unless you are a masochist who likes to wallow in depressive thoughts its probably not worth your time gass was a great writer but like most of this fading period his talents were largely squandered by the jewishderived cultural poison he imbibed and its thematic pervasiveness in his work which is childish scatological and devoid of maturity and cultural stewardship we must expect from the generations preceeding our own
  jew jew jew  can someone with a high iq tell me what this book is about
  tomorrow i will get gass reader might post something from it here  highly negative review of the gass reader by a big gass fan     read before purchase
  not sees not sees not sees  so its about jewish shit
  a possibly fascist professor is digging a tunnel underneath his house while writing about the pronazi historian whose work he always loved and there are lots of drawings and designs throughout the book i got all that from the wiki
  any evidence
  yesproofs
  this fucking moron hasnt read it
    of what exactly      i read enough of it
  youre saying its an antisemitic work
  pretending to have read it  get fucked bucko
  of what that post is saying or are you retarded
  implying its antisemitic
  i gave an overview of jewish cultural control and its effect on the boomer and protoboomer mind if you have any questions regarding that you need to be specific
  youre a retard that assumes because a book has racist characters and scenes that the author and books purpose must also be racist   youre literally no better than over sensitive sjw types
  but nothing related to the book      im not assuming anything back up your argument stupid you cant and wont
  kohler is not portrayed as a truly sympathetic character and the story is essentially the artistic exercise of his own destruction
  what isnt sympathetic about kohler     and his own destruction wha seriously did you read it if so where did you get these ideas from theyre not in the text and since theyre not in the text youre either a fraud or oh gawd
  his realization that he is an outcast flawed man who really only hates the women in his life in the end the book reveals his error of getting into poetry instead of history  i know you only understand surface level things and automatically assume the presentation is the message but you are a retard  just do research on gass himself
  getting into history instead of poetry
  gambler addict abuser racist schizo   and all admitted  are you actually a moron
  where is this realization you do realize he loves his wife and shes his saving grace    and what about gass himself is relevant here are you familiar with his influences if so how do they fit in    why did you answer the question about his destruction with he realized he is an outcast flawed man ill stop pointing out your cognitive abilities since they are on display      nice try bruh     schizo  evidence of course not    addict  addicted to    abuser  right when he hits his wife and kids when he verbally abuses his wife what are you talking about    racist  against azerbazers or what     gambler  so you didnt read it
  schizo  the tunnel isnt real  and gass himself each of kohlers colleagues is also one of his personalities here we deal with the most obnoxious and omnipresent one    addict  his political delusions candy at the end    abuser  he strangles his kid to stop him from crying    racist  jews foreigners    gambler  its at the end yknow thea important part you never got to
  gas gas gas
  the tunnel isnt real  yes its a postmodern book kohler also isnt real well besides sharing gass biography and brain    addict  thank you for admitting youre wrong    strangles kid  page pl0x he does strangle the cat     jews foreigners  those arent races    important part i never got  do elaborate mr mysterious
  you are definitely a poor reader
  youre oh for oh so far either you admit or prove youre wrong dodge the question or say i missed something without backing it up    i like that you took gass comment about the personalities as a roman à clef by your lights that an example of being a shallow reader or deep    will you provide any content is this going to go nowhere
  a roman à clef  no thats not what that is  youre a moron im not going to reread it for you do it yourself this time with the knowledge that is art and people play funny little games with the medium but at the end of the day no one becomes successful writing hateliterature it all serves a marketable purpose youre just one of those negative morons who cant see beyond your own nose/interpretation
  you mean read it for the first time    did you concede youre totally wrong by not being able to answer anything and totally backing down    haha faggot    no one becomes successful writing hateliterature  lets let that hang there    stay stupid dr cannot communicate
  angry internet guy strongly identifies with and cannot withstand criticism of his superficial interpretation of his fictional idol who hes unaware is actually a literal parody of his own pathetic nature made by an actually intelligent author with an ounce of selfawareness
  bruh contribute or be quiet no one falls for the kayaky pseuditry youre putting out there mind reading over the internet is cringe    im trying to provoke a conversation out of you but youre not offering anything oy vey
  bruh  multiple times  pl0x  dismissive nyahnyah attitude   strange vain compulsion to exclusively post with other peoples exotic artwork hoping youll superficially associate any sort of taste with his words  kill yourself
  bruh i admit it i said bruh are you denying being the signified of my signifier bitch pl0x youre being asked questions not being dismissed you reply with mind reading you have offered nothing except some inaccuracies handily identified by my searing eye some stuff gass said but outside the context of wittgenstein im not sure whyand of course all the unanswered questions that could have showed me to be less than a sparkling wit and make you seem like less of a kvetchy schmuck here is some more art    bottom text

  youve been backed into a corner this is amazing what a noncontributing baby     you really think there was a moral lesson and you really cant intellectually defend yourself its because youre some alloy of dumb and wrong lets see what bullshit you offer next
  doesnt know how to read a book   thinks there was ever supposed to be a moral other than the realization that youre retarded for denying and dodging the initial points  makes sense but its been downhill from there im not going to provide citations to someone who clearly cant even analyze a book beyond his own wishful thinking
  not going to provide citations  because you cant you cant think cant write or argue coherently no discernible talent i can back that up for you if you want
  only responds in the forms of memes and assumptions  projects onto me that im the one who cant think  still retarded  huh
  gass was a hardcore philosemite   why do you say this    so it centers around goyish appealing to jewish narratives  such as    but like most of this fading period   youre unaware this was written along with almost everything else he wrote    his talents were largely squandered by the jewishderived cultural poison  like what    he imbibed and its thematic pervasiveness in his work which is childish scatological and devoid of maturity and cultural stewardship we must expect from the generations preceeding our own  lets just have this hang out here    i read enough of it  and let this hang out there    i gave an overview of jewish cultural control  where    youre a retard that assumes because a book has racist characters and scenes that the author and books purpose must also be racist  you didnt name any races remember    artistic exercise of his own destruction  you didnt answer this remember    i am going to assume the rest is fresh in your mind
  why dont you think about it  i know in your world people are only as real as you pretend but the reality is you are a poor reader and you are not to be trusted when it comes to interpreting meta significance and character analysis i suspect autism might be the cause
  look i admit i missed the post where you said you read enough of it theres nothing to discuss with you if i can see through you realise other people can too haha you fucking dummy
  could be me if you can back anything up for fucks sake
  that wasnt me but i agree with him
  you dont get it  its just one step above your supposedly deep interpretation  you are in the darkest part which due to your own deafdumbness makes it difficult for you to find the light that is also apparent to the intelligent kind
    didnt read it
  didnt understand it
  that was me and im glad you do because im right    wasnt sure what was going on itt after that so i checked out       fucking idiot most of those are my points from hours ago and i have not been the one interacting with you
what sort of book is this
  fucking cringe
  a big fucking waste of time just read ulysses twice
  this man knows
  unbearably white
  do you know where you are shitskin
  white is code for wasp
  4chan  white board  pol brainwashing  we are weebs of all shapes and colors except black
  white board  got a problem with that
  yeah its inaccurate and fosters a terrible board culture
  this is a white culture board if you arent white you need to leave
  im a pale wealthy latino with lots of jewish friends
why does everyone here talk about politics philosophy and women i just want to talk about literature can you guys go somewhere else i make /lit/ threads myself but everyone is always replying to the meme threads this is the only place i have to talk about literature please stop ruining it
stop posting abrogated decrees
  youre right too many faggots who dont read posting here
  based      hiro in image  why why must you torment me with these jezebels every day i come to /lit/ and every day its the same thing incredibly attractive cuties posing coquettishly for the camera as if to seduce the reader as a celibate person i must protest these puerile distractions they have nothing to do with the subject of literature and only celebrate the lowest of low culture please go with god
  if nobody replies to your threads its because they arent very good in the first place
  no it is because no one here reads in the first place
dont you know how 4chinks works  you post thing you hate and pretend you like it until other autist pretend to hate what you like
  shut up cuck    reading is boring and for nerds
  why are you on the literature board then bitch
  this is true i only read /lit/ its enough to pass off as though i read lit
people on this board are so vain that they posture over books they pretend to have read anonymously thats right they are trying to signal social standing with posts that can never be connected to any other one they post or them as a personthe only person they could possibly be posturing to is themselves every single thread on a book will include a greentext of the book name attached with a disgusted looking harold bloom who they of course havent read thats how people argue here they just post a smug ohh i cant believe youd read something like that or snicker you actually think that with no context im convinced that no one has actually read a book on this board theyve just memorized names and faces and vague ideas associated with them and just bounce the same baseless conceptions back and forth between each other until it forms a board wide gestalt consciousness of pseud like someone here could show you the most obscure portrait of kant looking like a negrogoblin a wacky anecdote about coffee or his masturbation habits but ask them anything about his actual philosophy and you will get total silence ask about an entrylevel book total silence ask about a basic grammar concept total silence ask which author had the biggest forehead 100 replies with the most bitter arguments imaginable how anybody could think this place the last bastion of literary culture is unimaginable this board is the theoretical zeropoint of intelligent discussion on the internet
  for memes     and for the satisfaction of shitting on cucks like you how does it feel to know im gonna keep shitposting all over your board and crossposting to reddit and there is nothing you can do about it
  meta threads just get deleted now anon
  idk maybe because those topics are more important than your effeminate book club the proper use of this board is to vanquish the pettiness of the soul and this is done by reading great literature which is always philosophical in nature coming to an objective understanding of the menace that is woman and internalizing the vanity of day to day politics
  well done anon i had some hearty keks with your post this is so funny cause its true
bumping
  why dont you go somewhere else  shoo shoo
  faggot
  /pol/ fucked up 4chan beyond any hope of redemption its eternal september and youre better off leaving than hoping it will change
  threads with this image are always shit
  i legitimately havent read a book in 8 years
  based and redpilled books are a zionist conspiracy to keep the white man down
  where else is there to go the eternal september refers to the whole of the internet for a reason     nothing will ever be like it was again this is the last closest thing
  ohoh yeah yeah well im gonna im gonna kick your teeth in you big meaniepantsface how do you liek that huh huh    here have a reaction
  there is nowhere to go the internet as it stood is dead crushed under the numbers and tyranny of hoi polloi     you could try the old ocho chan but things move real slow over there
  the patrician thing to do is to develop multiple personalities and debate the books youve read with the various aspects of yourself be careful you can induce schizophrenia through excessive loneliness and drug abuse but by this point you probably wont care
  philosophy threads are among the best on the board
  spinoza tgread with 200 replies jews  women are the inferior sex trust me on this ive read my schops  marxisn made by the jews to destroy the western civilization  baudrillard deleuze derrida foucault all neomarxist postmodern fag jews with nothing of substance to say just read the bible and job  remember to wash your penis  they sure are
  but all of that is right tho
  there are actual deleuze threads  i get that you dont like pol but theres no reason to say all the threads are bad
is that true op doesnt surprise me if so this place as a whole not just /lit/ is so cancerous nowadays    i first visited /lit/ years ago and people were actually discussing books got a lot of genuine recommendations shame i wonder how /sci/ is doing wonder if its also awful
  with  jbp
  the slower and more niche a board is the better the community every popular board gets spillover from /b/ pol and r9k
  obviously those things are all true but that doesnt mean you get to dismiss all the other great philosophy discussion on this board
  they arent    the majority of philosophy is boring as shit anyway and the primary purpose of this board is to talk about literary fiction genre fiction poetry and creative writing just go to /his/ if you want to talk about philosophy
  just go to /his/ if you want to talk about philosophy
  those are some rough generalizations it feels like that on the surface but threads like that go deeper most of the time besides theres always some anons trying to conter argue such claims it gets pretty interesting most of the time
  you /n also based and redpilled
  this is funny and true but i dont see why that is such a bad thing i read not an incredible amount but i at least get 2  4 books done a month as i balance it with my busy schedule the thing is the appeal of /lit/ is that i can joke around about things that i couldnt anywhere else i like reading but it doesnt mean i want to exchange deep reading analysis of everything i read if i really wanted that then i would enroll in a lit or philosophy class
  save this post /lit/ in a nutshell
              youre cherrypicking  just one thread  show me a good philosophy discussion thread
  politics   philosophy   women  literally every book ever   youre fucking retarded
  i dont read and only get my opinions about literature from shitposts here this makes me better than 90 of the population
do you guys ever think about the fact that moot created /his/ to destroy /lit/ from within
  moot had gone by the time his was created gookmoot made /his/
  it was an attempt to quarantine all the west civ muh romans fags
  it was originally an attempt to end the high school stoner philosophy threads and the marx threads  dude what if nothing is real lmao  but as you can see it failed miserably in this regard
  why does everyone here talk about politics philosophy and women i just want to talk about literature can you guys go somewhere else i make /lit/ threads myself but everyone is always replying to the meme threads  you answered it yourself everyone talks about those things because they are what generate replies people want activity before they want quality the result is a lack of quality activity i made a real thread earlier on actual literature it is languishing on its way to page 10 as we speak
  why would you take the time to post a cogent comment like this and then associate it with bloom
  remember to wash your penis  jbp books should come with wet naps included
  youd have to be a moron to really believe this anyone who has spent a significant amount of time on /lit/ and enjoyed one of its diamonds in the rough understands that the board is worthwhile and what our newfag friend here describes is mostly done for ironys sake
  if you come to this website for anything beside memes and shitposts youre gonna be disappointing /lit/ was never smart but affecting the pretentious well read persona became a meme and now you have retards who actually buy into it
  i feel ya brother neither /pol/s nor r/philosophys presence here will allow me to discuss ayn rand apolitically sucks man  and i know if objectivism undergoes another period of resurgence in the larger culture leddit will reinstigate another rand war like back in the day

norm macdonald is a genius did you know he reads russian literature
norm actually is a genius entertainer and his mild interest in literature doesnt factor into that at all
im not norm ruined norm for me i didnt realize a lot of his basic banter is actually a joke he frequently uses hes not a spontaneously funny or engaging person and he even admits he tires to make it seem like hes just making it up as he goes but isnt a good enough comic actor to do that it seems the best way to make it somewhat believable is to make the jokes not funny
  comedians have material they use repeatedly  wow very sharp anon next youll tell me guitarists reuse licks
  your wrong reading russian lit turned him into a genius ask david letterman
i heard about this on reddit
   im not talking about his standup but all of his interviews its not his stories its all his mannerisms and comments the ones that dont even seem like jokes his whole personality is fake hes not a spontaneously funny or interesting person he doesnt have a quick wit and when you look at how meticulous everything is you just wonder why he isnt funnier
what do we think
  i think grecolatin squares i think donald knuths favorite book i think oulipo i think the rues of paris i think nouveau roman and hitchhikers guide to the galaxy i think big lists that kind of things i think
  bolaño liked it

ok so i just finished moby dick i loved the first about 100 pages it was complete magic i was hooked then it just got dull and uneventful thoughts
  you are not appreciating some gorgeous prose
anon you might be gay
  also obvious bait
  are those baked beans inside a donut

i know this is probably a troll but that exact opinion is how you can mark someone that dropped it midway through every single time you press them for more specific criticism they cave and admit to dropping it because of the beautiful whale knowledge sections
  nigga the last 100 pages has all the best parts
  the virgin white whale vs the chad black bull
  i love those sections i know this will make people mad but i honestly wish melville had just focused on being an artful nonfiction writer rather than an erudite fiction writer
  oh my captain my captain noble soul grand old heart after all why should any one give chase to that hated fish away with me let us fly these deadly waters let us home wife and child too are starbuckswife and child of his brotherly sisterly playfellow youth even as thine sir are the wife and child of thy loving longing paternal old age away let us awaythis instant let me alter the course how cheerily how hilariously o my captain would we bowl on our way to see old nantucket again i think sir they have some such mild blue days even as this in nantucket    tfw starbuck almost convinces ahab to give up the chase right at the last moment
  i enjoyed them a lot too they kill the pacing a little in the middle but the book would be far worse off without them well written non fiction something we direly need more of too
  the flags on that shirt  kek
are screenplays considered /lit/
  lol i wrote one last year i started by writing scenes with a common theme in the hopes of developing short stories  it was probably the best shit i have written and that speaks poorly of me as a writer
book for this feel  ive witnessed incognito the gradual collapse of my life the slow foundering of all that i wanted to be i can say with a truth that needs no flowers to show its dead that theres nothing ive wanted  and nothing in which ive placed even for a moment the dream of only that moment  that hasnt disintegrated below my windows like a clod of dirt that resembled stone until it fell from a flowerpot on a high balcony it would even seem that fate has always tried to make me love or want things just so that it could show me on the very next day that i didnt have and could never have them but as an ironic spectator of myself ive never lost interest in seeing what life brings and since i now know beforehand that every vague hope will end in disillusion i have the special delight of already enjoying the disillusion with the hope like the bitter with the sweet that makes the sweet sweeter by way of contrast im a sullen strategist who having never won a battle has learned to derive pleasure from mapping out the details of his inevitable retreat on the eve of each new engagement my destiny which has pursued me like a malevolent creature is to be able to desire only what i know ill never get if i see the nubile figure of a girl in the street and imagine for the slightest moment however nonchalantly what it would be like if she were mine its a dead certainty that ten steps past my dream shell meet the man whos obviously her husband or lover a romantic would make a tragedy out of this a stranger to the situation would see it as a comedy i however mix the two things since im romantic in myself and a stranger to myself and i turn the page to yet another irony some say that without hope life is impossible others that with hope its empty for me since ive stopped hoping or not hoping life is simply an external picture that includes me and that i look at like a show without a plot made only to please the eyes  an incoherent dance a rustling of leaves in the wind clouds in which the sunlight changes colour ancient streets that wind every which way around the city i am in large measure the selfsame prose i write i unroll myself in sentences and paragraphs i punctuate myself in my arranging and rearranging of images im like a child using newspaper to dress up as a king and in the way i create rhythm with a series of words im like a lunatic adorning my hair with dried flowers that are still alive in my dreams and above all im calm like a rag doll that has become conscious of itself and occasionally shakes its head to make the tiny bell on top of its pointed cap a component part of the same head produce a sound the jingling life of a dead man a feeble notice to fate
  but how often in the middle of this peaceful dissatisfaction my conscious emotion is slowly filled with a feeling of emptiness and tedium for thinking this way how often i feel as if hearing a voice behind intermittent sounds that i myself am the underlying bitterness of this life so alien to human life  a life in which nothing happens except in its selfawareness how often waking up for a moment from this exile thats me i get a glimpse of how much better it would be to be a complete nobody the happy man who at least has real bitterness the contented man who feels fatigue instead of tedium who suffers instead of imagining he suffers who kills himself yes instead of watching himself die ive made myself into the character of a book a life one reads whatever i feel is felt against my will so that i can write that i felt it whatever i think is promptly put into words mixed with images that undo it cast into rhythms that are something else altogether from so much selfrevising ive destroyed myself from so much selfthinking im now my thoughts and not i i plumbed myself and dropped the plumb i spend my life wondering if im deep or not with no remaining plumb except my gaze that shows me  blackly vivid in the mirror at the bottom of the well  my own face that observes me observing it im like a playing card belonging to an old and unrecognizable suit  the sole survivor of a lost deck i have no meaning i dont know my worth theres nothing i can compare myself with to discover what i am and to make such a discovery would be of no use to anyone and so describing myself in image after image  not without truth but with lies mixed in  i end up more in the images than in me stating myself until i no longer exist writing with my soul for ink useful for nothing except writing but the reaction ceases and again i resign myself i go back to whom i am even if its nothing and a hint of tears that werent cried makes my stiff eyes burn a hint of anguish that wasnt felt gets caught in my dry throat but i dont even know what i would have cried over if id cried nor why it is that i didnt cry over it the fiction follows me like my shadow and what i want is to sleep

  the foremost country with respect to cinema and music
  got a problem with facts   what countrys artistic output this decade can compete with koreas its not even close
country that didnt fucking exist half a century ago  implying their national mentality could produce anything of cultural value  no wonder their only explorts are technology and autism
  korean cinemas renaissance of the earlymid 2000s has well passed and now they just make generic crap  kpop is manufactured garbage only notable korean album of all year is pic related
  korean cinemas renaissance of the earlymid 2000s has well passed and now they just make generic crap  kpop is manufactured garbage only notable korean album of all year is pic related  t philistine

  who is this mushfaced child and why is op trying to jezebel her    we had this thread already korea produces almost nothing of literary merit

  do you enjoy han kang  ah yes the only korean writer   i quite enjoyed the white book it was poetical and evocative made me question whether it was fictional or a memoir
  cmon man just admit youre horny as fuck go to korea and go get fucking oh right have you even been to skorea do you speak and read in korean
  klit  wait a minute
  only notable korean album is one rateyourmusic told me was good
i just finished pic related    are there any other books on the same subject that might be interesting
what was so dark they couldnt poo in the streets as often lmao
pic related is good if you want more anglo perfidiousness if you want an alternate take on the british empire niall fergusons empire argues the case in favour william dalrymple is worth checking out writes history that reads like a gripping novel white muhgals is a good starting point for him  good fiction could be kipling especially his early short stories and kim or em forster the flashman novels are a great fun genre read but are actually very well researched and a few deal with british india

ask an english teacher anything might not answer everything
  what grade level do you teach and what was your process of higher education
  1116 year olds schoolcollegeuniversityin school training
how do you convince 1116 year olds that they need more polished grammar and fancier rhetoric
what books do you teach
  if you dont do this you will fail  how do you expect to get a job if you cant write    the younger they are the more they enjoy learning for the sake of it  the older ones usually have exam pressure which makes them work most kids are stupid so they often want to sound smarter because thats what impresses them
  so a carrotonastick for the ambitious ones and a whip for the lazy ones the joy of learning
  the younger they are the more they enjoy learning for the sake of it  the older ones usually have exam pressure which makes them work most kids are stupid so they often want to sound smarter because thats what impresses them  what kind of fucking kids are you teaching this is the polar opposite of what kids are like
i supply taught middle school for a bit  it was fun joking around but dealing with kids as a job kept giving me existential crises   does that ever happen to you
  i didnt mention anything about punishment if they dont pay attention at school statistically life will be harder for them they need to be aware of that      normal kids the popular perception of young people could not be further from the truth most kids want to do well now
what do you do when one of your students looks like this    do you not feel the urge to skullfuck her
  i didnt mention anything about punishment if they dont pay attention at school statistically life will be harder for them they need to be aware of that  a psychological whip is still a whip
  i enjoy it to be honest sometimes i worry about the future for the really weak kids but the world needs less academic people as well
  its not about punishment it just seems that this teaching style isnt about sincerely teaching kids but rather getting them to fill ur quota for the schools admin
    this guy gets it the curriculum in my country needs a serious reform    also a bit of a whip from a teacher could be all it takes to stop them getting a fucking axe to the head when they cant even get a job in mcdonalds
  which uni you stall what you study what your qualifications

  not sure how you have the authority to call a student weak or not if you studied lit at some random uni without even having the grades to move on to postgraduate edutainment    did you start with the aegyptians
  i also have a pgce    this is a weak troll
  i also know some guy who has a certificate of further education in japanese folklore doesnt mean jack    and laughable you actually think taking auncient culture seriously is trolling    enjoy contributing to the farce which is contemporary education you are like all the other parasites in it
  gr8 b8    i already said the curriculum needs serious reform    did someone get set a detention today sure seems like it
  education bad  wonder where this tourist is from
  which further education do you have  further educaytoon means nothen    yikes
  but to what if you dont actually take aegyptian akkadian persian indian greek roman and various other pagan cultures seriously or know anything about them what exactly are you going to change it to
  i meant he doesnt have even a masters which means jack
  you dont know what i know about any of those cultures     id personally change it so that they read bukowski and ruppi kaur for the entire duration of their school life

when stephen dedalus meets the girl/muse on the beach im not the only one who read that as him stumbling upon the girl pissing on the beach thats what i thought the first time i read it then i read it a second time and still thought that a little but less so maybe thats not what was happening then i read it for a third time for a college class and am now completely uncertain it seems like at first thats what he is describing but upon a closer look it doesnt appear so i didnt want to bring this up in class so an not to look weird though i know and knew then joyce liked to write things like that ive read his entire oeuvre so did anyone else read it that way
  a girl stood before him in midstream alone and still gazing out to sea she seemed like one whom magic had changed into the likeness of a strange and beautiful seabird her long slender bare legs were delicate as a cranes and pure save where an emerald trail of seaweed had fashioned itself as a sign upon the flesh her thighs fuller and softhued as ivory were bared almost to the hips where the white fringes of her drawers were like feathering of soft white down her slateblue skirts were kilted boldly about her waist and dovetailed behind her her bosom was as a birds soft and slight slight and soft as the breast of some darkplumaged dove but her long fair hair was girlish and girlish and touched with the wonder of mortal beauty her face    she was alone and still gazing out to sea and when she felt his presence and the worship of his eyes her eyes turned to him in quiet sufferance of his gaze without shame or wantonness long long she suffered his gaze and then quietly withdrew her eyes from his and bent them towards the stream gently stirring the water with her foot hither and thither the first faint noise of gently moving water broke the silence low and faint and whispering faint as the bells of sleep hither and thither hither and thither and a faint flame trembled on her cheek    shes got her drawers on op
  which book is this from
without rereading the chapter isnt it the dog that pisses on the beach
  thats ulysses not portrait
  no no its a jew who wanks on the beach
  arent we talking about stephen in the first part of ulysses
  stephen is the protagonist in portrait of the artist as a young man also
  gently stirring the water with her foot hither and thither  the only thing that makes me think she is sitting near a small natural stream of water running down to the ocean and not pissing could be either though
  yes i know but this episode of him on the beach was from ulysses not portrait wasnt it
  theres an episode on the beach on both
  didnt op just interpret in midstream as in the middle of pissing instead of in the middle of the stream of the ocean    probably joyces purpose as well
this book was so good     its sad that bernard marx was so damn relatable   thoughts
  i didnt find bernard marx relatable at all despite hating the civilization he still wanted to be a part of it i found helmholtz and john to be much more relatable myself
  hows the lenguage for a nonnative ive read hemingway and similar stuff but i cant read nabokov or pynchon
  the language isnt hard at all but its not a particularly well written book the ideas are the point way easier than nabokov or pynchon  also i assume you read lolita but which pynchon book did you try
  the language is all quite simple from what i remember but he does add quite a few of his own made up words so that might be a little confusing
i agree with this pretty girl  
  make sure you know what indefatigable means
    you must be a huge pleb for thinking that babys first dystopia is actually good
my favorite book is revolt against the modern world    what type of person do you imagine
  someone who doesnt read
extremely based  incredibly redpilled
this will trigger the libshits honesty hurts the person i imagine is someone who works at a suburban subway wears a tweed coat and smokes a pipe they are considered quite the intellectual by their family and gamer compatriots despite this they have no acedemic aclaim and only share their ideas with redpilled comrades as they reject the degeneracy of acedemia prefering instead to keep their integrity by restricting their genius to influencing the world from the shadows they keep an irregular workout routine they are an appealing and likable person but they can not find a mate amoungst the pathetic degenerate population of contemporary western whores they take care of their own needs but value celibacy making frequent promises to stop masturbating they fall short of their desires but make progress lowering their average to between one and two faps a day
that depends either the person has actually read evola and taken into heart what he said or the person is some cuck trump supporter who thinks evola can be used to justify his beliefs
  get out of my head
    great keks
  replace the word comrades with brothers and this is literally any /pol/ak
evola stated whom he was addressing so theres no point in asking    what i am about to say does not concern the ordinary man of our day on the contrary i have in mind the man who finds himself involved in todays world even at its problematic and paroxysmal points yet he does not belong inwardly to such a world nor will he give in to it he feels himself in essence as belonging to a different race from that of the overwhelming majority of his contemporaries    the natural place for such a man the land in which he would not be a stranger is the world of tradition    more or less the лишний чeлoвeк
  lmao implying i work im 30 soon and still living at home with my parents i still have savings i can spend on beer and books living the dream
  living the dream  what a dream 
  pretty much me when i was younger except i didnt have to work fortunately found an oriental aristocrat to marry
i would assume theyre an idiot or havent read it because thats how it seems with a lot of people ive seen talk about it i wish people would take it more seriously because i think evola did something unique which is create a traditional civilization and show us how it worked his elaboration of various symbols and concepts like regality are invaluable for studying literature of all sorts

  this did the opposite for me  it was the true blackpill  wilde shows that the halo effect is understated and people only care about the quality of presentations

living a hedonistic life   what does this even mean  how do you get anything out of life if youre lazy how is it hedonistic if youre not lazy    by that logic only a rich born nonovereating fuck could ever be hedonistic i think that word lost its meaning because today everybody is hedonistic in the sense of what that word meant before nobody bows to a honorable culture of any sense or something  every kid does what it wants
     in two sentences whats the buddhist stance on it i wonder if it says you should better not

why do girls read exactly two types of books  urban fantasy  womanshit written by womyn
  maybe she wants to support her fellow women u dipshit anyway she a cute no racism
  reads 23 books  none of them worth reading    why do women do this if i had the time to read 23 books it certainly wouldnt be wasted on this flavor of the month bullshit
  because theyre dumb and shallow
  not even three minutes in  starts ranting about modern politics and privilege    yikes
  reads animal farm  immediately relates it to contemporary american politics    absolute brainlet
  cute subscribed and liked or should i say loved haha
  based
  she a cute no racism   trips confirm amerie a cute even though shes half moon cricket
  thats all the female brain cares about there is a reason women have been the homemaker throughout human history men go out and explore and conquer the world women stay home and talk about the people around them
  its chiggers faggot
  half moon cricket    is this a slur who can i use it against
  what the fuck is her problem
  more booktubers like this please
  women generally read more widely and more often than men
  and all of that is done with more shallowness than men
  now i did not and will not watch her video but if you are unable to relate a book to contemporary happenings just because it have a historical context and a intended meaning you are the absolute brainlet
  she used animal farm to go on a rant about migrant children kept in cages at the border and white people having privilege thats a brainlet way of interpreting the work to be sure
  i have absolutely no interest in what she said
  derived from early slave times when black people would come out at night and sing slave songs under the moonlight like crickets

what are some of the best quotes excerpts poems lines about depression in world literature    the more poetic not necessarily verse but beautiful prose the better      depression is the flaw in love to be creatures who love we must be creatures who can despair at what we lose and depression is the mechanism of that despair when it comes it degrades ones self and ultimately eclipses the capacity to give or receive affection it is the aloneness within us made manifest and it destroys not only connection to others but also the ability to be peacefully alone with oneself love though it is no prophylactic against depression is what cushions the mind and protects it from itself medications and psychotherapy can renew that protection making it easier to love and be loved and that is why they work in good spirits some love themselves and some love others and some love work and some love god any of these passions can furnish that vital sense of purpose that is the opposite of depression love forsakes us from time to time and we forsake love in depression the meaninglessness of every enterprise and every emotion the meaninglessness of life itself becomes selfevident the only feeling left in this loveless state is insignificance    andrew solomon the noonday demon an atlas of depression

truly great quote op
i cannot think or comprehend of anything more cucked than having a daughter honestly think about it rationally you are feeding clothing raising and rearing a girl for at least 18 years solely so she can go and get ravaged by another man all the hard work you put into your beautiful little girl  reading her stories at bedtime making her go to sports practice making sure she had a healthy diet educating her playing with her all of it has one simple result her body is more enjoyable for the men that will eventually fuck her in every hole    raised the perfect girl great who benefits if youre lucky a random man who had nothing to do with the way she grew up who marries her he gets to fuck her tight pussy every night he gets the benefits of her kind and sweet personality that came from the way you raised her    as a man who has a daughter you are literally dedicating at least 20 years of your life simply to raise a girl for another man to enjoy it is the ultimate and final cuck think about it logically
  are you like 10 this is childish
    post better things then im not claiming to have fished the ultimate perfect quote
  just to be clear im not a professional quote maker im just an atheist teenager who greatly values his intelligence and scientific fact over any silly fiction book written 3500 years ago this being said i am open to any and all criticism    in this moment i am euphoric not because of any phony gods blessing but because i am enlightened by my intelligence
im looking for some nonfiction books on guilt and overcoming a guilty conscience    i did some hurtful and negative things a few years ago and although for a time i thought nothing of it this year i experienced a big change in my outlook and mentality and since then i have been burdened with an intense obsessive guilty every day because of my actions and by confronting the fact i am no longer the good blameless innocent person i once was    can anyone relate to this and are there any relevant nonfiction books youd recommend    im in a hole right now and im not sure if i can get out
bump
what did you do besides bumping rec threads on a slow board that bans rec threads
  i wrote some negative and hurtful posts on 4chan about two semiobscure writers one of whom i think may suspect it was me who wrote the posts i cant get the posts removed from the archive and it appears on google results so im convinced they have seen my unkind posts and felt hurt by them

what about this guy
    bataille has an interesting theory of excess/surplus which he applies to everything from economy to politics from personal relations to which hes the most known for eroticism    nevertheless his description is perhaps a little off even if he presents it in a very interesting way technique doesnt really commit to excesses without reason but quite on the contrary it does so with much efficiency his nonfiction stuff is very good if you read it critically and his fiction stuff is pukeinducing which is not a criticism at all because providing you with limitexperiences is precisely his point
spooky
  why is it puke inducing
  why does the left love so much literally evil writers

  where do you start with this messed up fellow 
some anon posted here that bataille used to feel bad for his mother who would get beat by his drunken father  then one day he saw her enjoying while getting roughly fucked by his dad  is that true
he is god
  hes amazing and completely underrated a great followup to nietzsche readings read the three parts of the accursed share and inner experience
  probably when he found the corpse of his mother his first reaction was to masturbate while looking at it
villainizes bipolar men
  why do you guys read this dumb shit and then complain about it its your fault for even picking it up

  ive had to deal with multiple bipolar people in my life and let me tell you its fucking hard
  implying i can control the thousands of roasties that have read and swallowed this shit       so dont marry them
one thing that catches my eye everytime i see old school street interviews or any audience speaking in talk shows is how articulate and nonjittery common people were in communicating their thoughts and ideas  what do you think has changed this is it just staring at a digital screen that is responsible
  unironically the elevation of low class people to the mainstream media the hip way of speaking is the urbanite way
  g has been falling steadily every decade for 100 years among white populations verbal reasoning assessments both on standardized tests and for ap exams are less g loaded every decade and less rigorous the verbal reasoning of the average white student is lower at the same age than it was for students 50 years ago blacks and hispanics are now an integral part of forming metropolitan dialects we stopped shaming people for syncopating their speech with uh and like about 5 years ago when anticulture finished dissolving the soul of wasp america there are more interviews now conducted by less competent interviewers more indiscriminate selection of subjects and less thoughtful questions salience succinctness concision fluency articulation competence are not prerequisites for being hired or taken seriously you can honestly blame finance and engineeringcs for most of this since you can speak and think like a barbarian and still perform well in those professions

  implying shes wrong
  know whats weird i assumed it was a woman also its not    anyway lets make an annotated list of things she says which are either factually wrong or reasonably unfalsifiable    1 at every socioeconomic level we had a desire to improve ourselves indefensible for a person to speak for every socioeconomic class and the desires of the individuals thereof    2 our entertainment was uplifting depending on creativity and not a series of emotional soundbites rosecolored tethered spectacles aside entertainment has always been subjective    3 our schools gave grades based on merit not whining once again indefensible to speak for an entire generations academic aptitude he gives no evidence or justification for the implication that schools are now an exclusively now reward whining    4  scrabble and monopoly that taught real literacy and lifeskills  point me to one life lesson you can learn from monopoly and ill concede 4    5 not video games where all you do is stare at naked babes and shoot each other gross generalization insertlogicalfallacyhere    6 in 1960  the average american vocabulary consisted of 110000 words citation fucking needed    7 it was not at all uncommon for people to read the dictionary just to learn new words not taking issue with this i just find it hilarious
  point me to one life lesson you can learn from monopoly and ill concede 4  if you overextend your finances then you are vulnerable to bankruptcy if you have unforeseen expenses  it was not at all uncommon for people to read the dictionary just to learn new words not taking issue with this i just find it hilarious  eat shit  i do this all of the time i am going to make a list of english/deutsch cognates soon i already did a sample run to see how it would work and how to format it  all the rest of it  the rest is a little subjective and may have some inaccuracies but is still generally true
  you sound really disgusting
  not an argument
  this
  weve progressed further on the trajectory of liberalism thats it
  on the contrary the decline in quality is a conscious effort all our media is heavily curated by intelligence agencies
i notice this as well and its not just the common people            
  very interesting videos i swear to god they have to be putting something in the water at least i hope its some social engineering eugenics conspiracy by the elites that would be easier to accept than people just accepting all information uncritically and tuning out of society
    intelligent people have abdicated from democracy democracy has no place for the intelligent its average minds always making the most popular decisions
  hey isnt that pic from the abc street interview where they ask if husbands should help with housework
if we accept that people imitate others and in particular imitate media and furthermore know  what are the implications what goal might the elite have here
  ah yes the merit of memorizing the endless latin conjugations and declensions and then forgetting them all the moment you leave school i was taught like that it was wonderful
  white people stole this land from the indigenous so we should let more people in    i wonder how the indigs feel about white people being the decider in letting more foreigners into the stolen land
  my grandfather was fluent in english and deutsch and functional for any scientific purpose in latin and maintained all of this until he went goofy at the end and had bouts where he dropped into deutsch only there may have been other languages of which i was unaware i believe the songs that he used to hum to himself were deutsch and he used this as an exercise to maintain the language he was an optometrist and used the latin as much as possible he availed himself of every opportunity to use his language skills for a business club of which he was a member fwiw he was esl speaking strictly deutsch until he was about five or so you can keep it if you want it most of us do not want it enough
  excuse me what the fuck is your point how is your post related to mine
  and then forgetting them all the moment you leave school
  hes calling you a retard
they all sounded like dumbass australians to me
  mean and rudepilled
  for any scientific purpose in latin  so he had some practical reason to keep his knowledge of latin he was an academic i suppose sure but most people arent dont need latin and  surprise surprise  forget it  regarding german as you say he had the critical exposure to the language in an early age so it wasnt nearly as difficult for him to keep up the knowledge as it would be if he was taught it later on it really is not a miracle to be fluent in two languages anyway  every esl today does that  so all in all your argument is pretty weak
  if you think thats bad listen to the average 2018 astralian

  every esl today does that  my main line of work is in manufacturing so i know a lot of immigrants most of them have shit tier english and let their native tongue go shit tier so their entire language base is shit tier i respectfully disagree with your premise   he was an academic i suppose  later yes in retrospect he unironically ran an automotive import dealership for several years so he had a gap  but he was also involved with the catholic church so he may have used the latin there also my point is that if he had wanted to be lazy then he could easily have dropped most his language abilities he did not need to do all of those things that helped him maintain proficiency he chose to do so i have no real need to keep my deutsch but i sing kinderlieder to my little one  both for his own sake and for keeping the language that i would otherwise lose
  he unironically ran an automotive import dealership for several years  how does one ironically run an automotive import dealership
  jeweler cutting gems and all  not just sales  automotive dealership ownermanager  optometrist  i see this as a total autistic mess of disconcordant occupations taken as a whole it all seems very ironic to me it is hard to believe that he followed this path  and that he had the foresight to build an educational background that allowed him to follow the path he chose you may see otherwise but i was the one that wrote the post from my perspective  not from yours

  hes talking about black people there is merit to that idea but i think it has more to do with pomo thinking leading people to not behave in any particular way hence the legions of quirky weirdos who are basically just socially defective people void of any actual personality except for getting really enthusiastic about stuff books cats the internet hahahaha arent i so unique    social decorum just mattered a lot more back then also doesnt help that we use comparatively frenetic mediums like twitter and television to communicate whereas these guys were almost all reading books for entertainment even the idiots
  whats he like these days  its hard to believe its one dude it is all over the board for quality 10 brilliant 25 garbage with the remainder just being middling or segue art to connect the plot i find him worthwhile on account of the 10 have another off of my favorites pile
why are people so angry at the possibility their forefathers might have done certain things better than them or that the world in some ways might have gotten worse you can see a little bit of it in this topic for example in these posts             instead of arguing to the contrary discussing the points or posting something useful there are angry exclamations and vacuous you cannot know nuffin remarks like it being indefensible for a person to speak for every socioeconomic class and the desires of the individuals thereof

i think its simple we talk less and type more those of us under the age of thirty are used to expression through a medium which allows unlimited time to best construct an idea in some sense this hurts us but i think in another sense it can be beneficial even writing this brief post i chopped and changed and paused and reconsidered and distilled my idea into something digestible without this there is no choice but to be stubborn and simply believe what you believe and be able to say it confidently which was commonplace thirty years ago
  their forefathers might have done certain things better than them  i can concur that both of my grandfathers were amazing men in and of themselves but they were complete failures in passing their abilities on to me as a willing pupil they both lacked the patience to tolerate my failures  a patience that was likely afforded them by their elders
  have you read hitlers critique of the press versus the written word he makes a compelling case for the importance of the spoken word  and being able to tailor a canned speech as it is delivered he attributes his rise to being able to tailor his speeches depending on how his audience was responding to it in each venue no two performances of the same speech would usually be identical he posits that he would never have achieved power through the written word due to the delays inherent in the press at the time causing an inability to react properly to the reader today of course electronic written media is much more responsive
  i agree but i just dont think oratory skill is as relevant today a confident orator will still find success in 2018 jordan peterson comes to mind but the generalised importance of the spoken word is lessening
  but the generalised importance of the spoken word is lessening  i did address this with  today of course electronic written media is much more responsive  still the ability to speak to vendors and customers well is even being lost i know of one company with twenty employees  with only three of them not being terrified to cold call someone for a business matter
  her points are no better she clearly has no idea what the modern world is like games arent all naked kids and shooting each other   what does she think texting consists of its just another form of conversation which requires words   the education system is in a similar state today in fact more young adults are going to university today than in her day   that average word count is going to need citation   it all comes off as someone from a slightly privileged background that has had no interaction with the lower classes in her life and is now looking back with her rosey glasses

  as pathetic as i find them i never understood the charge that male feminists were opportunists ive always found male feminists to be particularly sincere to the extent that hey seem at war with their own masculinity even if that repression results in a particularly nasty hidden shadowself its real    i remember seeing ishiida strips that were selfaware and openminded about the limits of his own understanding it seems like hes become so possessed by his ideology that his view of his own gender doesnt reflect realityhe doesnt have any respect for men and whats more bizarre is that he doesnt seem to actually understand male psychology     maybe by inventing some imaginary false male feminism to lampoon he is projecting and then symbolically killing the masculine traits he represses if he is actually castrating himself psychologically then the absurdity of the male feminist in his comic reflects that his worldview inhibits his own inability to introspect with any clarity
  the problem with this kind of rhetoric is always that it was this generation that raised the current ones and that created the current culture if they were so smart why are their kids so dumb why did they create such a banal and stupid culture to pass down to their kids they failed either intellectually or even worse morally by being bad or negligent or incompetent parents and cultural stewards the present is a product of the past and the past should be judged accordingly

  thats not really the discussion though is it    the question to which the 73yo was reply why do older people regardless of their educational background seem more articulate and speak more eloquently than people from other generations    the answer was a non sequitur with the oldie instead going on about those damn youths things were better in my day making claims without evidence such as my generations vocabulary was four times more robust than yours and expect the opposition to simply nod politely and say mmh yes dear boy you make a valid claim now allow me to rebut the 73yo is not making philosophically compelling points worthy of discussion theyre not engaging in argumentationonly polemic    what the fuck do you want a fucking process essay if the points are already being shot down you can safely assume theyve already been discussed

  this is notion asking for evidence or research for absolutely everything is really stupid if a study hasnt been conducted yet about a topic doesnt mean a claim about it is untrue   you can to just look around and apply some common sense sometimes to verify claims    it isnt false that vocabulary of common people right now is more repetitive than before because of the social media/texting culture

  he like all retarded traditionalists presupposes the natural order by which they almost always mean the social order which exists in the past just beyond the living memory of their generation is good this is taken as an axiom but if you press them youll see its more akin to blind faith for they can never give a coherent justification for this assumption on which they build their ideology

  id love to see op follow that example
are the translations in this book good id rather not buy chaucers works book by book
reading translated chaucer    kill yourself
  im an esl speaker and i dont want to bother with middle english
  translated chaucer   oh no no no
  then why would you read it dipshit
  because i want to
  its just a semisteep hill that soon will become flat ground and delightful to read if you just push on otherwise any translation will do it is just cleared up english after all but it wont be as good as chaucer    smale foweles maken melodye  that slepen all the nyght with open ye    ye means eye and little things like this will be confusing at first but youll be able to read it without problem as you push on and get immersed in his language ive been down that road
  chaucers middle english is easy look up pronunciation guides on youtube buy an annotated edition for vocabulary and youre fine
  buy an annotated edition  i saw a wordsworth edition of the canterbury tales supposedly written to enable readers with little or no previous experience of medieval english to read and enjoy this landmark in english literature it seems lots of notes since its significantly longer than other versions is that the kind of thing i should be looking for
  it seems to have lots of notes
amerimutts need their english translated  top kek  in english doc
  see  and 
  yes lots of words had dropped out of the lexicon even by shakespeares time so youll need the notes to understand everything comprehensively as far as i know the goto scholarly editions are the riverside and broadview editions i have the riverside and its extremely extensive so you might want to look into it it also comes with a pronunciation and grammar guide
  the riverside chaucer has his complete works in middle english with a helpful amount of glossing and notes
  this is the only correct answer
  ignore these guys youre not going to be able to read middle english if youre not completely fluent in english i doubt most american blacks could read it    unfortunately i cant help you with a translation because when i studied chaucer we only read the original
    to add to this you probably need at least a little german french and latin to read medieval english works fluently latin because a lot of quoting of scripture is going on french for obvious historical reasons and german for obvious linguistic reasons
  middle english isnt that hard anon i mean if you cant understand this even as an esl you might be a brainlet    siþen þe sege and þe assaut watz sesed at troye  þe borȝ brittened and brent to brondeȝ and askez  þe tulk þat þe trammes of tresoun þer wroȝt  watz tried for his tricherie þe trewest on erthe  hit watz ennias þe athel and his highe kynde  þat siþen depreced prouinces and patrounes bicome  welneȝe of al þe wele in þe west iles  fro riche romulus to rome ricchis hym swyþe  with gret bobbaunce þat burȝe he biges vpon fyrst  and neuenes hit his aune nome as hit now hat  tirius to tuskan and teldes bigynnes  langaberde in lumbardie lyftes vp homes  and fer ouer þe french flod felix brutus  on mony bonkkes ful brode bretayn he settez  wyth wynne  where werre and wrake and wonder  bi syþez hatz wont þerinne  and oft boþe blysse and blunder  ful skete hatz skyfted synne  ande quen þis bretayn watz bigged bi þis burn rych  bolde bredden þerinne baret þat lofden  in mony turned tyme tene þat wroȝten  mo ferlyes on þis folde han fallen here oft  þen in any oþer þat i wot syn þat ilk tyme  bot of alle þat here bult of bretaygne kynges  ay watz arthur þe hendest as i haf herde telle
  little german french and latin to read medieval english works fluently  no you dont you fucking retard all you need to be is fluent in middle english itself which is easy af to learn even passively from just reading an annotated chaucer
reading literature is about understanding the gist of whats going on
if youre a non native speaker i would suggest reading the translation alongside the middle english until you get the hang of it itll be much more rewarding if you can read the original
  i can kind of understand that but the point i was trying to get across is that i want to read such things without going through the pain decoding them    i doubt you need as many languages but im somewhat familiar with french and to a lesser extent latin
  going through the pain decoding  of somethings wrong with me today
  get the riverside chaucer it has lots of footnotes and guides on chaucers pronunciation and poetry
  its way easier to become good at middle english if you have other languages besides modern english to compare it to a lot of the patterns and vocabulary that arent used anymore are already familiar if you know those languages witen/knouen or the more flexible sentence order for example
  witen/knouen or the more flexible sentence order for example  i know basic dutch maybe that could come in handy

how should i start reading the bible chronologically following a reading program
cover to cover
  italy was fat as fuck back then
youre not going to finish it if you read it chronologically
start with the new testament if you havent read it before
  what about the genesis the exodus etc should i read them later
  yes genesis and exodus are relatively actionpacked so if you want to start there you could but most of the ot isnt nearly as exciting or easy to follow because of that youll do better starting with the nt which will motivate your reading of the ot as well as give you some idea of what you should be looking for
read it in reverse  fucking retard
  interesting im gonna have it in consideration ty very much anon
pathetic selfbump
  as an example of how the nt motivates the otthe ot contains a detailed ritual process of what a leper should do if his leprosy subsides this is very boring by itself but when jesus heals a leper and tells him to shew himself to the priests he is referencing this process in jewish law
cover to cover obviously anon    skim genealogies when they show up and numbers/leviticus or you will get tired of some chapters the only genealogies you should know are jesus from the gospels which you will recognize if you read the ot first and you cannot read the nt before the ot and the cultural descendant houses of noah shem japheth and ham    you will have to reread the prophets after the new testament so dont get hung up on cryptic verses    god bless and good luck anon

prev thread     kicking things off 1/2    on a strawsmelling gust elgin dodd comes passing through the doubledoors dodd is an aging man and is almost baldheaded were you closer he would smell like a hay bale and also were you not so far away you would see that hes the size of one contrary to his saying otherwise as he talks and shakes their hands as their guest he hasnt come to worship or to enjoy the fellowship or even to hog all their supper though he says these and he means them and though he well plans on worshipping a little enjoying a little fellowship and hogging a threeorfour plates these are none his calling it isnt the case that dodd is just poured with contempt for these so dont be confused as a matteroffact now in his worshippings defence dodd likes rising each morning for a prayer at six oclock before he sets his coffeepot he prays most times on his mother who has passed on the weather and on the government since two of those three are considered public weather and government if it needs saying he feels safer would the answers bless a larger number than himself and he fears the answer on his mother who he loves he always wishes her happiness in heaven and onthehour it seems he will fold an embroidery over or will mistake the cabinets and see a china piece and that sort of thing causes him to think of her and each time he does so in a friendly manner a little gentle smile on his lips but he only prays on her because he must were his prayer on her answered he feels that because she already resides in paradise and thus cannot be further blessed the answer would only bless himself and so that would feel selfish and unholy the question bothers him and also its often the item when he prays before bed because as said should he not pray for his mother then he would not honor her as commanded but should the answer bless only himself then the worse he would fear the judgment come upon him so certainly dodd worships with fear both selfmade and good now in defending his enjoyment toward fellowship his particular ministry calls him travelling to as many houses and churchboxes as can stuff him in and in that as it only follows commonsense he has met and has gotten to know a kings courtfull of poor people preachers and teachers nurses and nephews loud talkers and walkersaway fellow evangelists crooks wherever hes guest dodd will earn a friend though his ministry as often as it calls him to it also just as often calls him off but so his friendships do not last and otherwise they will flicker offandon then without reason one day and just like bad bulbs they are shot and hes tripping in the dark it isnt the case that dodd shows others neglect or acts rudely toward them he isnt too zealous either nor does he annoy them with grief nor with hints of desperation but hes friendly and good at laughter

  here is the first page about of a short story im writing    well just have to sell him i remember my mother saying with finality it will be a long winter and i will be alone here with only these children to help me besides he eats too much and we will not have enough feed for the cattle as it is  it is the second saturday of november and already the sun seems to have vanished for the year each day dawns fuller and more glowering and the waves of the grey atlantic are sullen and almost yellow at their peaks as they pound relentlessly against the round smooth boulders that lie scattered as if by careless giants at the base of the everresisting cliffs at night when we lie in our beds we can hear the waves rolling in and smashing rolling in and smashing so relentless and regular that it is possible to count rhythmically between the thunder of each one one two three four one two three four  it is hard to realize that this is the same ocean that is the crystal blue of summer when only the thin oilslicks left by the fishing boats or the startling whiteness of the riding seagulls mar its azure sameness now it is roiled and angry and almost anguished hurling up the brown dirty balls of scudding foam the sticks of pulpwood from some lonely freighter the caps of unknown men buoys from mangled fishing nets and the inevitable bottles that contain no messages and always also the shreds of blackened and stingy seaweed that it has ripped and torn from its own lower regions as if this is the seaso for selfmutilation  the pulling out of the secret private unseen hair
  each day dawns fuller and more glowering and the waves of the grey atlantic are sullen and almost yellow at their peaks as they pound relentlessly against the round smooth boulders that lie scattered as if by careless giants at the base of the everresisting cliffs    slow down    we can hear the waves rolling in and smashing rolling in and smashing s  unnecessary  so relentless and regular that it is possible to count rhythmically between the thunder of each one one two three four one two three four  clumsy choose either relentless or regular  possible to count rhythmically is redundant  rolling in and smashing relentless one two three one two three    it is hard to realize that this is the same ocean that is the crystal blue of summer when only the thin oilslicks left by the fishing boats or the startling whiteness of the riding seagulls mar its azure sameness  slow down sentences like these tire most people out    the inevitable bottles that contain no messages  this is the type of idea you need to learn how to ignore
as i ducked the arrow hit the brick wall just above me i wanted to shout and interrogate him but the dark assailant was already nocking another shot instead i sprinted towards main street it would be easier to evade him in a crowded area especially one with plenty of shaded alleys and open shops a pounding began in my chest and my limbs went numb what if his next shot lands before i make it i thought even if the arrow hits me somewhere nonlethal itll slow me down too much to outrun him another arrow hit the brick wall behind me i chanced a glance back and saw the figure stowing his bow and drawing a blade the size of his arm he took chase faster than any normal human should be able to it was a wonder he had bothered with the arrows at all    pretty new to writing havent completed a real narrative yet so i figured i should focus on making my prose engaging any input helps

  the first sentence introduces action passes through the double doors which is followed by a very lengthy investigation into the religious character of dodd with nothing further happening perhaps it would be wise to expand upon dudd as he carries out further actions that emphasie what you want to say about him otherwise in my opinion this piece becomes rather dull quite quickly    you seem to have many interesting opinions about how dudd understands and behaves in his world but your opinions come rushing out like beer from a split can id like to see better use of pacing alongside some development of the story how can you expect the reader to be interested in dodd without getting to know more about his relatable qualities first why should we care when he doesnt yet belong to a narrative
  well just have to sell him     who is him so many words and the reader has no idea who youre talking about it doesnt seem wise to me to introduce tension right at the beginning without resolving it or even hinting at resolution theres no point in writing an arresting opening which i admit it is without guiding the reader along as if he or she has a chance of understanding     otherwise id like to point out your unusual and distracting use of grammar i dont think you use enough of it maybe you would do well to pace out your descriptions i feel like this piece leans heavily on description of the setting  in this case the atlantic  and not nearly enough on why your these descriptions are relevant to the story in fact it doesnt at all feel as if youre trying to tell a story instead it feels as if youre looking for an excuse to show off your metaphorical skills without any tangible basis to connecting with the reader why have you desribed things so precisely is there a deeper reason that adds to character or story perhaps the joy of describing has overshadowed the task of telling a story
   what if his next shot lands before i make it i thought    your choice of language distances the reader from what is really going on  in a sense you write with urgency then destory it by consolidating with i thought the reader is thrust from the present into the past     otherwise i cant help but wonder why on earth the narrator is running in the first place should i symphathise or should i feel glad that this individual is being hunted down like a feral pifg on a newlyinhabited desert island     please add more context into what youre saying without it theres no reason for anyone to give a damn whether this character lives or dies
  i explained i havent written up a cohesive plot or even imagined the characters appearance or personality i just imagined a situation where someone was being attacked and tried to make the prose engaging enough for one to read through when you say the i thought broke the urgency though do you mean i should remove it altogether or rework the tense of the paragraph itself
  youre doing yourself a big favour by writing before formulating a plot or having developed characters  as far im concerned the best way to create is often to make it up as you go along     that being said as a stanger and total outsider to the weird outerrealms of your imagination without a cohesive engaging plot theres no reason why i should invest in your character    its not a proper criticism sure but what can you expect on a balinese embroideryappreciation messaing board and i happen to be highasballs     i think you should rework your tense stop pussyfooting around and decide whether youre being in your face or a more senisble distanced oberver in the third person

  its a story that is already finished and im redrafting it but ive put a lot of work into crafting the opening and im just posting for critiques    thats fair that i dont mention who the first line is referring to ill think on it i do feel that its heavily implied by the dialogue that it is some sort of animal the characters are in a rural and blue collar setting so there really are only so many things him could be referring to     its a story about a family living in nova scotia the father is a blue collar worker who owns an old horse he used to work with when he was a miner and the mother wants to sell the horse because its useless and old while the father doesnt out of love/sentimentality the story is about that conflict and the harsh conditions that they live in which make some people tough and hard the mother and forces others struggle to hold onto their more empathetic nature the father all written from the perspective of a boy observing his parents considering those general ideas i felt the descriptions of a harsh and unforgiving environment were an important part of setting the tone and foreshadowing the coming themes

the boy and i remained in the prosaic world or so it appeared my brooding soon gave way to functions of fatherhood we were guests i could not allow this toddler to wreak havoc in my teachers cellar yet one cannot keep a childs curiosity in check for long i allowed him to peruse the room to examine the wire waste bin to fiddle with the desk handles my mind raced with thoughts questions that i would pose to the oracle they were naturally faustian questions regarding origins meaning the fabric of space and the abolition of time the details remained vaguei would know once the moment came the boy being more aware than myself turned and led me through another door that i had not noticed earlier the spartan look of the soldiers quarters gave way to oriental splendor akin to a mediterranean courtyard or a pashas garden despite his young years he certainly took notice of the opulent scenery it was a true feast for the eyes the blue and white iznik tiles exuded a natural charm that worked to lull me into a state of temporary tranquility i could have lost myself in the opium air the boy detecting a faint bubbling sound made his way to a stone fountain that stood in the center of the plush pleasure palace i allowed him to dip his hands into the cool water it was inviting almost insidious and i struggled to keep myself from doing the same after the novelty wore off i had to restrain him from diving further into the poola sopping child would certainly ruin the moments aura upon ks return amidst this struggle another door appeared on the far side of the room this time we both noticed and i took his hand as we proceeded to approach the obscure opening with caution as we neared i saw a long open staircase extending into a cavernous space it was dim dusty not unlike an aircraft hangar or an old foundry some distance down the staircase there were gaps missing treads and no banister to speak ofa treacherous descent into an empty underworld even the boy could sense the danger it was palpable as if the space threatened to swallow us whole was this bizarre feature permanent or just an illusion could this place be a figment of the imagination a hall of mirrors or an artificial world of anothers making perhaps i was indeed the subject despite being left in the anteroom i shuddered pulled the boy away from the sinister void and returned to the captains office

  quite a nice standalone passage upon my brief read is it some kind of lolitatype story but with a little boy lolito
  tell me more
new to writing read araby and wanted to write something love related heres what i have so far appreciate any critique or feedback does it move too fast     the first thing i noticed was her scent strawberries mixed with sweet perfume that was it she leaned over over the chair licking her top lip to moisture it and i was smitten by that action absolutely smitten     hellooo she said staring into her textbook not looking at me    it broke me out of my trance     oh sorry no i dont know where the math class is i dont know why i said that i knew where it was it was as if my tongue was tied into knots     thats okay she murmured but there was something in her expression that told me it was not okay her face was tense     somehow she must have found the class as she was already there when i walked in she shot me a look full of disgust as if i had deliberately kept a secret from her my heart felt heavy as i sat down in the chair behind her it was like being pulled down by heavy stones black and dark as the night     i couldnt concentrate on the lesson the numbers mixed in the air and fell down before me the fluorescent lights white and faded out fell on her smooth brown back and the bottom of her neck the shadows created images which occupied my mind as the class bore on the teacher called on me but i was lost lost in a maze of adoration and obsession he called me an idiot out loud she laughed along with the rest of the class i was an idiot i was     when the class ended i waited outside she too waited and then she started walking home i watched her go by my heart beating in tune with the swish of her dress and her soft hair tossed from side to side her feet whispering against the ground she was floating and so was i     for the next month i sat behind her in class and waited outside till she left i couldnt talk to her i had placed her on a pedestal and in doing so had put her in a place where my reach couldnt extend but i had to try
  moisture  not a verb     hellooo she said staring into her textbook not looking at me  this is quite unintuitive  why doesnt he look at him when asking a question    the fluorescent lights white and faded out  i dont think fluorescent is a realistic description and im not sure faded out is typically a phrase used to describe light    she too waited  why    swish  ive been close enough to hear a dress swish    black and dark  redundant phrasing    her feet whispering against the ground  i actually find this description funny when i imagine it im not sure you meant it to be    grade  c    got some events going on but nothing significant or interesting a dramatic event or occurence with real consequences for the characters would be nice just entering and leaving class maybe id like to know more about her all your descriptions of her are pretty generalised and could be any non descript person and infact all your emotional descriptions are tied to specific events not bad but it makes the character/s feel abit hollow why does he like her how does he feel even though its in first person your main guy is completely passive when the point of first person is to have a deep personal insight into them if you wrote a diary it wouldnt be passive like this would it
messed around a bit with the sentence structure tried to break it up a bit more id love some feedback
1/2    the beginning of a short story im working on well aware of the heavy use of adjectives and adverbs just throwing everything on the canvas to begin with    my acquaintance and i met on the first snowy night of the season at a dinner party hosted by our mutual friends the esteemed governor and his wife i wish hed shut up soon had been my thought for some time as i politely sat sipping my schnapps he was raving on and on about his dearest anna and i was finding it increasingly difficult not to throttle him from across our little table i kept composed though nodded along and smiled endearingly at his every remark but inside i was beginning to boil who was this scoundrel to brag of his dearest before a lonely bachelor sipping schnapps at a dinner party and with such a scoundrels nose indeed      it began like this      picture i quietly indulging in the cocktail shrimp at my solitary office in the corner of the dining hall a waltz is being played on the piano the gentlemen are smoking their pipes and their wives are all in a flock near the hostess with her exquisite red dress puckered lips and enormous earrings she stands out amongst the ladies and looks more like a dream consort than the wife of that burly old man the governor a jovial air of chatter and laughter hangs over the party and beholding the high stacks of pastries and sweets that had just been laid out on the table in the center of the room i am perfectly content in my own company      presently enters our devil in question after surveying the party from the entryway he catches my wandering gaze at first he acts as if caught offguard his shifty eyes darting left to right in a clear mockery of suspicion but i must have been of peculiar interest to him for he very quickly begins slithering towards me through the crowd judging by the devious grin he now bares across his face  one which looks to suggest a secret intrigue or an inside joke  i realize this will not be an encounter i can easily avoid     imagine us was his grand introduction two handsome young gentlemen of the highest standard health and grooming with the whitest of teeth and a full head of hair here alone at a society party with neither of us a date by our side whats your excuse      he sat down promptly across from me plucked a shrimp from my glass and popped it into his mouth he wore a long elegant frockcoat fine leather boots and donned on his birds nest of curly hair a black top hat which he was evidently very proud of by the way he delicately caressed the brim between two spindly fingers his face was waxy and unusually handsome but had the disconcerting quality of a mask i mildly suspected he was not actually on his own here but it was of no consequence to me      im just here on invitation was my response a lie     whats your relation to the governor he asked     a distant nephew another lie
  thank you for the feedback and critique i will try to act on the things you mentioned and improve my story but fluorescent lights casting a white and faded out shade  feet whispered against the ground are things ive read in books
    2/2    he leaned back in his chair and scrutinized me closely ah well myself just out to enjoy the evening i really know nobody here with that he gave a wink oh but look the snows already beginning to fall     we turned to look out the window across the room and indeed outside soft thickets of white snow were falling gently from the darkening sky      its sure to be a wonderful night he said one might fancy a stroll through the streets if one doesnt find oneself bogged down here with this unruly bunch for too long     a little chilly for me i said     he began musing if only my dearest anna were here isnt it a sweet thing our love if only you knew on a night like tonight with such a moon in the sky shed start us off the couch with a little tickle under the arm as she usually does when some whimsical fancys got ahold of her senses and well you know women and so on
  yeah ure right bout the lights i still dont like whispering though ha never heard that before sounds funny
  whats this about erotic fiction
  anyone who speaks spanish willing to crit mine anyone
  this is just the exposition but i wont leave out the possibility of gay sex
the steeple peaks high and pierces still blue  and i undeserving of it peak too  but the wound bleeds out a flare of light  and in a moment my day returned to night    literally a little something i wrote on the spot walking home from uni one day short i know but feel free to rip into it
  i like it but it lacks a unique voice but that said if youre new to writing i wouldnt worry the more you do the more youll find one    also dont like the paragraphing dont know if its merely how its laid out on this website or not idk    otherwise good stuff my man
this is a lil something i wrote up not too long ago    some anon provided good feedback and another said that my first line is already in use elsewhere but i cant remember where from
  should note i forgot to make the suggested changes by the other anons so this is the old copy
  the biggest meme book on the board

bump fixing to post somethign here soon
despite the darkness the atmosphere in the bar was at least as sweltering and even more stifling than the outside three dim dusty lamps lined one long wall of the narrow room and a large redandblue neon sign hung offcenter on the other an old wooden counter once brown but now nearly black with the grime and sweat and dirt and spilled drinks of many years bisected the room lengthwise and irregular stools sat beside the counter at regular intervals a single patron occupied a stool near the back silent and unmoving as if a permanent fixture cigarette burning in his mouth like incense
  peppered with little errors thatre easy to fix i only read the first page but so far dont get the satire i dig the creativity in it though
  that first sentence is overwritten man you must find some way to center yourself and become more secure    also i have no idea whats goin on in that first paragph no clue
  it was as if my tongue was tied into knots    cliche ass nigga
  avoid accidental rhymes hate/late they read really weird    also stop trying to write like its the olden days    bereaved  i think youre thinking of bereft which is still too old fashioned    the days they passed    omit they also the day month year thing is kind of a cliche    he was smothered  so much passive voice    tenderly  try to omit adverbs also love me tender is a kind of cliche also shouldnt be a comma after tenderly    shed shame him much    look just read it all out loud ok read it out loud and if its really hard dont even write just speak the story out loud without trying to sound like anybody and write that down dont get so preoccupied with polishing something into an immaculate jewel you need to get the basics more down sorry
  probably the road     thrice for me   let her be    the most godawful feminine rhyme i have ever seen idk man not my kinda thing but i dont get poetry
  widen pupils    dude the poem is so good except for this am i missing something this is actually good i liked it and i usually hate poetry too so bonus round thumbs up    i actually read it out loud but wtf is widen pupils
  why should darkness be opposed to stifling and sweltering why should the counter bisect the room that means the patron area is the same as the area given to the bartender thats nuts    irregular stools sat beside the counter at regular intervals  dont know what irregular means here    cigarette burning in his mouth like incense  dont know what this image contributes    idk man it seems like youre trying to say some stuff but you dont have that much to say not that i dont think you have a lot to say youre just forcing it or at least it seems like you feel like you have to put details in where nobody asked for em    also why would you post such a short excerpt why get invested when the paragraph is already over just the same keep goin im sure theres somethin afoot with this guy try rewriting the passage from memory maybe
make it tighter make it fit she yelled as the seamstress weaved and prodded assembling the dress into shape she screamed at its whiteness at the light illuminating her from her disguise at the figure in the mirror they would gather at the altar soon her mother her johnjohn would kill her mother would never forgive her she cried as the sempstress pulled at the tulle snipped it with acute precision sundered the pieces to tie up in appropriate shape she gasped as she saw what she had become at the ivory walls surrounding her suffocating her reminding her of the irrecoverable virginity lost to her forever  she wept as the seamstress confessed it could not be tightenedscreamed as the woman slashed the dress in her meticulous way her scissors opening and closing during perforation reminding her of that unforgivable mistake cries echoed as the dress was gashed as it fell onto the floor leaving a deep wound in her side her tears fell mixed with the escaping blood trickled down her body like a broken waterfall she sobbed as she observed her naked self in the mirror wept at her toned arms slim legs long neck at the bulging stomach which gave everything awaywhich would prevent her from entering the church as a virgin she looked at herself as she raised her hands bent them into clawsstared desperately as she brought them to her stomach and pressed hard nothing she begged and pleadedpleaded for the seamstress to lend her the scissors she left the shop ran across the road with the tattered tulle stuck to her uncovered self she cried and cried because the seamstress could not helpbecause the only option left now was the doctor  they filled stainless steel with utensils for her healing blood continued to flow from her sidesfilling her with satisfaction she would finally bleed on her wedding night this room too was painted virginal white they wouldnt tell her the timelie still girl they said she could hear johns voice soon it faded away where was her mother  an intense pain flooded through her making her cry harder than ever before she sobbed in agony in despair then in relief as she realised the disease would leave her body soon a cloudy haze spread through her tightening the open cavity as the doctor operated entering through her eyes her lips her nostrils she cried as she saw a hundred virginal brides standing next to her dressed like angels whispering to her to join them in their heavenly abode the haze grew as the pain seared her body asserting itself within the crevices she herself had created  she resisted as the angels grabbed her hands her frames calling her to them no she screamed people were waiting she had to attend her own wedding she noticed they were crying too the haze intensified the pain ploughed through her while that body convulsed throbbing and consuming her very being    pls critique not posting the ending cause hit the character limit
  you can clearly write but its incredibly difficult to follow and know whats going on theres little context to let me know whats happening within each segment partly due to the oversaturation of description and refusal to describe literally whats happening over the narrative    also the plot is unrealistic why the abortion now
  thanks for the response i appreciate it the reason the darkness is opposed is because the previous scene takes place outside on a very hot day its a sort of juxtaposition     i understand the confusion for bisect i didnt necessarily mean equally but that should be explicitly stated or another phrase should be used    i agree with your assessment on irregular as well    this is just setting the scene for two other characters that just entered the man at the bar may have a role but as of right now im undecided on it because i didnt have it in mind but it would be fun i guess
this prose poem is probably the first thing ive written that im truly proud of    program for the education of feral children  in your first year you will learn to slaughter and butcher an animal you will tear out their innards as the warm blood drips like tears and you will drink it like milk or wine from this you will grow you will hold the lifeless body in your hands and think of it as your own body and soul you will hear fairy tales but you will not love them as you should because they are spoken from the hoarse dried mouths of demons in your second year black bile will seep from your genitals and your heart will cut itself open the little girl you love as your mother will place her delicate finger in your wound and you will do the same as her father and the lyrestrings that make you whole will play and never be broken you will listen to the birds singing and you will think of dante or shakespeare or solomon in your third year you will be amputated and your limbless body will be placed on the assembly line and you hear the whirring of machinery and the thud of the sledgehammer and the gears will crush your bones and rip your flesh everything will be grey or gray as all will be sex without love luxury without sacrifice bread without communion in your fourth year they will parade about your broken body and you must not smile or wave because you must not submit or allow weakness to overcome virtue and though the black ugly faces will laugh and jeer you will still stare towards the sun
  bare in mind irregular stools sounds more like a medical term if you get me
held accountable    you know how the long strokes of traffic comb  the streets in stuttery fits  and how retractable the self is  and how our planet gasps for air  and how unrelated this first and second thing can seem  and the third one to the first obviously is  and then it is clear the second one too    well what if we could scratch and pick at the world like this  until all that remains is thin and transparent  and we look up through the dome and  demand some explanation for it all    but there wasnt any or maybe itd been  lost in a cracks of a leather sofa  where a tired carpenter fell asleep watching  baseball and dreamt of god

engage    hey joe i heard you shot your baby down bobby floored the gas dry sandy hillsides rolled by on either side of him their hungry peaks drinking up the light of the grinning yellow moon bobby caressed the steering wheel with a blooddrained hand if there was one thing that was always loyal to him it was his car    i love you bobby she smiled at him    bobby smiled back i love you too    what do you wanna hear    i want to hear her voice i want to hear her soft little snores in the morning beside me she is there at the end of the hallway the air around him feels viscous and he cant move frozen he tries looking into her eyes to find the answer but finds only a downcast sky over palm trees she waves her hand and turns away the lights dim from across the hallway and the blackness approaches him one light switch at a time a rumble growls low in his right ear growing louder louder until it is a roar a scream    bowie    the stereo always plays his favorite songs gets a kick out of it a real good time bobby bobs his head to blow the battered bloodied dreams away ground control to major tom lovely makeup beautiful figure like crescent green tea he could use some bobby takes a drag from the cigarette and watches the yellow lines on the road morph into a blur a yellow brick road now and he is the tin man driving down to see the wonderful wizard of oz and get a new heart one for each that hes broken including his own    no the road wasnt supposed to be blocked off there was no other way to go the cars headlights illuminated a large figure bending with his fat ass towards bobby while he placed the traffic cones down on the road he wore blue denim suspenders and a blue hat the man turned around and looked at bobby he had a round swarthy face with bad skin he adjusted his suspenders and approached the drivers window which bobby rolled down the swarthy man knelt and bent his face towards him
  youre trying too hard to come up with a unique name you stupid faggot god you are such a stupid faggot
  why dont you shut the fuck up
will trade a crit for crit  this is from a novel im writing i want to start this chapter off extremely cozy and wholesome its a story so obviously things will eventually get bad its a slope not a cliff also its from a female perspective  
walking through unknown territory coupled with the ever forceful wind and the words feeling feeling feeling still ringing in my ears was so exhilarating my mind was clear my world was at one with the real world everything was serene even when it wasnt    new to writing sorry for the short length just a little thing i wrote about my childhood       you write suspense and mystery very well hope you carry this on      really like the atmosphere and the main character do you have a title in mind so i can get a better understanding of what the book is going to be about
  i hate when men try to use their privilege to write about and dominate things they dont understand come back when you get your period

    my spanish is barely good enough to allow me to start reading in that language so i dont know what this is worth i like the pace the rhythm 1st person internal focus slow impressions one after the other that do not prepare you for the swerves at the end and the air of mystery  you may be a bit talkative though  highly readable for a story taking place in a hospital tense enough writing
short excerpt i banged out today        seems interesting the lack of information intrigues me the writing is mechanically tight the characterization and alliteration has no problems in this excerpt    but if the narrator felt the need to piss bad enough to nearly wet himself wouldnt that be a focus of why he got off the bus
  i find the lack of punctuation and capitalization a bit pretentious  the prose is good but im not the target audience

    i really like this it feels deliberate
  appreciate it trying to find the balance between terse prose and more poetic dreamlike passages maybe the wordiness comes from slightly ineffective images will def keep polishing on this tangent
back when i lived in monterrey i would go on many unproductive walks they said that taking taxis was dangerous but that wasnt why i chose to walk i chose to walk to count the dogs and not the feral ones that littered the streets in packsi had too much respect for those no i wanted to count the ones that the families kept on their roofs the ones that pranced back and forth on their raised embankments leering over the edge barking at strangers and sometimes when it got really late maybe around 2 or 3 am and the only other cars out on the trash filled city streets were the forest green military convoys id take a minute or two to stare directly into one of those dogs eyesany would do as long as the dog was on a roof i would whistle to get their attention make eye contact and then just like that be off to finding the next one why i did this im not sure id like to think because i was out drunk during those hours stuck having silly thoughts but who really knows
a journey of three days from the marshland where the air glows blue with fireflies and the water tastes bitter will bring the traveler to the shining city of niggerfaggot where all the chicks have humongous tiddies and gigantic asses and theyre all smoking hot and they want to fuck you but only when the traveler eventually departs as all travelers do does he realize that perhaps the only tits and asses that mattered were in his mind
  why would even waste your time writing that here its not even funny    see this is my problem with the crit threads
its been a while since ive been with a girl he said his strong hand brought me to my knees between his legs i looked up at him in horror but all i saw in return was a wicked grin   you did say anything healslut he said his words now stinging in my ears go on then silya tend to your tank  i tried to protest play dumb bargain dean just held me close to his crotch and brushed my hair smiling all the while  good healsluts do as theyre told silya he unzipped his fly pulled his pants down just a bit and the largest cock i had ever seen in person sprang out and hit me in my face suck it  i could only stare at the massive cock as it hovered above my head thick and veiny the head purple with anticipation and glistening with cum i tried to resist but felt captivated by the monster before me  im not gay i said  then why are you still here   both his hands were off me i sat underneath him of my own volition hypnotized i reached a tentative hand to touch deans cock it bounced at my touch  your hands are so soft silya he cooed dont worry were friends right just take it in your hands and play with it a little bit im sure youll come around  i took his cock in my hand felt its heat felt its pulse lightly daintily i began to stroke him one stroke after another stroke i slowly traveled the length of him again and again he began to moan and as it reached my ears i felt my own cock far smaller than his begin to stir again in my panties   thats a good girl dean said see its not so bad why dont you give it a kiss  holding his cock in my hand i brought my face close enough that my world became his scent his smell musky and sweet burned through my nose and attacked my brain i felt my eyes water and i fought the urge to drool i did want this id never wanted anything more i wanted to kiss his cock this is what i was put on this earth to do i was never a real man all these years of hiding in plain sight of blending in lead to this moment on my knees all dolled up with a real mans meaty cock in my face  i kissed his the head of his cock a small sliver of precum caught on my lips connected my mouth to his cock when i pulled away  much better he said before forcing his cock through my open mouth

  you think he actually looked like that or did the artist take some liberties with his stature
usual precursory bullshit lads dropping this with critique to follow in an upcoming post the quality of my writing doesnt equal my criticism of writing in others etc
  abab aabb bbaa baba maybe a sort of shuffling invoking a confusion while maintaining a meter   i like the imagery of the piece so far but without it being completed i find it hard to fully talk about it     perhaps the true tiddes and arses were the pals we found    i dig it though im reading it as somewhere going too far in the public domain and finding disgust i like it a lot having reread it it almost feels as if you can feel the blood rising in the authors mind as he wants to relate and interact with what he sees before being admonished    fuck glen osmond but im with you in nangs and wok in the box i like this as it feels terribly fucking immersed in the little cultural touchstones youre writing within something about the rhodesia and mandela war makes me think of in bruges id read it but judge you for aussie scum as i judge myself    colour me intrigued would be interested to see where this goes youve got a writing style that feels lacking in specifics which draws the reader in although it may be frustrating dragged out too long    i really like this anon i have no critique other than i want more     love it    as much as i agree with what the other anon said theres a lot in this to appreciate you clearly have an element of the singsong prevalent throughout and while the internal rhymes and antiquated language can pull a reader out if its not consistent it can lend to a very well affected air if carried through appropriately

hello /lit/ i used to write journal and even draw prolifically before i was hospitalized how do i get back into the groove of writing i miss putting ideas down on paper so much but i feel like something was taken from me
by not posting drooling frogs for starters
your willpower muscle has atrophied use pomodoro technique to jumpstart getting work done work your willpowr on at least one thing daily think about things that you enjoy and find intiguing and would like to explore through those media stop consuming stuff like social media youtube 4chan etc do a dopamine fast
  hospitalized for what
  degloved my penis from masturbating too much
  take some vitamin e daily and try to lay off if you arent trolling
like with all good habits you have to force yourself to build it set yourself a schedule deadlines maybe create a reward system for yourself to encourage writing more often eventually it will be just like showering or brushing your teeth a basic part of your life
whats the pettiest reason that has ever made you drop a book  for me it was once when i was reading a book in spanish see the imperative forms in spanish tend to end with a d while the infinitives end with an r for a while now in oral conversation people have been using the infinitive form as an imperative or alternatively using a blend of the two by substituting the d with an r and keeping the final article the same ex ordearlo instead of the correct ordenadlo  it has always pissed me off and one time that i saw that a word had been written that way in the book i was reading i got so mad that i swore off reading that book ever again
  primal fear  they made a few changes when they made it into a movie in the book the richard gere character was a hippie who dressed like a rebellious 15 year old   what made me drop the book was when an investigator checking out the ed norton characters background goes to a farm that has a few cows and a steer for breeding i realized then i was dealing with a take told by an idiot and into the trash it went
im probably going to power through it but currently im halfway through the powers of earth which is a libertarian scifi book i knew the author was an libertarian/ancap and that the book would have libertarian themes but i dint expect every character on the ancap moonbase to pontificate about libertarian theory to other ancaps on the ancap moonbase every single page otherwise good scenes of scifi action are ruined by internal monologues about statists  that the book one a libertarian scifi award tells me that the state of libertarian scifi leaves a lot to be desired
  i was halfway through gravitys rainbow when i lost it on the subway never felt the urge to get another copy maybe someone found it and was able to enjoy it
the big sleep because the narrator said some mean things about gays
  ordenadlo  oh un español
  best case scenario is a bum found it and used it to light a bonfire
  cormac mccarthy the road  it was my first try with mccarthy and also my last one i opened the book read the first page saw the way he was writing the dialogues closed it and then gave it to my grandparents never again
  i used it on my bum after a fired chipotle shit
post a better poem     protip you cant    when long ago the gods created earth  in joves fair image man was shaped at birth  the beasts for lesser parts were next designed  yet were they too remote from humankind  to fill the gap and join the rest to man  tholympian host conceivd a clever plan  a beast they wrought in semihuman figure  filled it with vice and called the thing a nigger

whenever i look at lovecraft i think of evolas face  whenever i look at evola i think of lovecrafts face  i wonder why this might be  i know these two men are clearly distnguishable yet i imagine them to be somehow similar  is it because theyre 1920s men  is it because they hated nonwhites  is it because theyd both wished theyd lived in previous eras
  its because they were both based and redpilled in a cringe and bluepilled age
