ill start    israeli backpackers are scummy  people in southern states of us are friendly af if youre white  japanese people are functioning autists  koreans are superficial overly confident and quite aggressive   thailand is modern day sodom and gomorrah
  germans are weird and somehow fetishize anything or make it awkward   scandinavians are the most clueless people on the planet in terms of traveling  europeans are the most asshole opinionated people on the planet and wont shut up about us politics  french are just pretentious dickwads and women are sluts  americans are loud  aussies are basically chinese but white  asians dont give two shits about their kids  never trust any chinese person
americans are fat as fuck
    got em
  the japanese are literally braindead  filipinos worship white people
  americans act like normal people then you find out they have a pastor or a church  israelis are aggressive  the dutch have one hell of an english vocabulary but never ever lose their thick accent  portuguese polacks czechs greeks dont get out much
  the japanese are literally braindead    didnt believe this till i saw it but how clueless the average japanese person is shockingly something slightly different than what is expected man they just dunno what to do
  being a white man is life on easy mode
  dutch people speak english better than americans or british
  dutch detected  you sound like this all of you but with a better vocabulary  
  thats why its so difficult to be friends with or even have a conversation with the japanese they are like alien robots instead of people
  israeli backpackers are scummy  ive met all sorts  i shared a hostel dorm with a group of israeli girls who were basically one of those idf thots pic i didnt get laid but they were great fun to hang out with    ive met some israeli guys who made messes everywhere didnt clean up after themselves and woke people up at odd hours
  im an american palestinian and ended up sleeping next to an idf soldier in a hostel in barcelona because im a christian and my accent dude had no idea until i jacked off into his duffel bag threw all his change he fucking carried all over the floor and drew over his israeli flag patch with a marker to make a swastika i was out of there before he and his jew friends got back lmao still one of my top 3 travel memories another was fucking an idf soldier on vacation in cancun she loved my brown dick shoved up her ass hahaha i now get excited about encountering israelis in hostels so i can plan some insidious shit im planning on carrying copies of mein kampf to leave on their beds on my next trip
  palestinian and isreali are really 2 sides of the same coin
  sure buddy only one side of the coin kicked my family out of our ancestral home and put all working age men into prison for 2 years they deserve every pint of my jizz fucking up their clothes for as long as they live i wonder whats easier to clean off those clothes palestinian seman or palestinian blood i want isrealis to fear leaving their little bubble theyve created
  this is like saying nazis and exiled french resistance soldiers are two sides of the same coin pali is doing gods work in any way he can godspeed to him i hope tales of his jizz strikes fear in the (((hearts))) of israeli hostel losers all around the world something as despicable as the presence of idf soldiers should not be normalized in the civilized world
  aussies are basically chinese but white    i really hate australians
  wow your a faggot
  they should not feel comfortable outside their hole
  the dutch have one hell of an english vocabulary but never ever lose their thick accent    you realize english is a native language for dutch people right they are taught english from birth and the netherlands has a higher english proficiency than countries like canada and ireland    the thick accent is actually just dutch accented english its like saying irish have a hell of a english vocabulary but never lose their accents its kinda condescending to judge our native english accent which is very unique and has been in use in the netherlands for at least 500 years    most people even dutch dont even seem to realize that the netherlands spoke english before england did as it branched off from frissian/dutch germanic in the netherlands before reaching britain    its fucking annoying to hear people say wow your english is great since its my fucking native language imagine someone saying that to a scottish person which is kinda the same thing
    dutch people are autistic
  surely dutch is the native language and english is just taught at a young age
  even if thats the case dutch is a very closely related language to english its a further divide than english/scots is but its closer than english/german or dutch/german
    even if thats the case  ur fucking retarded m8
  how do you mean clueless like always getting scammed abroad and stuff
  americans are horrible people
  thats not how language works at all retarded post consider killing yourself    t dutch
  japs are like manchildren
  cope the post
  filipinos worship white people  what does this even mean like do they literally believe white people are religiously on a higher level    please explain in detail what this actually means
canadians are the best love em
  israeli backpackers are scummy  lol
  just ignore him whioids are on eternal cope mode
  english is a native language for dutch people  dear god no
  netherlands has a higher english proficiency than canadairelandscotlandwales  not native  fuck off
  native means high proficiency    holy hell you just keep on digging that hole deeper
  okay explain to me how canada and ireland cant be considered nations with english as a native language
  muh shifting goalpost  explain to me where and how high proficiency is defined as native    native language definition the language of the country that someone is born in or native to     nobody swedish would for a second believe that they are native speakers of english so why does this here dijkfag you
  because the netherlands has been speaking english for centuries now and old government documents were signed in both dutch and english    people are taught english from birth and the language is given just as much preference as dutch during childhood its to the point where dutch people tend to speak english to each other because they are more proficient in english than dutch    english is a native language in the netherlands on the same level as dutch just like french and english in some canadian places
  people are taught english from birth  sort of confusing with that thick fucking accent then wouldnt you say  also people are taught dutch from birth the ones that are taught english are outliers
  english is an official language of both pakistan and india they have thick fucking accents end of
  dont listen to this obnoxious retard we dutch usually arent like this
  i hear you but were you born on the other side youd be glad of the same situation  also blanket generalizations never help and you are just reinforcing their beliefs
  based and redpilled
fucking love this dutch troll here im a foreign student in the netherlands and so far i have not seen such autistic humor by dutch people   in my opinion dutch have good english but in such a way that they actually have too high of an opinion on their skills and fail to improve their grammar accent and writing    moreover   germans are autists   russians know how to have a good time   not all brits are chavs but all chavs travel to a few european locations and shit them up   french are entitled and seem like assholes unless you know their culture and can communicate with them    muricans are just their own selves they dont make any effort to tone down their accents or discussion topics talk about american shit as if its relevant abroad too many especially western europeans suck up to them and pretend to be american experts due to the cultural exposure they get from there   sea backpackers are meme people
dutch here of course english is not our native language most children here dont have a bilingual upbringing they just learn english very early on not from birth english isnt an official language as well in our country
  disagree about the southerners boomers from southern states are not friendly to staff and cant handle the slightest hiccup ive neve worked in service but ive cringed more than once overhearing their demands for special treatment or the dumb shit they complain about they are so rude and talk so much shit about everything i dont know why they travel because they hate everything thats not like where they are from thankfully i rarely travel where they do but there was one time in italy it was so bad i felt compelled to apologize to hotel check in staff on behalf of all americans
also watching germans trying to handle schedule adjustments is hysterical
american who jsut spent 3 weeks in oz perthdrove the outbackyularacoober pedyport agustawarnaboolmelbourne     i didnt mind aussies once they heard my us accent they always asked where are you from and id say the us and theyd said ya i know that i could tell from your accent i meant where in america are you from    id tell them then theyd always have a story i went to american one time and went to xxx and yyy and zzz    only one old guy in curtain springs asked me about trump he was pro trump and fucking hated abbos with a passion that /pol would have been proud of     to call aussies white chinks is totally inaccurate everyone was pretty nice to me here ive been to mainland china a lot of work and aussies and chinks are nothing alike
 most fat americans are actually canadians that think they can do no wrong because they arent technically american        are french women really sluts i have had the least luck trying to fuck them in hostels vs anywhere else
  canadians are nice  arabs in arab countries are nice abroad theyre usually rich entitled assholes kinda like muricans
  i dont like israelis but the best blowjob ive ever gotten was from an israeli kike grill
  they dont make any effort to tone down their accents  i dont even know how to do that pretend to be english
  there are perfectly acceptable ways of speaking english that do not sound like you have your mouth full of foreign objects
  this
every thing youve ever heard about the chinese and chinese tourists abroad is true    europeans are all like 5 years behind on the jokes
  sometimes when im talking to brits ill say university instead of college to avoid any confusion so maybe that
  the jokes
  they use the phrase college in the uk as well also its not the same thing so yeah careful with dumbing shit down you might be dumbing it down for your own benefit
  not getting scammed but unless something is basically spelled out for them they dont really know what to do most the time if an event or time changes slightly off the set time its panic hour or if a location changes for meeting up its like a kid asking you why constantly
  i havent traveled much but the whole meme about america being god bless murrica luv mah guns praise jesus is kinda accurate but theyre still the friendliest people youll ever meet    thing that surprised me is that people still wanted to be your friend even if you were anti guns and not religious
  alternatively stereotypes disproven    canadians are good people who are very nice to meet when traveling    they are just americans 20
  im canadian but why the fuck would i try to change my accent to fit in with others
  they idolize white people kind of like how some suburban white kids glorifiy ghetto culture that and they see white as the epitome of beauty of perfection     inb4 whitey be fantasizing  im not white and i say this as an outsider
india is fucking dirty
  the dutch speak better english than brits or australians and their accents are often indistinguishable from your average american accent
  average american accent  that is a thick accent euros learn english english if they say ants instead of aunts something is seriously askew with how they have been schooled
  alternate reality  this is what most of them sound like  
frenchfag here what ive gathered from hostels in europe     israelis backpackers are assholes  aussies are generally top tier party people almost everytime i drank with aussies the night was crazy  german are stuck up no fun allowed  french people cant speak english for shit and are awkward because of that  americans like to think theyre aussiecool when theyre really just loud and as stuck up as germans although theyre generally nice  russians are scary theyre friendly but in a threatening way  italians are fun i dunno why i get along very well with italian girls  brits are trash especially the women for dudes its 50/50  spanish are trash and are on french level of not speaking english  asians in generally are robot tier oblivious to most social interaction
  german are stuck up no fun allowed    stay mad
  germans arent fun  thats because everyone came down so hard on them last time they had fun traveling
      fun fact jews love nazi shit every fucking time i meet them they are either doing sigas meake nazi speeches or draw/wear some hitler shit
canadians are so insecure of being confused as an american hence the canadian flag patches on their bags and constantly repeating that theyre canadian    americans are so uptight about beer pong if you dont play it their way youre doing it wrong apparently you faggots add the dumbest rules to a simple game of beer pong
  dont tell me we need to call it american beer pong now
americans can be nice but they are also retarded and violent like homer simpson
  im going shoot you for that we arent violent
  aussies are as annoying as brits and british women are the biggest whores russians demeanor and accent sounds threatening but they were always nice to me i agree about italians though im a victim to the mens charismaonly time ive ever been scammed was by an italian lol and the women are lighthearted and fun asians dont say shit and when they do its always autistic as fuck lmao also koreans love fucking talking about korea besides encountering them on travels i worked with a whole bunch of koreans and the level of love and delusion they had about their home country was off the charts they also told me korean women in sk wouldnt fuck me because im brown turns out that was very wrong
  as a korean i applaud and admire you for being able to bag a korean girl despite being brown
auschad here probably driving a road trip from la to vancouver across the rockies and back down    i know theres a ton of obnoxious cunts working the snowfields in canada    do i need to tell people im a kiwi
  do i need to tell people im a kiwi  pretty sure anyone on the west coast is going to figure it out fairly quick
  i ken put on uh decent kiwi accent whun i hev to
  its a common thing in the us to ask others where they are from/what they do i mean people will generally figure you are from overseas fairly quick given your responses restating it is unneeded besides youll get carded most places for booze so theyll find out that way too
  i think you misunderstand the question
italians were super nice fun and based
  americans are loud  dont hang around the blacks then  europeans are the most asshole opinionated people on the planet and wont shut up about us politics  im glad someone else said this i thought i was an intolerant asshole for believing the same thing
  most brits are trash but brits from manchester are god tier best night ever
  i thought i was an intolerant asshole for believing the same thing    nah its fairly common i found across euros of all countries the amount of times i simply ask where did you experience that who told you that or something similar it always triggers a response of the lowest level of uninformed not saying that a good amount of americans are any better with stuff but at least talking with them when they are wrong will admit it right there and then prove a euro wrong get some random response about how no youre actually wrong and this is how it should be because in my country of origin it is better but you wont understand anyways
  german are stuck up no fun allowed  its more like they have the weirdest fucking definition fun and when they drink have more autism then the board of mlp put together
  bavarians are godtier fellas desu you gotta go south to have a good time with germanics
  we think you are basically the same country and have the same stereotypes about both
  lol i was expecting it to be difficult but it really wasnt that much different than any other asian country most girls will be shy and timid and you cant be as aggressive as you are in the us or europe but other than that its not that bad tinder worked well and clubs even better i didnt approach any girls on the street so that might yield a different experience im a lighter brown person and have kind of a pretty face so that also might have helped getting a gf and meeting her parents that i knew was never gonna happen lmao
  i agree euros ego on intellectual matters are off the charts pathetic i had a french guy seriously try to start a fist fight with me because i called him out on a historical error and turned out that i knew much more about his cities history than he fucking did i destroyed this guys perception of himself and americans not doubt about that he couldnt take it in italy i was intensely studying tuscan history so when i offered to show the people in my hostel around florence and explain the sights/history an italian couple cussed me out and said i dont know shit because i corrected them on something as petty as the original use of the bargello and original roman urban layout these people seriously believe all americans are like those late night question videos and all euros are automatic conseillers on all things european
  i recall an article on how it wasnt that north germans did not have humour but their humour was simply so antithetical in form to our own
  euros ego on intellectual matters  i was intensely studying tuscan history  bargello  original roman layout    hey there eurotripper its not the 1920s anymore ernest and scott fitzgerald are long dead remember if you did not have euroshit to study intensely lel you would have nothing at all i bet you are max 22 years old and when you carry a book in your pocket you make sure that it is placed the right way so somebody can ask you about it
  hey there eurotripper its not the 1920s anymore     medieval tuscan history has literally nothing to do with the 1920s wtf are you going on about  ernest and scott fitzgerald are long dead    i dont give a fuck about fiction  remember if you did not have euroshit to study intensely lel you would have nothing at all     europe is a dead continent whos culture died in 1914 the contintent would be better if it was just turned into one giant open museum and contempory euroshits were exiled to some shitty island in the med to rot away they have produced and created absolutely nothing of value that isnt a direct copy of american or asian ideas and philosophy since that date people only believe you fucks have any culture because of high well preserved your architecture and art is dont be proud buddy youre nothing  i bet you are max 22 years old and when you carry a book in your pocket you make sure that it is placed the right way so somebody can ask you about it    nice projection faggot thank for you for perfectly displaying the exact euro ego i was talking about hopefully i wont run into you on my travels because i would hate to embarrass another dumb euro
  this is so american it hurts to read
  i recognize your ranting i didnt miss reading from you    europe is a dead continent whos culture died in 1914  and america is a fake country where any man made landmark thats more than 3 centuries belongs to a population of natives you have parked and basically extermined  soooo nobody really wins with your narrow conception of a peoples relevance
  literally nothing to do with the 1920s  no shit sherlock whoosh    rarara architecture and art nothing but dead hidahada    man your fingerprint is all over this post your bgrade intellect and faux intellectual namedropping has been noticed since months back europe might be dying along with the rest of the world except asia ofc but the put on intellectualism that you subscribe to is nothing but european you have nothing if it wasnt for this dead thing that you refer to nothing but trucker caps shit clothes shit suburban sprawl autotuned hits and hfcs ruined bodys obesity is normal for you if it wasnt for your fake attempt at memeing a heritage you would be nothing but a wannabe african american which in turn is another meme tribe but thats another story youre a puff of lukewarm air a queef from your white trash mom you could not trace your lineage even if your moms life depended on it you umpteenth generation of dirtfarmer you    also youre triggered lel
    hahahahaha you guys all triggering each other are killing me keep it goin yall
  americans cant recognize a kiwi accent theyll just assume you are australian also white south africans will be assumed to be australian
  bullshit lmao
  americans cant recognize a kiwi accent    oy cuzzie you rekon we shud hav us some kai before we get on the piss  sheerrbro let have a mean feed ya rekon we do some spots befo  hardbro sounds mean as
  the kiwi accent may be a little tough but the slang is pretty unmistakable
  if youre going anywhere urban hell yeah they are but youll find them in clubs around the city instead of hostels you know because they live there mainly talking about paris but theres certainly others with the same predicament    i just dont know why youd want to tho
ive met good and bad people from most every country but heres a list of basic trends ive come across     israelis are obnoxious and tribal   chinese backpackers are borderline autistic   australians are utterly obnoxious unless youre as intoxicated as they are   brits are sometimes okay and often aussietier     many americans in western europe and mexico are insufferable  americans in lesstraveled areas tend to either be chill and brotier or comically conceited    large groups of indian travelers have no respect for anything or anyone   solo indian travelers are always really cool or total tryhards   indian travelers in india alternate between being overly hospitable and having zero manners trashing hostels talking with their friends early in the morning switching on lights at night etc     arabs are usually sort generous but do indiantier shit like take phone calls in a dorm room at 3am     french people are either insufferable or very agreelable  ime french men are usually far worse than their female counterparts for whatever reason ive gotten along pretty well with most french women ive met but cant stand the guys     germans and scandinavians are attractive but are in the words of a female friend utterly vanilla dont have actual personalities or nonstereotypical interests  the 5 of germans with actual personalities and senses of humor are tons of fun
    also inb4 autists take this too seriously
  friendly but in a threatening way  merci beaucoup mon ami francais   je pense que cest vrai nous sommes intimidating in every day life maybe its that we dont smile or have much positive emotion sorry for the frenchlish i just dont know that much
  aussies are basically chinese but white    what the fuck are you talking about cunt
  les français sont connus pour ne pas être très amicaux au premier abord mais se détendent vite ça a longtemps été un problème pour moi mais je suis pas loin du stéréotype et je conçois quon puisse me trouver arrogant menfin 
every iranian ive met traveling has been an outspoken atheist thats extremely racist towards muslims and prefer to be called persian instead the women are extremely educated usually having masters or phds in their fucking early 20s but they only talked to white guests such as me and were incredibly racist towards muslims    israelis were fucking assholes to everyone and to me until they found out i am a jewish european which immediately led to them suggesting birthright in israel and them inviting me over which kinda left me with a bad tribal impression of them    japanese men are the most beta people on the fucking planet a japanese early 20s couple came into a hostel and some aussies straight up hit on his girl and you just sat there silently and eventually even left the room with his girl still in the common room laughing and drinking with the aussies felt like a scene out of a fucking cuckold porn    these were the most interesting ones but here are some common ones  everytime you see some freakishly tall dude or girl its a dutch person  british women are the most slutty people on the fucking planet having a british woman in your hostel means you have a allyoucanfuck buffet  americans are comically uneducated about the world outside america it has happened more than once that a usually valley girl asked how they have electricity in third world countries or why i dont speak european with other european guests americans on /trv/ tend to be normal people but holy shit every time i hear such a retarded thing its always said by an america how the hell do these people even manage to leave their countries if they have such little knowledge about the world
  americans cant even recognise an australian accent theyll think youre british
   iranian ive met traveling has been an outspoken atheist thats extremely racist towards muslims and prefer to be called persian instead the women are extremely educated usually having masters or phds in their fucking early 20s but they only talked to white guests such as me and were incredibly racist towards muslims  haha this well not generally very racist but yes to atheist persians with masters/phds  its because those are the ones that can get our of iran and being atheists who hated the islamic revolution they want to get the fuck out i met lots studying masters and phds when i was doing my own masters
  everytime you see some freakishly tall dude or girl its a dutch person  tallest race on the planet note even memeing      americans cant even recognise an australian accent theyll think youre british  this is a meme  americans are amazing at identifying accents probably because they have so many of them themselves theyre the only people who consistently pick my accent as shitposter even brits thing im a pom but yanks arent fooled
  americans are amazing at identifying accent  this is not a plausible statement
  plus you defilled a jewish woman if she wasnt already defilled before
  shouldnt have botched your invasion against the jews
  muh flawed perception of reality  zionism is the invasion there were but a handful of chosen ones down there in 1850  palestinian locals did not try to invade anything
  your description of indians and americans in less travelled places are spot on     i still havent met a single israeli backpacker neither here in india nor anywhere else    i dont really see how germans or scandis are particularly boring though i mean 97  of all people you meet will be pretty boring and have regular interests at least they have a personality unlike most east asians
  yeah and its destroyed by their hideous accent the dutch accent is by far the most annoying     dutch girl  why are you hiking in conversh allshtarsh
  i hate palestinians
  true in all my travels they are always the worst
  uncool hat that  hat is effay
lets see  americans are loud and like to pretend theyre cool but are in fact really stuckup  aussies are annoying and loud but fun if youre drunk  swedes can be fun but the men are conceited and beta compared to the women  turkish women are really nice to be around the men are always defensive agressive and just obnoxious in general  british women are quite ugly  germans are no fun  swamp germans are autistic  french are fun drinking partners but speak very poor english and seem to be making their own little joke everyone is the butt of constantly putting everyone on edge idk if thats french humor but its not pleasant  italians are bragards  probably all chinese people ive known would be considered mentaly ill for various reasons in the west
  fucking based
  in a meta and ironic way maybe on looks alone no way
  germans are only fun when drinking desu the whole night can pass by and they are fine but me im rippen
  ant or aunt which one do you want us to say ant like aunt aunt like ant are you being purposely vague
   in southern states of us are friendly af if youre white and protestant  fixed once they see a rosary they think youll infect them with your pope mind control
  frenchies are cunts  dutchies are cunts
germans really are pretty autistic and no fun also tend to be kind of robotic and follow travel trends ie where theres one german theres dozens  ukrainians are always 10/10 bro tier  russians are the best drinkers and tons of fun  spaniards are okay but very cliquish and loud  americans are usually very loud oblivious and obnoxious but quite a few exceptions
  dutchies are cunts  nope they just have this insanely autistic and sarcastic humor that gets confused with cuntyness
  russians are scary theyre friendly but in a threatening way  
  they are actually worse than americans cause they think theyre not as bad as americans     are the most asshole opinionated people on the planet and wont shut up about us politics  i had a strange encounter at a pub chatting to americans and australians all in good fun when the australians bring up trump and start badgering the americans about american politics something the australians didnt seem to know anything about except orange man bad
  be in hostel  chatting with german  outta fuckin no where so what do you think of trump  oh i didnt vote for him but he is doing some good things to get the economy moving again cant knock him for that my healthcare also went way down so there is also that  well trump is bad i dont like him  oh what policies do you dislike about him  i dont know i just uhh dont think he is very nice and it would have been cool to see a woman president  yeah but what dont you like about him or his administration  i dont know he just seems like a jerk dictator or something      these are the same people who want to talk shit about how the us is fucked though know 0 about anything us other than some 30 second news blip
british girls dress and act like prostitutes   this makes getting a prostitute unnecessarily hard
  agree on canadians they are surprisingly shitty people overall from what i expected  take anything super personal even a slight joke  complain about essentially anything that isnt exactly like the weather back home  clueless about anything and everything that isnt a big name  essentially americans but because they can flash the nationality canadian feel exempt from all judgement  slowest mother fuckers in getting from point ab  have even 12 drinks completely forget any and all social manners almost actively attempt to be an ass  if something is wrong during any part of the trip they wont mention it until after or its too late to correct it  need hand holding throughout a trip other wise they will just sit and do nothing
  based and simultaneously redpilled
      say that to my face and not online and see what happens
  i can confirm a lot of these in particular scandies they are so bland
everyone has different opinions and everyone gets offended when somebody has a negative opinion about their country  shocking
  palestine doesnt exist
  israel formerly palestine formerly israel)))
this thread is an uninspired listing of the most wellknown stereotypes there are out there lmao what a waste of time  dutch are tall  germans are boring and organized  french suck at speaking english  asian cultures are crassly different than the west  americans are loud and ignorant    no shit haahahaha /trv/ your travellers
  formally british clay  forminally ottoman clay
 israeli men are the fucking worst the women look like wonderwoman   japanese are robots   americans dont know shit about other countries   australians are fun but fake   south american women are smoking hot
are israelis worse than indians i fucking hate people from india with a burning pashion but ive been fortunate enough to avoid (((them))) what makes the joos such shitty people to be around also i dont need redpills i already hate the juden
  for me at least it is the fact that they act very entitled the whole burdened history and shit like they are the only nation that got shit on in the entire history has left a toll i feel in them justifying it in their minds that their allowed to be colossal assholes also they all love their little autistic country and will try to redpill you on it if god forbid anything about geopolitics or history or anything similar is mentioned
  americans are fun and good to hang with  canadcucks are nice but dull  poms are up themselves  scandinavians are always boring/weird  asians are nerdy and sheep  brazillians can be awesome but a bit generic  kiwis are scared of aussies and have chip on their shoulder  israelis do not mix well with others  italians often great guys french sometimes germans rarely  all other countries are shit tier and clueless

  whats your experience with indians outside india are they like chinese
  missed that part that makes it even worse though why the fuck do you care if anyone insults trump you cuck
be american  tell people when i travel i am canadian  get treated differently based on that      definitely one of the silliest things i deal with when abroad i will say though it is a hell of a lot easier to deal with shit since everyone is clueles about any canadian politics so that whole shit show is out it never ceases to amaze me how the instant i say anything about me being american the conversation goes to the following  what do you feel about trump  why dont you americans just do thing i have no understanding about to fix your countries issue  oh yeah i went to america i spent a week in new york city crappy time america is boring  why is it that you americans thing that i have no understanding of what so ever    though if i am canadian everyone just likes to talk in relation to what country i am in things to see etc etc
  christ  usually i take my time to explain to other nationalities that the size and demographic of the us is so vast that often states feel like different countries in themselves  so we midwestern flyover moocows do not think the same or do the same as a dirty south black guy
  i use to explain i lived in a state that isnt california florida new york or texas i just guess i am getting older because the same song and dance about explaining where my state is was too complex dont get me started on explaining to someone washington state and washington dc are not the same thing
  insulting people out of nowhere seems like the more cucky thing to do
  people in southern states of us are friendly af if youre white    3  btw can anyone tell me if its a euro thing or a spanish thing to eat fried chicken with a knife and fork it confounds me every time i see some euro tourist doing it
  nah that is not the definition of the word and it is also a red herring as a nonfatty why do you care if anybody insults trump
  the word means only what i think it means  ok tard in any case why would anyone not like trump hes not allowing mexicans in and stopped giving and to pakistan the only one who wouldnt like this is probably your european mouth and asshole thats gotten used to brown dicks
  you ever think that just maybe maybe the fact that americans just dont wanna talk about politics when traveling
  its always the same with brits who are middleclass fags pretentious quasisocialists or turbocucks with no spine for some reason i never deal with the same bullshit when talking to working class or stoner typesenjoy your dystopia fag
  why would anyone not like trump  maybe because they are you know people  brown dicks  case in point you cant even express yourself like an adult      no concern of mine also not real people     quasisocialists or turbocucks  dystopia  fag  that has no bearing on what i wrote but feel free to keep up your imaginary dialogue it might improve your vocabulary
  some of us are chill maybe stop speaking to people fresh out of highschool also theres nothing wrong with asking how the whole trump thing feels from the perspective of an american just like id be interested in hearing about a germans view on merkel or hear the perspective of a mexican on the whole cartel situation
  ccuck  you cant express yourself like an adult  case in point youre a brown dick loving tard
  i fucking hate yanks had a tinder date the other day and when i rocked up i realised she was a yank i just got up and left when i heard her talk complete fucking turn off
  vocal fry  or did she use the word like a lot  lucky you left before she started telling you about her relationship with jesus
  this also ive found that the dutch are among the most based travellers they always pop up in the most shitty obscure places and think nothing of it
    my great great great uncle and daughters 1895 ramallah
  the funeral of my great great great grandfather surrounded by his sons grandsons and great grandsons 1915 ramallah
  he was 100 years old when he died    my great grandfather threading ramallah 1930    my family were kicked out in 1948 carrying my grandparents on their back to jordan isreal rounded up all working age men and sent them to prison for a few years including some of my family who stayed behind my mothers side of the family had a similar story in bethlehem    in ramallah my family name goes back 6 centuries and i have a family tree going back two nothing left there any more
  how are you a christian now     also good job defiling jewish princesses
  some palestinian christians are still there of course in ramallah specifically it used to be a only christian and orthodox town for most of its historyit was founded by ghassinids rulers of the christian arab byzantine buffer state until the beginning of the 20th century with some muslims starting to come in the period from 19481960 most christians left some stayed in jordan some went to californiamy grandfather 1955 san francisco he ran a liquor store 4 blocks from haight and ashbury in the 1960s has some good stories lol some are in new york some went to brazil and argentina easy to track history because my family kept good records and lots of photos most were college educated and were teachers and professors some were arms dealers one of my great grandfathers was a train conductor for the british another great great great uncle was the first native ramallah to become a catholic priest
  orange man bad
      fake news  it was a country without a people  for a people without a country this is all photoshop  /irony
  found my family tree my great grandfather is in the circle
  they are intolerable they smell like shit they are cheap assholes who will hold a line up trying to haggle with a clerk who has no control over things they are dumb as a bag of rocks they smell like shit they act superior that they are in america because they made it out of shithole india they are just god fucking awful to be around plus they are creepy as fuck i could go on forever indians are the second worst people on earth easily the first if the jews werent undermining america and elsewhere
  a few months working in a south bay mall made me hate indians forever these guys even tried to haggle at apple stores lol
you guys havent even met the worst indians the lowermiddle class unable to travel anywhere abroad yet pompous enough to delude themselves into thinking foreigners traveling in india are doing it out of emvy respect and admiration india is nothing but a subcontinentsized septic tank
true stereotypes  spanish people are always in groups shouting loud things  french people smoke a lot  americans are either obamatier liberal elitists or friendly but super opinionated prudish christians  germans are super lefties and sexually deviant  dutch are tolerant  dutch food is shit  russians are racist and bigoted people  chinese are super competitive think very highly of themselves as a unique superior nation are super defensive of their country and culture and tend to stick together  irish are very friendly down to earth people  swedes dont have any peoples skills at all its like they are automatons    things that contradict stereotypes  french people are quick to admit faults with their country/society  dutch are not potheads  dutch are not super liberal being tolerant is different to being liberal  eastern europeans are actually very friendly people  refugees and immigrants tend to be educated or middle class people who have very similar western ideas about life  indians dont smell of curry or smell bad  indians are super nice very friendly people  indians do not prey on white women like creeps  russians are sometimes very cold sometimes very friendly  western europeans with exception of france spain portugal and italy are very elitist  so in some sense they are very prejudist even if they try to portray themselves as nonracist  eastern europeans are openly racist but then they are super humble in practice  south europeans are casually racist in a non serious manner and they are humble too  british cuisine is actually decently good    disclaimer these are just my experiences of meeting a couple of people obviously not reflective of whole cultures and societies
    thats what happens when you have mindless patriotism shoved down your throat from the age of 5 or so now you know how you americans are perceived
  you said smell like shit twice  i like to smell like shit
      you are talking about pajeet it slaves in india i want to know indian travelers outside india in sea they are cancer worse than chinks want to know how they behave in euro
i think most australian stereotypes are true but they all force it or try to contrive their image since australia is enjoying a meme status on the internet atm this was actually pointed out to me by an australian as well who i became really good friends with in japan basically they see all the attention their country gets on facebook and stuff like that and so they go overseas and try to act like crocodile dundee for attention ironically this guy had the thickest australian accent ive ever heard and was superifically the most like the typical australian stereotype than anyone i have encountered but yeah he basically pointed out to me that australians are desperate to maintain their renegade status in international social settings so they put on big obnoxious characters
finnish people are based deep down  britbong are okay  dutch are smug  amerifats are okay  russian are okay  chinese are very polite mostly  african are well u know
    i disagree somewhat i lived in the philippines for many years i do right now even there are many groups of filipinos like tribes they dont all feel the same about whites or even themselves id say the most common trait in filipinos is self hate the majority of them have huge inferiority complexes this leads them to envy whites rather than worship them all that nationalist bullshit youll hear them tout about how wonderful their country is and how proud to be a filipino they are stems from this too but if you talk about the shitty aspects of life here with people like that theyll begrudgingly acknowledge it    on the other hand if you wanted to say filipinas worship white dick ill hand that one to you its really true just dont be dumb and think if you come here every woman is just going to throw herself at you the ones that do are literal prostitutes normal ones tend to be a bit shy and aloof so you need to make an effort
  african are well u know  niggers
swedes outwardly liberal but secretly terrified of any grouping of dark skinned people  israelis so obnoxious with awful attitudes they can truly unite disparate peoples against them  chinese underrated chillest bros on some peach tree garden oath shit when not in tourist packs  sudanese friendly as hell with suspiciously perfect teeth  somalis xenophobic and arrogant to a such a hilarious extent it becomes endearing  germans always overprepared and dressed in orange jackets with extensive camera equipment  poles are fun drunks  new zealanders are pretentious and largely unintelligible even to native english speakers
  finnish people are based deep down    this is so true fins are quick to open up after a few drinks become quite keen to have a conversation the thing is too that fins a lot of us are genuienly interested in other countries and want to know more the occasional autism aside there are a lot of bros out there    t a fin whose lived abroad for 1/2 of his life
  if you have abroad half of your life are you really culturally finnish
  dutch are smug  its a misunderstood type of honor/stoicism its not meant to be condescending or rude but it usually comes across like that to people that arent familiar with dutch people    its basically a dutch version of australian banter
  based canadianposter
brits are great for drinking  americans cant handle banter  germans are most of the time socially akward  im german myself but meeting germans in foreign countrys is a fucking awful experience  israelis are really nice most of them will tell you how great berlin is  aussies are great to drink like brits  i dont see much difference between aussies and brits both are very pleasant  japanese are weird  hongkonges or whatecver you call them are great met one in spain years ago and were still in contact
  how can one post be both based and red pilled at the same time
  oh my god that sounds fucking horrible i was sure ive ran into the shittiest indians in my life but to think there may be even worse indians jesus christ given the choice i would literally nuke them     also  lol envious of india they cannot actually think that
  chaldean or syrian church
    you know all the people i met in india were garbage trying to cheat and scam you over everything the only decent human beings i met were the lower classes rickshaw drivers and street vendors anyone that manages to climb the social ladder in that country earns the fuck you i got mine attitude
  often states feel like different countries in themselves  thats absolute horseshit though obviously the south west is different to the north east the midwest is different to the south and peoples opinions change depending on whether youre in an urban area on the coast or a rural area in the middle  thats the normal variation you get in any country   america is culturally more homogenous than most european countries  compare london to the highlands or rural bavaria to berlin to see how ridiculous claiming arizona feels culturally like a different country to maine
from whats been said is it safe to say the average german is that person who has a instagram page filled with f grade level memes which they post daily to their 38 followers
  hongkonges or whatecver you call  honkies
  well considering i have friends and family whom i still visit on a yearly basis i would say yes im certainly not as autistic and way more talkative than the average fin but i think i still retain a lot of the customs
  based
  they just have this insanely autistic and sarcastic humor  thats called being a cunt
  most girls will be shy and timid and you cant be as aggressive as you are in the us or europe    its the complete opposite actually korean guys are aggressive as hell when it comes to nigthlife its common for them to just grab a girl by the wrist in a club and drag her to a table or to dance but apparently korean girls like that tons of western girls though complain about it when they go clubbing in korea
french are assholes
all this american bashing  im australian and generally antiamerican but to be honest all the americans ive met while traveling have tried really fucking hard to be on their best behaviour and not be a stereotype its nice but i also feel bad that they feel so insecure just because a specific time of american fucks it for the rest of them  then again everyone assumed i would be a massive piss head im probably an alcoholic by australian standards but everyone thought id drink a lot more
  french are just pretentious dickwads  idk in my experience they seem nice       brp       french are entitled and seem like assholes unless you know their culture and can communicate with them   this could possibly be true had a french guy in china who really rubbed me the wrong way until i learned its just how they are then i liked the guy
  youre a pussy if you are afraid to identify yourself as american think of how your ancestors who struggled to make it in america and build a life for themselves here would feel if they knew you were claiming to be canadian you disloyal cuck
  palestinian cope lmao
backpackers/realtravelers being complete shit people    come back into hostel if they stayed there before just to snooze in the common area or steal everything from free  supposedly okay with all kinds of travel yet staying in a hotel or using anything but hitchhiking is not experiencing the country  bro you have a cigarette hey man spare a beer can i grab some fries got any spare change dude  smell like shit constantly  basic conversations and questions usually alluded to direct answers   cant spend 5 dollars for a meal or quick shower somewhere yet their dslr camera iphone and other shit hanging from them  almost always 2535 still going to figure things out because the world doesnt understand whatever shit degree they got or flunked from  opinions on the world make 0 sense to anyone   asking about any of the places supposedly gone to results in a non answer with anything you can get off something like wikipedia or google nothing really specific about the area or time there  has to really drive in the point of what really experiencing the country takes and unless you did what he did you just are one more tourist
  she has a point only a moron would go hiking wearing what is basically socks with plastic soles  buy a pair of real boots you fucking sissy
  put dick in jewess mouth  come out circumcized  no thanks
  i am australian is the second phrase i learn in every new language after i am not american
  i live in japan and you have to understand that stuff really is spelled out for them in most cases like theres about 10 times more signage everywhere telling people what and what not to do in any given situation nobody has any critical thinking whatsoever whenever something unexpected or god forbid an emergency occurs people just stand around mouths agape like a zombie movie
  a japanese early 20s couple came into a hostel and some aussies straight up hit on his girl    kokodad
  yeah i looked into working in japan the amount of work i found out about how most tasks are forwarding emails around about knowledge base articles daily saying good job and doing meetings about the same thing over and over felt after a month i would go crazy if all i was doing was that as a sr systems engineer just forwarding and writing how to articles for people below me
  happy hanukkah
  hasnt met a single israeli backpacker in india  how spoilerwere/spoiler everywhere  spoileralso everyones right most israelis are fucking asswipes/spoiler
  i dont doubt it but ive honestly never met any im not in himachal rajasthan or kodaikanal so that might be the explanation im in coimbatore i like to think that this store is an omen keeping them at a distance
  agree on most of those  dutch food isnt shit though  and the thing about refugees is obviously not true
  nah its quite cool lol sounds like russian accent but better as an english person i see dutch as the master race generally except for their looks
  tbh i would be mortified too if a fucking american was more intelligent than me
forgot one from earlier    british people being just fucking moronic  complete drunks though it is fine if they do it anyone else doing it is an arse  bring up you are from the us and on vacation ahh you americans dont get holiday ya see we get a month off each year if you ask where they have been to pick one of 5 cities they always fuck off to  stand dumbfoundly in the way of something just staring whatever there is in front of them regardless if foot travel is flowing there  horrible with any kind of directions just the same way their time management skills are ass  there seems to be no way they can be rude most the time but everyone else should learn manners  anything and everything about another country is some kind of jokebut not really based off some stereotype the made up  have 2 volume settings mubble or loud up in your face oh fuck why
  hostel dweller detected
  nah most of the time these come from me relaxing at a bar after a day some tourist site or sitting around waiting for a train to come    brits in hostels usually just stumble in blackout drunk pass out half clothed in whatever looks like a bed
  warms my heart to see us even mentioned    t finn
  seriously do not understand this sentiment nobody denies that america contains a ton of retards but you have to be a retard yourself to not know it contains the greatest amount of the complete opposite types than anywhere else in the world the greatest collection of people smarter than you is in america alongside the greatest collection if depraved fat brain dead fags
  projecting this hard  this aint your personal diary kiddo
  dunno anon seen some youtube videos and buses of boomers pour into some streets around london completely shit up the whole place
  we just dont want to be confused with the country that needs to go invade another country every decade or so because our accent is so similar hardly anyone even canadians and americans can tell the difference
  yup you arent that country youre that countries shitty little colony much better ill rather be mexican
  happy hanukkah
      its a little israel in kasol himachal
  germans are super lefties and sexually deviant    what do you mean sexually deviant
    accurate a guy i knew who moved to america now tries to embody every cliche imaginable to identify himself his instagram is the cringiest shit ever    its usually inner city soft boys/ hipsters who do this too actual rural blokes are mostly nihilistic thuggish drug addicts obsessed with their shitty vehicles nothing to lionize     the reality is our nation lacks culture history and character all we have for the world stage is alcoholism and the larrikin archetype
  the larrikin is the character
  try living in palestine as a christian now buddy or better yet the gaza strip
  american women after the last election cant stop apologising to everybody for trump as if the world as a whole truly gives a shit about him  in general they cannot handle or understand banter at all and it never fails to amuse me when someone mentions the word cunt in banter and some american head turns in shock
  no need to wonder who is behind my post    more than 50k christians in palestinian territories schlomo
  americans act like normal people then you find out they have a pastor or a church    whats wrong with that
  because it is by definition delusional ie abnormal only primitive people do religion
  being so hostile to people who carry different spiritual beliefs seems more primitive to me do you also hold the same opinion of people who bring flowers to their relatives graves
  so hostile  after 2000 years of oppression and millions of murders screw you jesuslover your beliefsystem is a virus
    oh jesus christ i havent seen a fedora tipped this hard in years     wow man yeah youre a real enlightened global citizen
  2000 years christianity didnt get the ball rolling until at least the 10th century until then they were the minority getting stoned and whipped for believing in jesus   oppression of who millions of who are you apologizing for what your ancestors did to x neighbor nations or the natives of whatever country you invaded didnt think so not even religious myself but its fun poking fedoralords
  hurr durr fedora  lightweight retort 1/10 go turn the other cheek you faux enlightened one you
  my theological ramblings make a lot of sense in my mind  nothing you wrote there is even worthy of a response go hug a lion
  
  oh jesus christ i havent seen a fedora tipped this hard in years  not him but religious/ spiritual people are the biggest fedora tippers
excuse me its actually a trilby
  this
75 of american zoomers are narcs
  also they legit have no idea about other countries or world history
  unless it is drilled into their skull in highschool they basically are capped at that knowledge very few japanese are good at thinking on their feet dealing with situational changes or responding to something in an organic nature    shit has to be completely spelled out for japanese or they just kinda become literal children in terms of thinking doing spontaneous things or not on par with the routine is not something generally they handle well ive spoken with so many japanese when in japan about just doing something random for the fuck of it and they look at me like i rocked their world
    grug no understand ifferent  grug think they alien  mmmm
  have you ever been to japan or traveled with native japanese people i love the country of japan but by no means are the people there anything to brag about
  who said theyre aliens theyre insects at best
  i had a chinese foreign exchange student stay with me once it was similar  its like theyre not taught critical thinking or something
  as an aussie meeting americans half the time they do think im from england so when they ask whereabouts ill just say im from the southern bit
i hear you can save quite a bit on flights with the help of proxy location swapping post your experience using this method
bullshit
i can see how this might work because of targeted pricing  on the other hand paying through a proxy is super unsafe you are asking to get robbed
  paying without   why
      i actually do remember saving some money on tickets using the local version of certain websites while overseas however i also had my credit card repeatedly declined and had to pay foreign transaction fees
renewing my pasport atm should i buy international flight tickets from america before my new passport comes i found a really cheap flight to china and them korea in january that i want to lock in can i just use my old passport number to book and then change easily once i get my new passport
do they ask for your passport info at booking time i dont remember having ever had to do that for a flight ticket at most just a bit before the flight
  have you ever bought an international ticket before
  not samefag but this highly depends on the airline some dont give a fuck until a few days before the flight others ask you for the number during booking    i once entered a totally random number cause i was lazy to find my passport no one cared
ask the airline they will now what their policy is explain your situation ask what your options are    if you are worried about it dont give your real name     if you are paranoid about it call from a phone box
  youll probably have to update your passport number when you check in they might send you to a service desk to change it and then you have to go back and check in  when you get to the airport just go to the service counter before checking in and see if it needs updating youll definitely still be able to fly but take both passports with you to be sure
im considering going to caracas venezuela in january or february for only a day or two mainly just to see the final resting place of hugo chavez simón bolívar and others i speak spanish and look the part but i dont know anyone there    has anyone been recently
  lol
  how will arrange the currency thats the only problem in caracas and venezuela in general its not a war zone now
    sage
      thanks      yes thats a problem ill have to look deeper into have you been how did you cope with this i dont want to carry an entire backpack full of bills
you need to know people you can trust and can show you around and help you with money traveling in venezuela is no problem if you can guarantee those things i have been to mount roraima this summer and it was a cakewalk
  you need to have some friends in venezuela if you dont look latin and cant speak the language fluently and have no in the country already please dont bother its dangerous     if you just want to fuck cheap venezuelan hookers just go to colombia
    how do you get in touch with venezuelans who can help you out with money
  search for venezuelans in your own country
can you move to japan if you have anon recorded criminal conviction from queensland courts
are you a felon amigo
  a felon negates and you need an in demand gree like english or cs etc you cant just move there to work a meh job the market is already flooded in that area
  no you cant come to germany though and get free housing health education etc and you dont have to give anything back
  probably not  marry a man/woman with japanese citizenship
  have you been hooning anon
  yeah its pretty difficult to just move to japan have a crack at the working holiday visa which is super easy to apply for as an australian and see what happens     if you get it sick you have 15 yrs to find and marry a japanese girl if not plenty of japanese chicks in queensland so thats always an option as well     like  said getting a sponsored visa will probably be kind of difficult compared to entering into a loveless marriage but it is achievable depending on your profession     see you in niseko cunttttt
  plenty of japanese chicks in queensland    why is that my uncle married a japanese woman from japan and so did my brother
  a lot of reasons which are kind of difficult to explain basically boils down to     japanese people think that cairns is the capital of australia   a lot of japanese chicks just want to bone blonde dudes who are a bit built so your average shoeless ipswichian is basically 10/10 to them
  is engineering considered an indemand degree there
  engineering degrees are needed all over though you probably will need some kind of proof showing you can speak some level of japanese
different anon here    i studied physics only undergraduate though in aus and i havent been able to find a job was thinking what skills / degree would make me more desirable because i want to move to japan on a working visa with the autistic hope of snagging that marriage visa or have i fucked myself over by studying physics and not getting a 6 out of 7 gpa

  whats the best place to go/see around fukuoka/oita was planning on seeing beppu but thats all i have planned so far
anyone here use the 5 or 6 day jr flex passes bought one and going to use it soon when going over but the instructions on use are pretty vague its basically please show your pass at the jr window on days of use problem is i feel they are just going to do that stupid wave me through shit without stamping/looking at my pass some of the places i am going to as well dont really have staffed jr stations past the first morning and not again till the evening trains       anyone ever use these before
  they just wave you through they dont get stamped
  yeah i figured they just see the pass and wave anyone through had some wrong dates on a pass beforemy fault got the dates i needed to head to osaka and so on wrong i think out of all the time i used my jr pass it may have been checked like a total of once and that was on the nartia express train
  i felt like they checked it more for local trains over cross country ones kinda strange
  i felt like they checked morning rush hour trains and limited express trains in all honesty it wouldnt surprise me in the least if they just dont want to deal talking with dumb tourists and just give anyone the pass because explaining shit is too bothersome
hey guys amerilard here my credit card has a chip but no pin these days i hardly even have to sign the receipt     do those work in tokyo or is it specifically chip and pin only
  credit card will work just tell your bank prior to going to japan it will be accessed there so antifraud doesnt shut it off you can not get cash out on the card though a debit/check card would be required for that
  you want to use cash as much as possible but you standard card will be fine
yeah bring some cash most places will take card but plenty of places are still cash only even in tokyo
do you guys use any vpn or something for security on your laptop when you access wifi i want to work off my laptop in japan but have never done this before and am worried about my inputs/passwords/etc being stolen over wifi
  if youre that scared on security just rent portable wifi thing i dont really use a vpn because ive almost always just doing work at my hostel/hotel/airbnb not at the local lawsons my company has a vpn that i use if i need to do work shit but most my mail/signings are 2fa via text code so i dont really worry that much regardless
passed by mt fuji on the way back to tokyo from nagoya saw atami castle on the way read up on it and it sounds fun might check it out tomorrow
  stupid random questions from ameritard planning trip with friends    i snore loud  are pod hotels decently soundproof or will i be an obnoxious ass there should i just try to save up for a hotel for us hostels are pretty much out of the question as people in the room would need earplugs    my japanese is maybe 5 words  were all going to try to learn a lot more but what about a translator program i have two apps that can translate text typed or written if clear into another language would asking someone politely to read my screen for a question if were lost/want to ask a question be ideal    i hate flying  in my mind an object should not be able to fly 15 hours straight let alone a metal tube with people in it we had the idea of two smaller flights going to hawaii for a couple days then tokyo has anyone done that or should i get a prescription for some extra strength sleeping pills and just knock my ass out for 15 hours    also if i did somehow manage to sleep on a flight theres the snoring again is that at all common i assume there has to be some kind of level of sleep noise on that long a flight i dont fly let alone travel much so my knowledge of such things is that of a 5 year old    oh and last one hows economy class on japan air we were debating trying to look into business if we had some miles/credit card rewards though even in first class id be gripping the arm rest the whole flight in a comfy seat    apologies if this is all dumb shit but its whats on my mind now and im nervous about being unintentionally intrusive to other travelers thanks ahead of time if you do answer
   are pod hotels decently soundproof  not really   but what about a translator program  google is good enough learn the basic stuff like directions though left/right/down/up exit/entry where is x just in case    would asking someone politely to read my screen for a question if were lost/want to ask a question be ideal  should be ok   extra strength sleeping pills  maybe you wont need prescription for them unless youre a big guy that cant get kod with 3mg of melatonin which is otc in us    also brotip if you want to use your own headphones with the ife get one of those fuckers
  you can chech this list   or this one   most of it is fujoshit though
guys i used to be an absolute weeb in high school it was a dream of mine to japan and study abroad be a weeb find qt jap gf etc ive grown up a lot since then and i grew out of a lot of the japan girgugamesh stuff that i used to be into but i bought a ticket when it went on sale months ago and today is my last night in tokyo its been fucking awesome and ive really enjoyed feeling like a kid again for a week ive been shitposting in this thread for about 5 years and have just finally finished the bucket list trip that i used to post about thanks guys and if youre thinking about going on the japan trip do it take it slow because itll be over fast
im going to be for three weeks in japan during christmas and new years time i mainly stay in tokyo with some trips to akita kyoto nagano calculating the prices its the cheapest to get the 21 days jr rail pass    now the problem is it seems like with this pass i can only book seats once im in japan and got my ticket and i guess most seats gonna be booked out by then  im worried especially with trains to akita that i wont get there in the end or have to stand for 23 hours in the train    anyone with experience about this should i rather spend some more cash and bookbuy each ticket now instead of getting the rail pass    thanks for any help
had anyone gone to tokyo for a short trip and stayed in a park youd need some experience to do this but with the right weather there no safer place in the world to sleep rough sleep on a bench or camp
im going to tokyo this summer with 2 friends  i have a few questions  1 the company is aeroflot and i have 0 experience with them anything to look out for also we are going to have a 23h layover in moscow how quick is it to go through security and stuff here in charle de gaulle its pretty quick most of the time but slow down incredibly in rush hours  2 whats the best deal for public transportation we are staying around 2 weeks in tokyo and probably wont go out of tokyo  3 how are hostels in tokyo my friend is kinda worried about the whole staying in a room with 10 random people thing but told him itll be alright  4 when it come to bar and things like that is being 18 enough or is the legal drinking age at 21
  2  get a pasmo or suica card and put some yen on it its their prepaid card and you can use it everywhere in tokyo no need of buying tickets each time you enter the station     4  you need to be 20 years old most probably wont ask about your id but some do especially if you want to enter night clubs
  ive only had one instance where i couldnt get a reserved seat due to it all being booked up but even in that case i was able to easily get a seat in the nonreserve cart not saying that you shouldnt worry and that youll definitely get a seat one way or another but i dont think itll be that bad either
    tsukiji market closed on 6 october 2018 with the businesses of the inner market relocated to the new toyosu market between 6 and 11 october
  aeroflot seems to be decent but i dont have much experience to compare what plane are you going to fly on their a330 ife is dumb as hell but the b777 one is much better security in svo was fairly quick october 3rd at about 5pm   when it come to bar and things like that is being 18 enough or is the legal drinking age at 21  the drinking age in japan is 20 but the only time i got carded 19yo was in donqui in shibuya never had issues in konbinis bars and even in nrt duty free
  glad to hear it lived up to the hype my dude go to japan was like the only thing on my bucketlist since i was a kid it was my first experience out of the country and now that ive gone all i seem to want to do is travel everywhere and see everything
  1 pods  they are good enough so long as they have a door most japs snore worse than anyone ive met though  2 knowing jap  speak clear english with indoor voices at all times use google translate for anything else most shit is in english for shit like menus checking in especially in main/big cities  3 hate flying  stay up the day before to adjust your clock to tokyo time talking pull a 24 hour up time when boarding pop some tylenol pm and pass the ever loving fuck out  4 air class   unless its eastern china most modern planes are big enough
  21 days is a lot for that pass are you absolutely sure you need all 21 days access to high speed rail keep in mind local rail is cheap as piss and grouping stops can save you to doing a flex pass or such     is 150 allows for flexible use over 2 weeks you could do 7 day after that for nagano/koyto just depends it would come out about the same as a 14 day pass in costs but add a lot of flexibility to it     it seems like with this pass i can only book seats once im in japan and got my ticket and i guess most seats gonna be booked out by then  doubtful unless it is one of the trains that run like 08300930 the reservation for a shinkensan seat is really unneeded i think i only have ever done it once on my dunno how many rides ive done at this point you just need to go to the back end cars that are unreserved and generally have seating just get to the station a bit early i think the only time i needed reserved was going to nagano early in the morning one time in the summer but your jr pass allows you to just walk up and get a reserved seat at the counter
is there a site that gives a checklist of things to do before/upon arrival    ive never booked my own holiday before at least nothing like this and i am a bit overwhelmed i am going for two weeks early next march and want to visit four cities and climb mt fuji as well    obviously trying to book hotels in each city train tickets make any reservations i may need as well as documents maybe a phone contract etc are all things that need to be done and given the language barrier id rather not have to worry about anything when i arrive    thanks
  2 metro lines a 72 hour unlimited pass is 1500 yen and so worth it jr lines are good a day pass is like 1200 yen or something they just have fewer stops and are a bit more direct to hubs metro is a bit more slower but not that much still gets you to all the places you want to go  3 great i generally stay in them as my perferred method when going about the country to meet people save money and such most all have lockers or some way to put a bag in a secured area  4 you need to be 20 to drink but unless you look highschool most wont know for convenience stores you just hit yes i am 20 thats it clubs will card bars may depending on where it is/what it is
  is there a site that gives a checklist of things to do before/upon arrival  use japanguide cheapotokyo and make a check list in google sheets or excel for things to do based on a am/noon/pm for days airbnb does have some expirences you can pay and sign up for but a day of researching on the sites i stated should give you a good idea of where to go and what to do    climb mt fuji as well  you cant climb mount fuji in march has to be late june to mid september otherwise still too cold and snowy    train tickets  jr pass for major city to city travel metro day pass/suica for within the city  hotels  check hostel world to save more cash but usually look for apa hotels as generally cheap business room type stays  given the language barrier id rather not have to worry about anything when i arrive  unless you attempt to go to a really remote area most any city with tourism will have enough english there to get by on ordering food/checkin to hotel/get into an event etc
  thanks i really ought to have known about fuji but it has fucked my plans somewhat i was hoping to climb it for my birthday better to not climb it than die on it i suppose    i think im probably overthinking things im just a little bit anal about planning things when im as laid back as can be but i just like to know ive done all i need to    i get that language is probably not as much of an issue as you might imagine i just meant more in terms of if i need to do any paperwork or anything when im there i assume i dont but as i said im much happier landing somewhere knowing i have nothing to worry about
  thanks for the information you are right i might should recalculate especially since i do the shinkansen trips within the first 14 days then its only tokyo
one question when making a transfer from one company to the nexts train line within the same station what am i supposed to do i know youre meant to use your ic card to leave the first company area and go next but im not sure where to do that at i couldnt figure it out at uneo station last night and i was so burnt out from the flight and getting from narita i just decided to walk the three miles to my hostel     a transfer like this is what im wondering about
  there will be signage for this stuff and even if you fuck up and take the wrong exit you will only lose 10min assuming the absolutely worst case going up to the surface and then entering the other companys section
  i rarely weigh in on the japan general but matsumoto is bretty based was there for 3 days and cant remember what i did there but theres a particularly good ramen place there that i ate at every night
  find a train station where then shinkansen passes through and dont mess up the timing for stepping off the platform
do you guys travel to japan by yourself or with friends im finding traveling there less enjoyable lately since my friends there that i visit are usually busy with work
  yeah its pretty great  nice castle you can go in still original parts in/around it  virtually no tourists aside from you and maybe just enough you can count on one hand  wasabi farms  cool ass musuems   takayama a day trip away through the alps  amazing open air hot baths  cool ass zoos and wild life places
  i usually go and stay solo but still like to meetup with friends for things generally traveling solo is my cup of tea because i never have to wait on someone who might be dragging their feet sleeping in because drank too much or cant decide what to do
  it probably doesnt help that i dont normally leave my house much or at all so that behavior ends up extending to my vacation as well theres a shitton to do in tokyo but sometimes i dont even want to go outside having other people there is more motivation
  that said the outer tsukiji is still open and thriving i was just there obviously that big sushi place is gone and the fish sales have moved to toyosu but theres plenty of amazing food still at the old location
yeah the old location is still going to have a lot of things going for it at least until the olympics the new market has shops and is way cleaner
    thanks mates    i only mentioned prescription strength because my kidneys work overtime and flush painkillers/meds/novocaine out of me like nothing i suppose sleep deprivation  sleep pills should do some work otherwise a sleeping mask and noise cancelling heaphones    for a more artsy person are the museums worth it something like the ad museum or the nezu/idemitsu     i also like to draw and sketch from life is there some cool stand out spots or is that too random and i should just see if something happens to stand out
  museums are generally like 600800 yen for most of them the cost is a lot lower than most places i have been just keep in mind more foot traffic at them     if you draw or sketch just make sure the area you are doing it at is out of the way of main foot traffic and you arent drawing people they tend to be a little ticked by shit like that
    3 girl rotational system  how do i get this in my life
anyone ever get a loan from yakuza or some loan shark
  get some money you begpacking fuckwad    its so fucking disgraceful to spend all that money on a plane ticket than live like a homeless reject of society
will they let 19 year olds into night clubs specifically mogra and just not let them drink or are they banned completely from them
i went to tenga tower today on a suggestion     what in the goddamn did i just witness
  what did you do there i know nothing about traveling or japan that much but i want to live there i just wish working wasnt as bad as people say
how easy is it to get a japan visa
  where are you from it really depends  like some countries require collecting and providing some documents   nuke dropping (((allies))) dont need any visa
  usa
  usa  nuke dropping (((allies))) dont need any visa  no visa necessary  a visa is not necessary for us passport holders visiting japan for a shortterm stay of less than 90 days with the purpose of tourism and business  
  i just need a plane ticket
  yes and passport
  not including those how much is a standard trip to japan for i dont know 2 weeks
lot of the japos go gaijin hunting overseas but find little interest and get left on thr scrap heap my sensei at the moment did that and she now hates all white people buy loves her friend half american baby 46 no kids works 10 hours a day
going to tokyo for 6 days in early feb  really having trouble selecting a hostel    right now looking at  grids  akihabara    wise owl    imano shinjuku      wondering if anons have some other advice  4 males 1 female mid twenties and trying to stay centrally located/near a rail line  the guides posted on the header say try to stay near the main loop   anyone have any good suggestions were staying in hotels budget is max 70usd/person per day less would be preferred ofc but right location i think is most important    is staying in grids akihabara centrally located enough    if anyone has a hostel they think would be better let me know    we dont have a very solid trip itinerary were probably just going to be wandering around a lot id take any out of the ordinary recommendations on spots to visit as well only things we have planned as of yet are a cat cafe and red light district
  shinjuku is the better hotel central tokyo isnt really the best place to stay in generally all the interesting stuff including nightlife is in the west  only hiccup that id see is that its further from trains than the other two personally id get something in shibuya but up to you
    im staying at emblem hostel nishiari its about a twenty minute train ride to the center of tokyo so 30ish for the outskirts its really nice and quiet plus where its located is very peaceful as well
  no you need to be 20 mogra is a rip anyway go to an event at circus      they wont talk to some dumbass tourist you will get some posers but thats it no reason to talk to a foreigner other than trouble      depends great living is 100/day good living 75 moderate living 5055 assuming you stay in a hostel use metro passes each on the cheap if doing the latter      grids is fine in akihabara just understand you are closer to a jr hub than a metro hub you can still get around easy i liked staying there though in off season its usually just business men/women missed the train    what do you plan to do for 6 days just tokyo if so grids is probably most centric to things shinjuku is best for staying out late though
  im hitting up tokyo for 6 days soon live in honolulu finally visiting glorious japland what bars or clubs would you recommend in tokyo/shinjuku     im mostly gonna do tokyo and my friend recommended the suica card is that better than a rail pass what if i want to go slightly outside of tokyo for a hike etc
  bars  just walk around find some neat ones avoid robot bar  sucia  if staying in tokyo only do the metro pass when you get there 1500 yen for 72 hours of use metros have more stops and go to the same hubs as jr lines a jr pass would be worthless in tokyo only but useful if you wanted to use the shinkensan out of tokyo to like nagano/kyoto/sendai etc   outside tokyo  kamakura/enoshima is worth it kofu is nice too
i want to go on a hike in hiroshima  moderate level would be preferred to be completed in a day looking for some great views  any suggestions
  ogonzan is pretty much the only good place with a view mitakidera is a good one too
are japanese women huge sluts when compared to western ones i get a decent amount of pussy at home and want to try something more exotic if you catch my drift
  not really if you suck at pulling in women at home youll be likely to strike out in japan you have a language barrier which cuts a lot out and the meme about asian women being into weird fetish shit is just a meme the meme about oh big american pee pee so big white man please fuck me is also long and dead tokyo and other places get millions of visitors per year you arent all that special in a mega city    mostly the only thing you have up your sleeve is that when in japan being a tourist is a plus since they never have to see you again no possibility of you entering their real life and they can talk up the time to any friend and cant be proven wrong true there are a bunch of gaijin hunters but the most youll get in tokyo are probably going to be upper 20s to mid 30s     there are still plenty of opportunities for paid experiences in soapland shinjuku and such though if youre paying for an escort why the ever loving fuck you would do it in japan i would have serious questions about
  there are still plenty of opportunities for paid experiences in soapland shinjuku and such though if youre paying for an escort why the ever loving fuck you would do it in japan i would have serious questions about    the soapland experience is pretty nice desu she bathes you nuru massage mat play then an hour or so of gfe sex i had a great time and thought it was 32k well spent
  32k yen  pretty decent price though i know plenty of dumbasses who have paid double that for dumbshit that wasnt even good    friends first time in japan  2nd day in  tell him whatever he does dont go to shinjuku alone and never listen to the blacks about good deals my friend  anon stop being racist im 25 i can handle myself  famouslastwords  get call/text middle of the night like 3am  anon i fucked up and need help i just spent 75k yen on a hooker in a club some coke and a blowjob i blew a entire week of funds in 4 hours
hey guys living in tokyo atm    any good place to find bf game deals or second hand games
  black friday  outside the us    uhh probably not going to see much akihabara is your first best bet the ikebukuro and finally nakano just shop around
  not surprised people dont think when theyre out to party for my part i went to yoshiwara and went into 34 different soaps checking prices and available girls before the one that gave me 90 minutes for 32k a couple did start at 70k for 75 minutes and only started dropping prices/adding time when i said they didnt have any girls i liked and i was going to leave
    aeon malls have been advertising the fuck out of black friday thats the only place ive seen anything mentioning black friday sales
  yeah there are places that will have that going on but for what that anon is looking for probably not much in the way of things
  tokyo only maybe one day trip to fuji/suicide forest i know its memed to death on the internet but my friends still want to go badly     if you have any direct suggestions id love to hear them too
  if 6 days id suggest doing something like this    this is 150 dollars and also includes the narita express pass which will is like 40 bucks alone also gives you 5 days free rides on shinkensen and jr lines which if you do a day trip to say nagano90 or so minutes one way youll get your moneys worth out of it    1 check out tokyo my advice places like shinjuku only for night stuff in all honesty thats when it really seems to shine aside from the garden keep in mind lots of places close down around 7 or 8pm  2 group up areas to go say start the day at tokyo tower work up through aki taito and then do ueno area before heading out to something at night   3 mt fufi is unclimbable most the year so keep that in mind 5 lakes is good but you can still see fuji from many areas like kofu  4 matsumoto has some of the original castles see op and is a great day trip  5 nagano is in the japanese alps and has great nature and a good temple leading into a cool shopping district  6 in summer/warm seasons kamakura and enoshima island are good to visit each with their own cool things to do  7 plan plan plan make a checklist per day of things to do especially in a group youd be surprised how much time you can just waste trying to figure out what to do when in japan over plan things to do per day because chances are youll knock them out faster than you think first time going i planned a full morning around sensoji temple area blew through it in just over an hour while still seeing everything i wanted
  1210 to 125  will it rain/snow in tokyo what type of clothing should i wear im from california so im not used to cold weather
  tokyo usually is kept fairly warm due to the bay and doesnt generally get snow that often outside some minor dusting head into the mountains and such better chance of seeing anything worth while in terms of snow     will be chilly though talking 45 to freezing at nights hope you arent staying in tokyo a whole month for a vacation
  im just there to eat and look at/buy weebshit dont really give a shit about anything else what would a normal temperature be like during the day
  mid to upper 40s in the day mid to low 30s at night    a month in tokyo is going to be boring why not branch out hit up osaka or something got a good weeb scene there some of the mountains are fun to see in the winter as well
  ill be going to osaka/kyoto for about 2 weeks but im mainly in japan for the food is the weather significantly different there
  use accuweather generally tokyo is fairly dry kyoto and osaka can be rainy or what not     again use stuff like this     it can give you a pretty decent guess and show you what last years was
anyone planning on hitting up oarai in december ill probably be there on the 23rd planning on doing the onsen aquarium and a metric fuckton of walking
  take photos in aquarium and show us later please
how are the soaplands
  im going on the 2nd of january probably  unless most of the shops are closed on the 2nd which i have no way of knowing
  different anon but you sold me on the jr east pass can you do both kofu and matsumoto together as a day trip is kamakura worth seeing in the winter   im going next week and think i might wanna try a ryokan/ hot springs for an evening where would you recommend for that
where do you leave your luggage if you arrive in city before hotel checkin time  do you use lockers on train stations or can you leave your baggage in a hotel even before checkin time is that common practice in japan or should i send email to hotel and ask beforehand
  leave the baggage at the hotel it is a common practice everywhere  if you booked online just check that the hotel has luggage storage or a similarly named service listed
  id imagine oarai will be pretty dead on the 2nd hell i was out there last november and everything was pretty quiet shops and shit were open but there wasnt a lot of people it makes sense though oarai is a seaside town going during the winter is definitely out of season i was there this past may and it was a lot livelier
    yet another anon wondering why kamakura was worth it even in summer i wasnt really impressed by it but im not so much into temples
  yes kofu and matsumoto are on the chou limited express line covered within the pass your best bet would be to to use that for time sake hit all the way to nagano and bullet train back      wondering why kamakura was worth it even in summer  the beach is really fun/was fun for me seeing the sunset was cool live music drinks and a nice breeze off the water also some of the weekend events that go on are pretty cool it can be more of a day trip before heading to enoshima island its a nice stop over that has some things less crowded biggest buddha in japan and some near rail history      like the other anon said go to the desk say you got in early and would like to drop off your luggage prior to check in time protip make sure you have your reservation info out generally they will want to verify it most hotels will even put it in your room for you    train station lockers are okay if you are traveling to ab yet wanna stop over somewhere for lunch and not wanting to drag your bags along
  varies site to site day to day generally most will have a list of featured guests or whatever they call it that night/location     if there is some black dude out in front of it trying to haggle you to come in just get the fuck out youre about to be ripped off 9/10 times    haha bro very cool you come to japan hey i tell you what i have these hot asian women just turned 20 this week bro i tell you what youre smart i usually tell people 60k yen but ill cut you a deal to 50k yen and give you a free drink ticket for you and the lady yes great deal and better yet ill tell them in japanese you want the best girl they have    then you get in realize you get a whatever is on the low end scalped for about 2025k yen drinking isnt allowed and do whatever
  would any shops be closed since its the day after new years or will it be back to normal by then
    thanks i checked hotels on booking and they all have baggage storage    on unrelated note is there any list on what food you should try in japan maybe listed by priority   which one is a must try and which one is only try if you have eaten everything else already  disclaimer i have never been to any japanese restaurant and have no idea what that food is like
  use naviguru to look around it will give you some really good tourist friendly resturaunts word of advice be cautious of the kobe beef waygu 100 really shit often it is not the a5 grade shit you hear reviews about but that doesnt mean it isnt from a kobe farm or anything just a low grade cut sold en mass     best advice i can give you is understand portion sizes are smaller generally tend to be more oily carbohydrate full and tend to have more salt also a lot lack normal vitamins you are use to getting youll want to grab something like pic related from 711 once dailyespecially if lots of walking average meals will be around 6001000 yen try to eat away from train stations and a block or two over from a main street     i kinda like experiencing how japanese do other countries foods you get some really interesting and tasty things depends where you go but i suggest you try up near taitosensoji temple area for some random food shops or around shibuya
  oh ueno park usually has some cool street vendor food shops for things to try for usually well under 1000 yen
  this faggot weeb is lying again a girl every two months in japan no gitls art home
   a girl every two months in japan  aanon i thats not something to brag about lol    also i didnt say there is 0 hope i said you are likely to strike out which is completely true an introvert at home will often carry that trait with them even when traveling
  my cc company doesnt set a pin number so every once in awhile in japan you may be asked to provide a pin so either set one up on your card or carry some cash as a back up rarely had my card declined
  lack normal vitamins  why is that dont japanese need those vitamins or do they also use those suppliments every day  dont they have fruits in japan or are they expensive if that so i am bringing full case of apples with me will sell them for good money    i was thinking more like specific food for now i have on the list okonomiyaki buta don gyoza omurice udon soba noodles tonkatsu
  when you visit you will see why vitamin drinks and protien shakes are shilled everywhere at all times think about the place you are asking about japan is an island nation it has to import a lot of shit as well as deal with more typhoons and sub tropical storms than the us they are more focused on grains and meats than other things believe me was helping a group around once all were fucking dead tired showed them some vitamins and they got them each of the rest of the day and were perky as could be    if that so i am bringing full case of apples with me   customs will tell you to ditch them asap you cant bring seeds or plants on international flights last time i was in osaka 3 ears of corn was like 7 dollars or some shit i can dig the picture up   i was thinking more like specific food for now i have on the list okonomiyaki buta don gyoza omurice udon soba noodles tonkatsu    pretty much easy to find anywhere would ad shabu shabu on that though
is there somewhere where i can look up the upcoming japanese theatrical releases for february got a trip scheduled for then and id like to catch a local unsubtitled movie but imdbs upcoming release calendar even when set to japan only really shows upcoming japanese dates for hollywood movies and they dont seem to know about most domestic japanese films until theyre already out
  i think the 2nd heavens feel movie is airing then but im not 100 sure
  why the fuck would you want to see a japanese film lol serious question most the time the movies are barely b level quality watch some in flight to japan then question why the fuck you would see an actual japanese movie protip many movies playing in japan will be hollywood movies
  because thats what i did the last time i was there and it turned out enjoyable enough
  the code geass movie comes out in japan in february
  yeah and its non canon r3 dont give it money
i just want to know the best way to do japan on a budget help me bros
  airbnb  eat at 7/11  do free activities  congratulations you did it
  seeds or plants  so bananas then they are seedless jk  thanks for the info  another thing obviously i cant use chopsticks can i learn it fast enough or do they have forks for foreigners or should i just bring my own fork
what is considered good and bad chick wise for a white guy here what kinda numbers does anyone go out drinking alone and hunting jn tokyo     the biggest obstacle i am having issues most girls at run groups of two so one weird whitr guy trying to talk to both orn isolate one is impossible
im such in osaka without a jrpass for the next 3 days what is there to do except denden and amerikamura
im staying south of kinshicho station    theres a lot shady looking characters men and women standing around the streets at night when the shops start closing    im kinda scared
   can i learn it fast enough  yes look it up online and ty with a couple of long pencils if you cant get the proper chopsticks thats how i did it the only problem was the angle between the 3rd and 4th fingers a waiter in some pub in osaka pointed it out and after that everything was fine btw they had nice beer    shinsekai
  shopping in dotonburi or umeda  museum of housing and living is good for a half day trip  usj  expo city park also mostly shopping unless you also like photography
im planning the tokyo portion of my trip am i missing anything obvious is the area around tokyo tower worth it    day 1 odaiba shinjuku gyoen garden tokyo metropolitan building  day 2 ghibli museum pokemon center asakusa akihabara  day 3 harajuku meiji yoyogi
  do shinjuku on day 3 instead theres no reason to ride across all of central tokyo for 2 locations i recommend walking down from shinjuku to shibuya or other way around on day 3 youll visit all of the places you listed along the way replace day 1 shinjuku with either ginza or tokyo station/imperial palace  in my opinion minato in general is neglegible unless you need bars
  right i just looked at the map again and i probably fucked something up thanks anon
what to do in kyoto at night  how to meet prefalable girls   i have one night more in kyoto and two more in osaka
quickly    need to work remote 1 month and i need a confy town/location to sit down and write a lot    was thinking about kamakura but please give me something more hidden
  fuckton of walking  try and get a bike if you can relatively flat place and cycling was good fun around there  i went last year early december and will be going again 1416th this december
  try and get a bike    im not a fag sorry
  the fact its also a wednesday i feel like there certainly could be some things closed im same guy as  i went mid week last year december and it was pretty slow a fair few things were closed      kek i get ya   it really is better though especially if you want to go to the aquarium it means you dont have to take a bus if there is one and walking there would take a while as its actually quite far
  ferris wheels aquarium umeda sky building osaka castle universal studios
 op  im doing a day trip to nikko and another day trip to fujikawahakone from tokyo in april should i use a jr pass not especially for them ill be going to kanazawa and hiroshima after or get the nikko all area pass and the fuji hakone pass    i feel unlimited bus rides can be helpful especially to go to the lake and the waterfall in nikko not sure if ill use the discounts offered in the fuji hakone pass but unlimited bus rides again sound helpful
  i know ive walked to the aquarium before it took a fair bit but i enjoyed it i dont get enough fresh air on a normal basis lol
  also curious about this i was in the same position a couple years ago and chose gifu and while it was very hidden i saw one white person the whole time it was just like being in an average japanese city staying somewhere like kyoto would have been more normie but also more fun and weirdly cheaper there were like two airbnbs in gifu    im curious if there is a place that is   small   nice nature   cheap   easy to access
  small  nice nature  cheap  easy to access    youd be looking for oarai mai friendo ive been there several times and on only one occasion did i spot another foreigner im not sure what the airbnb situation is like ive only daytripped out there
japan is depressing me beyond beliving i was me lifelong dream since i was a kid i spend my 2 fucking month salaries  2500usd for 2weeks to realize that my imaged japan lifelong dream was better also even tired learning japanease but no one understand any of my shitty pronunciation people are polite and   culular the bone but there are all bunch of mean passive agressive people when i try to be friends with them i am traveling solo usally i can just strike a conversation or maybe meet somene  to be honest i just stay at night at hotels and watch movies with strong 0s i have only 1 ib kyoto and 2 nights in osaka  i even went to blockchain confernce in tokyo and it was all tatemae
  what are some good youtube channels to look into about japan both in the tourist and nontourist sense
what would you recommend to do on new years eve in tokyo
  check out a shrine  theres also fireworks in yokohama
i have 11 days in june next year is it worth going to kyoto/osaka was planning on just going to tokyo and doing some day trips because i kind of like travelling slow
  is this pasta
  go to countdown music live
  in all fairness your english is pretty shit too you may want to go ahead and kys just get it over with
      highly recommend what this anon says the lack of any other food/vitamins besides the over abundance of meat will fuck your literal shit up    i had a friend go to japan for 2 weeks last year in october and the diet change fucked him up so hard that he had to go vegetarian only when he came back he developed protein crystals in his joints or whatever that illness is called he only just recently was able to go back to a normal diet    im here in my last week and have always been getting some fruit juice everyday and have been fine so far i was not aware of the posted vitamin drink so thanks for that
  no but my dream vacation that werent so good atleast i can die with peace that i went to japan only good things were seeing fuji at hakone at sunset onsen tokyo at night and great buddist gardens in kamakura the rest including food is overpriced boring shit
  i have the same question going in june/july for the first time
  im planning day trips to nikko and fujikawahakone should i swap one of those for kamakuraenoshima
    2 weeks  expects to make friends as a foreigner  passive aggressive people when i try to be friends with them  traveling solo    how the fuck have you been approaching the locals    instead of trying to become friends with strangers in a country youre only going to be in for 14 days aim to become that short moment in their lives where they met some foreigner    you sound like you want to impress complete strangers in a society where people are overworked barely have time for themselves the wages of those you met probably suck and their population is on the verge of getting cut in half and not to mention you have to get over the language barrier    become that brief moment where they met some foreign guy rather than wanting to be another number on their social media followers list    or get drunk with a salaryman in an izakya
so because of planning probably need to stay at an internet cafe for a few days 2 or 3 i am considering staying for a week tokyo akihabara shinjuku  any advice in wich are the best to stay   any cafes where 2 people maybe a 4 can stay
  is your budget so thin that you have stay at a net cafe the money saved may not be worth the hassle especially for 24 people
  budget is not big but we want to experience it  and looking into other sleeping places are sold out at the moment
  right a cute
im going to be in tokyo from dec 27th to jan 4th should i be worried about a lot of stuff being closed over new years i dont want to end up stuck in my hotel or having no eating options aside from convenience stores
what are some good places for new years shrine visits for 1st to 3rd january bonus points if they are interesting or animerelated  this year ive been to kanda washinomiya and yasukuni
  visiting tokyo next september  from ireland so im a sweaty fucker when it goes above 20c  want to walk around the city without being an out of breath pile of sweat    how fucked am i whats the weather normally like for september in tokyo    also i know japanese dress kind of conservatively will i stand out completely by wearing shorts and showing off my very hairy legs seriously my legs are so hairy i feel like its a thing that people would be pissed about but are too polite to tell me
  15 hours is nothing theyll dim the lights and most people nap throughout the course of the flight youll have seat back movies to watch and occupy your time when you are awake the seats do get uncomfortable after a while but try to get an aisle seat and just get up to take a piss/ stretch your legs every couple of hours and youll be fine    also if you you sit near the windows dont be cunt and open your when the cabin lights are dimmed
  not really fucked unless you dont plan properly ive been to japan in september with people from the uk/norway/ireland best advice i can give you is this  go to a sports store get the breathable shirts and pants  drink plenty of water whenever you can not soda coffee or sweet tea water  get some vitamins daily like posted in  when you sweat you lose more than just water  use metro pass or what not more than not just walking it will land you in the hospital if not use to it  dont wear dark clothing wear light clothing    also most people and places do not have ac units they have swamp coolers which dont cool as quickly and generally keep things humid when you have the ability to go sit inside take it if you arent use to that kind of environment had one of my friends end up in the hospital because he didnt think it would be that bad he was from sweden and quickly found out the hard way
  cheapotokyo japan is fairly cheap so long as you plan correctly seriously 20 dollars a day can take you far      does anyone go out drinking alone and hunting jn tokyo  i dont know what area you are in so hard to tell taito has a different scene than ginza and shinjuku is dair different than shibuya need to be more specific  the biggest obstacle i am having issues most girls at run groups of two  the buddy system is a big thing in japan so pretty common for something like this to happen      have you never been otside before      its not a meme people say to stay in osaka and do kyoto for day trips kyoto shuts down early and has virtually nothing after closing time aside from specific bars for tourists the east river generally has some clubs but they are a snooze fest      the jr east pass is like 150 bucks and takes you there getting a jr pass just for bus passes is dumb since the buses are so damn cheap
  also even tired learning japanease but no one understand any of my shitty pronunciation  this is why i generally tell people not to speak japanese unless you are for sure know what you are saying or state about how you think its this and just flat out admit your japanese blows otherwise it just comes out weird and cant actually figure out what you are intending to tell me or any other japanese person stick to some core phrases and bone up on it if you know japanese awesome just understand there are drawbacks on how you make things sound       for the rest of your story sorry you had a bad time but i am not sure what else to tell you japan can be the best and worst place to visit since everyone seems to have this weird headcannon about it being all smiles and rainbows with happy japanese school girls prancing around      i am traveling solo usally i can just strike a conversation or maybe meet somene  what most people never understand about japan or japanese is that time is virtually everything to most people who live there most people dont have the same luxury as the western world does of sitting down and shooting the shit the best time youll have that opportunity is during a holiday time late hours at a bar or in the summer around the beaches other than that youll have a decently hard time just finding someone to sit and chill with     in all reality if you want more of a laid back experience with japan youre better off going to hokkaido or something where there is a pretty different mindset to a lot of things the tokyonagoyaosaka belt has people who are focused on go go go
  takayama
  for the most part no chain stores and resturaunts will be open youll always be able to find something in shinjuku regardless the day    the small mom and pop shops will be closed but generally tokyo will be open if you were in somewhere like sendai or sapporo you may have a harder time but tokyo is ez mode
  jr east pass is like 150 bucks  why the fuck would i buy a jr east pass to go to nikko for a day   also i said should i get the all access pass for the buses not jr pass all access pass to nikko is 4000 yenfuji area pass is 8000yen     jr east is 20000 yen
  well because it lets you use the nex so there is 4500 yen off the top if you are flying into nrt you can use the shinkensan unlimited times which will get you there faster and do various day trips around also the jr pass allows you to use jr line buses     if youre already dropping 12k yen to get to fuji and nikko why not just pay that extra 3000 yen for all that much more in flexibilityspeedier travel    its just an option worth exploring youre free to do whatever but there is a lot of benefit to a jr pass especially if your japanese isnt on par the ability to just flash the pass at the gate and go is pretty nice
  kamakura was absolutly the most beautifull espasially that temple near the sea also 5 temples took one day alone even with bikecycle also mind mountains when choosing  hakone is awesome too onsen and lake ln particular      well that may be the case mostly i talked for 515 minutes and after thay i was just politly ignored usalually i would ask to get something to eat drink join the table i dont know even in izakayas with are i think overrated i tried get drunk with salary men but there are in groups and dont speak english     other than that youll have a decently hard time just finding someone to sit and chill with   this that seams to be the case everywhere there is a rush and people glued to smartphones  and yeah i think my japanease sucks i tried only learning speaking with pimsleur course 80h and it was pointless    japan can be the best and worst place to visit since everyone seems to have this weird headcannon about it being all smiles and rainbows with happy japanese school girls prancing around     yeah it was ok but only that but you know it was my dream from childhood to experiance japan and it didnt live to hype of trv and other people not to mention my dream and also i was anxious about money becouse i am poor but yeah in the end and i happy that i went so i can cross out japan from my life dreams  one day more kyoto and in osaka
  word of advice i give people who are looking for a place to chat with some people is any british pub generally foreign workers and stuff get taken out to them often since there is a mentality that its closer to home for them i dont get it but eh you can generally find good english speakers there pub hub is the biggest chain to do that in hooters in shibuya is anotheryes there is a hooters there
  so i can use the jr pass for the same benefits as i said ill be going to kanazawa and hiroshima so ill be buying a jr pass anyway
  a japan area pass is the exact same as a jr pass the only difference is that it is only for select areas if youre going to hiroshima you are just going to need to get the national pass as the east pass does not cover those routes pic related     the reason area passes can be useful is because over the course of 2 weeks you can use then on random days where as the jr national pass is 7 days concurrent then again there are a fair amount of people who buy an area pass and fudge it for other areas not recommended though
my plane ticket is bought and all my lodgings are booked anything else i should make sure to reserve in advance
  only thing i would say is that is a lot of time in osaka though guess you are doing mostly day trips around to other places     keep in mind that miyajima to tokyo is a damn long train ride unless you are flying thats going to be 56 hours on a train so dont expect to be in tokyo by noonif you are going to attempt a first train ride out you may want to look into reserving a seat as that is one of the times they fill up if you are down for some drinks in tokyo for nye keep an eye on the thread ill buy ya a beer if we meet up
what all creepy areas are there in japland    i know about inari shrine and the sea of trees
  battleship island  yashimasome areas    define creepy lots of places around mt fuji have a ton of lore around it in terms of spooks
  okinawa
hows the weather like around march and early april google searches tell me its around 1315 degrees celsius but for some reason im finding that hard to believe
  depends where you go use accuweather for specific areas
  i dont know on march bit right now im in nara with a tee and it is the end of november i would be at 2 degrees back home
    ah shouldve specified im talking more so about kyto area il check on accuweather thanks lads
  comic city is on while im there  oh sweet  its in fukuoka  oh fuck    got nothing against the city its just on the other side of the country from sapporo speaking of which im surprised that site doesnt mention anything about the big snow miku event there    any other sites with interesting weaboo event listings fujoshit idolshit cosplay car meets artist exhibitions i hear some doujinshi artists show their work off in galleries id like to see what all the options are
  in case you misspelt kyoto it is like 40 km from nara weather sholu be also good    just in case im going to shill weatherunderground its the only site ive know that you can check weather reports of passed days
    thanks guys    like just spooky in urban legends and stuff like that  shrine visit at the hour of the ox and similar stuff like inari shrine
  i had a two week pass when i went 100 the easiest way to get around by train you just flash it and they wave you through
shinjuku best place to stay if im planning day trips out of tokyo
  if your day trips involve leaving town via shinjuku station i guess although if thats the case many places in the tokyo area can also get to/from shinjuku station relatively quickly
should i go to osaka aquarium is osaka a shithole  i went throught the city and kinda hated it there are trash city smells and it looks ugly compared to tokyo or evrn yokohama i dont know what do to here  also on dotonbori i was aproched twice asked if i want japanease girls once i asked for a price and was quoted 16000yen with possibilty of a disscount  are there really 16000yen prostitiutes
im in japan at the moment are there any soaplands that cater to westerners also where to go to see idol shows preferably without having to win some lottery or buying tickets in advance
  shinjuku airbnb seems understandably more expensive what are other decent areas do i try to look at or is any place near a station good
  meet    also 140 seems high for a chinese human trafficked woman
  i should clarify that i am in tokyo area i think im in or near a red light district in koiwa i almost got pulled into a hostess club on my way back to a hotel tonight but the links in the op dont list any here and the links provided are difficult to make sense of    anyone have any insight/suggestions
  sorry for slow reply like that matters on 4chan but still  i was doing the shimanami kaido the last couple days and didnt have my laptop    yeah fair call it is quite a nice path out there along the beach so would be a nice walk for sure  hope you have fun in oarai its such a great place   also just be careful with opening days of the aquarium when i went last december it was closed and then i saw on the website that random closed days in december are common for doing work and such        yeah oarai fits the bill pretty well  and there is 1 good airbnb there at least though 6070ish australian 4550us per night may not be cheap to you idk  might get a decent price on hotel i have only looked during very very busy times where 50000 people visit for a festival
  osaka aquarium is pretty big its kinda fun imo though if youve been to hundreds of aquariums before i dont really see a point on visiting it
    guess you are doing mostly day trips around to other places  yes ill be visiting kyoto from osaka  into reserving a seat as that is one of the times they fill up  alright thanks for the advice  if you are down for some drinks in tokyo for nye keep an eye on the thread  thanks ill keep an eye out
  pretty much anyplace near a station is good just plug in where youre thinking of staying and the station youll be taking your day trips from in google maps and check the travel time between them
  ramen for starters is a totally different game find a place that has a line up but i had to do my research through eavesdropping and reading western accounts of eating in these places usually cramped hole in the wall style and obscure unless they develop a following    if your that foreigner that goes in and is super picky and ends up not even eating the noodles and leaving behind more than half the bowl dont bother these places are also not socially engaging they are solitary endeavors go in order eat and go
  yea youre a fatso
  i mean i go to british style pubs pretty often so i can see the appeal
  tru they are more prim in regards to clothing you wont see a native dressed like a tourist heathen in their t shirts and oversized baby cargo shorts but they wont bother with you since that is like a good uniform for a foreigner a passive aggressive comment about your carpet legs might be whispered between a pair of school girls/salrymen/dowers but it wont reach your ears
hi everyone got back from japan about a weekandahalf ago starting to really miss it honestly was based in tokyo and was planning to take a few overnight trips out to kyoto and gifu but boy does tokyo have a way of sucking time out of you every turn i just found new stuff i wanted to see or do i dont regret it though    ill probably try to make it out to japan again sometime in the next few years but ill probably do a trip up and down the country on rail rather than sticking mostly to tokyo     a few pics incoming shinjuku gyoen was beautiful
  club sega 4 was the best one in my opinion akiba is just as awesome as i hoped it would be
  ichiran is the kind of restaurant that polarizes people even so i will continue to love it and coco
  odaiba was surprisingly quiet made the visit to the sea life park quite relaxing though
  as much as people look down on touristy things i actually find them rather fun makes meeting people pretty easier since you have something to talk about
  enoshima is my favorite place hands down i would die happily there
  have a ton more but thisll be the last one merry christmas all hope you enjoyed the pictures
how do taxes work in japan  specifically a refund of consumption tax for visitors    has anybody leveraged this  do stores begrudgingly participate  do locals abuse this by shopping with a foreigner    is there a /trv/ approved faq
anyone here do any solo trips to japan     how was your experience i heard staying at hostels is a good place to meetup with other travelers
will most places be able to tell/care if a gaijin isnt legal drinking age
  hey i stayed at nishiarai for a while
    two solo motorcycle trips i got lonely in matsumoto day 4 of 7 i believe most human interaction i felt i had was catching some 1012 year old girl walking hand in hand with her parents laughing at me scoff down octopus balls on a bench in kusatsu ended up in a hostel near kawaguchiko on day 6 was a welcome relief though stereotypically goofy folk would recommend theyd all just hike fujisan was jealous    its hard i do like travelling alone sometimes especially the first time id kill myself if i didnt have anyone to share with though
moving to the chubu district in february for an english instructor job anybody have any horror stories about living in nagoya and its surrounding areas
  glad you had fun mate  i too loved shinjuku gyoen when i went there    i liked the layout of ichiran with your own little booth where you could remove the wall if you were with someone you had a little water tap overall it was just a cool layout i thought food was delicious too   but yeah i get why people may not like it when you can get a good bwl of ramen a lot cheaper at a small restaurant  im in japan right now but still enjoyed seeing your pictures
  i got the tax refunded on a few figures i bought in nakano broadway last year by taking it to the service counter they literally just look at your passport then give you cash back of however much tax it was with a tiny bit of paperwork  is that what you wanted to know  i assume any store that advertises itself as tax free wont mind doing it and a lot of others have signs saying they arent tax free i assume because they dont want to deal with it so id say take advantage of it if its offered and you would actually get back a good amount of money
what kind of storage will i get at a sakura hostel any high rated one i guess a place to lock up suitcase and would fit by day bag dont want to get my figs stolen desu
  god damn it everyone is saying enoshima is amazing might have to drop nikko for it desu
  it seems a bit more googling has brought this up    i was planning on doing a bit of extra shopping at a japanese costco if i had the chance and i was hoping to save a bit more
is there something worth seeing between odawara and nara    it feels odd to visit things around tokyo osaka and hiroshima and leave that area unseen
  thanks anon
  ah right consumables versus general items sorry i didnt do any tax refunds on consumables   hopefully you can figure it out if you are spending a bit 8 can be a decent amount of money back
anon looking for brothels update found one or rather a bunch kept being hussled into waiting rooms i wasnt planning on buying when i saw prices online but one place gave me nongaijintax service and was reasonably budgeted so i caved
  no worries  doesnt seem to be a lot of practical information    also it doesnt look like there are many people to take advantage of this or they havent read the section of this thread
    where bros
trying to plan a tokyo trip fall/winter last year i live in the great frozen north of the us so im not worried about the cold but at what point do you guys think the chaos from the olympics will have died down should i plan a different trip that year and come back to my tokyo plans in 2021
  last year  meant to say next year
  just do it
  ill only give hints because i dont want this secret gem to be destroyed by dumbass pajeets its an area in the areas of tokyo near a temple that has been erased from maps    some places seem to run by pretty aggressive staff one in particular had a sign that said to kill a couple of pajeets on sight so fuck you pajeet fucks fuck off back to your shithole country youre fucking up my home country and now youre fucking up japan too especially this hidden area thats only just seeming to become open to gaijin
  osaka aquarium is one of the biggest aquarium in the world so i think its worth a visit personally i enjoyed it    and osaka is known to be dirtier than tokyo it definitely doesnt help with the increase number of tourists at the street food areas and the small number of garbage cans in the area    and yes there are 16000yen prostitutes but most likely the session will be rather short probably around like 15 to 20mins
  definitely ask for time limits on that price i spent 300k for one hour with major haggling and shopping around tokyo guy from above
  oops meant 30k
  lets meet up for a bout of sweaty craic lad
  dont if you must then break up with the chick youre seeing first
  i went to japan for ten days two years ago i went to clubs couple of times whenever i chatted with a girl she would be really interested but would always ask me to buy her a drink i red a bunch of gay threads like this about japanese girls being gold diggers and what not so i always declined and moved along on my second to last day i thought what the fuck and bought that fucking drink and 30 minutes later i was fucking this chick in the club toilet model grade bitch did the same thing next day and fucked another girl at love hotel getting laid in japan is easiest shit in the world when youre 180cm glowinthenight pale and blue eyed blond dude highly recommend
  tfw glowinthenight pale and brown eyed dark haired dude  brb getting my pubes dyed
  i had pretty lofty expectations for japan since a kid  it honestly blew me out of the water better than i ever imagined only problem now is my life feels very hollow and empty
  youre meant to do something i just stayed on board every time whoops
  i think theres cases where a train operated by one company rides on tracks owned by another thats when the line name changes but google says to stay on the same vehicle and then you dont have to do anything but there are also cases where one station serves several companies and then you either go through special transfer tickets on some shortcut gates that get you from a to b for a discount rate compared to riding on two separate tickets and exiting and reentering the platform area at midpoint or you just follow the crowd and use an ic card on any gates to let the system solve the problem for you
      case in point for tokyo metro
  this image is from the same train as long as you jumped on the correct train this would have taken you there a traim change would have listed a walking movement and a different logo if it changed company
  any lawsons just hit yes on the screen most bigger clubs will usually check id at the door smaller places wont there isnt really a drinking age in japan that is enforced      has anybody leveraged this  you show your passport you get a very small discount depending on the place  do locals abuse this by shopping with a foreigner  no if anything they only would want you to buy a jr pass for them anything else is far too small to care no one is going to give a shit you bought them a 10 cheaper doujinshi      solo constantly about 3 times a year if not doing some kind of work related thing solo travel is really amazing but you need to plan to keep yourself moving if youre an introvert and itinerary is basically required      nothing outside it actively being really really boring met a few teachers from there before they just complain the amount of things is very limited      it depends usually just keep shit behind the counter and ask for it back at checkout generally you get a small locker for something backpack sized in most hostels
      sex is offered all over japan you dont need to find a secret place for it or anything just not be a dumbass seriously i have a hard time believe someone hasnt been offered sex unless they went around as ultra weeb mega otaku and spent all their time in akihabara and refused to stay out past 10pm being in a group can also have similar effects when attempting to find a brothel but they are by no means hidden all that much    dumbest mistakes you can make are  asking out right for paid sex  walking around on main streets/at train stations  thinking a maid from a cafe works on the side  thinking you can find a good spot before nightfall    go to kawasaki if all else fails the amount of love hotels and hookers around there are stupidly high in numbers
  if youre an introvert and itinerary is basically required    i dunno at least when in tokyo it seems i can basically decide where to go while im going there and never run out of things to explore then again i only get to go there about once a year so im not yet at the point of needing a schedule packed with events to get through the day
  being really really boring  cool ill fit right in
  alright thanks anon
  that was a great video desu absolutely based and redpilled
where to eat michelin star food in osaka for modest price  max around 5000yen  this is one think that i left and stupidly i didnt make any reservatios i am planning tomorrow to go to bumbuan for lunch but i doubt that they would have free table
  this i didnt find it to be common during my travels but i have ridden on a handful of trains that ive stayed on because they changed lines in the middle of their route
bump
how and where can i meet an old thick japanese business woman milf and not escort but literally actually hang out with one and maybe smash
  loving this negativity did you get scammed out of a lot of cash
  id assume all those typical apps like skout and tinder and maybe hello talk and other language exchange apps    or whatever bar or pub is frequented by such types you may be shit out of luck since you have the language barrier of course this is just an educated stab in the dark though    i wouldnt mind a milf
  been on 3 solo trips to japan nowor was it 4 im honestly losing count doesnt help that ive travelled with friends as well so events and experiences are starting to mix together    solo travelling in general is a very mixed experience there are moments where you do feel lonely during your travels especially in situations or moments where having friends around would make it more enjoyable you tend to run into some awkward or uncomfortable situations such as eating by yourself or having to do certain activities solo and sometimes being alone limits what you can do or how much enjoyment you can get out of something like going to an amusement park or eating at an izakaya    but theres definitely advantages with travelling by yourself as well setting your own schedule and itinerary and doing things at your own pace is a huge plus there are moments where i really appreciate the merits of travelling alone like taking my time at looking at things in a museum or being able to look through harajuku without having to stop at every other store    im not really an introvert but i also dont really feel the need to socialize and make new friends either when im on these trips not into the nightlife scene at all so i dont have to worry about mingling with such crowds and i strongly prefer to have my own room to sleep and keep my stuff in so i dont deal with hostels
anyone here know about the average housing price to rent or buy around okinawa
   does anyone here know about the average housing price to rent or buy around okinawa
  i can speak japanese not fluent or anything but decent  i also speak it like a soft shonen boy and i look like a trap
  not sure how you assumed that i was more pointing out that getting sex in japan or into a brothel is by no means hard or some sikret club a hooker someone at a bar or gijian hunters arent that hard in terms of things      virtually any bar in shibuya or in ginza
  fuck off army scum
i have been here in japan for 5 days and i still didnt got drunk  is there good nightlife on hiroshima i am specially interested in drinking in a izakaya with a japanesse bussinessman and boing to a karaoke with a japanese milf
  is there good nightlife on hiroshima  fuck no its a port town and most places are sick of the extremely high tourist count there    i am specially interested in drinking in a izakaya with a japanesse bussinessman and boing to a karaoke with a japanese milf    yeah good luck there champ
  damn now im just jealous     carry on dude live the dream
  first time i went in a group and had a fairly bad time so i tend to meetup with x over there from now on i found it 100 easier to meet people when traveling by myself no one thought they were intruding on my group or what not also found it easier to spur of the moment things go to random place i just found out about being with your friends though can make things easier and usually more fun but to an extent ive had issues where x drank far too much the night before so he dragged his feet the whole day making whatever we did a bit more of a chore or had y spend too much on something so he didnt feel like going to an event or what not     just depends how you work with your friends and how close you are believe me you really wont know what your friends are like till you travel fairly far from home and for 1 week some of the calmest people i thought i knew became absolute fucking clueless retards in japan and every night had to be a night out for more beers because it was vacation
  are you ok bud
  of course then
  could you settle for bib gourmand
  anyone here do any solo trips to japan   how was your experience i heard staying at hostels is a good place to meetup with other travelers    ive spent 3 months vacationing in japan over the last four years 70 solo usually a week with friends and two weeks without or something    japan is a unique place to solo travel specifically dead hostels where there are either very few people or the people are unsocial are more common if you can muster up the confidence the latter is usually a case of people being shy travelers to japan are shyer as an average imagine that and you can really look like a god if you just casually introduce yourself to people ive gotten laid twice in hostels in japan with attractive women and attribute that to the fact that i was the most confident one in a room full of lessconfident people    the latter case however is just a bummer you will be alone and drink a strongzero and eat konbini food and watch netflix and go to bed it is what it is but i recommend finding a nearby sento and getting a good hot/cold rotation bath to chill beforehand so you can wake up refreshed and do some serious walking/biking/general tourism the next day    tldr solo traveling in japan has all the benefits of solo travel but requires that you overcome your social anxiety a little more than other places also book hostels that have a bar or have high ratings on hostelworld
  where can i meet an old thick japanese business woman milf  i met and saw them all the time in certain shibuya clubs just hang around a bar or two and watch them swarm if youre young looking i guess i honestly thought of being a gigolo
  not him but i was checking out every michelin recognized place i can go to thats cheap and i wonder what is the difference between a bib gourmand or another highly rated stall everyone ive asked said the food is going to be wonderful wherever you go and eating at 1 star michelin places wont make much difference for a regular tourist

  do locals abuse this by shopping with a foreigner    my gf does every now and then if she wants to buy something pricey getting 8 off everything is pretty nice
is kamakuraenoshima advisable if im going to kanazawakyoto     i realized i might be templed out by the end
  tfw no thick ol milf abusing my foreigner status for tax free
    following up can someone make a list of the most beautiful and must visit shrines/temples i feel its insane to pay about 10 for every shrine ill visit probably end up spending 500 only on entry fees for the attractions
lets be honest guys how did oda anger (((them)))  he mustve refused some gaijin demands that they funded a revolt against him    nothing makes me angrier when i read about japanese history and think about how this great man was killed
shower shoes for hostels    good idea
  i feel its insane to pay about 10 for every shrine ill visit    who the fuck is charging you to visit a shrine virtually all are freeyoure getting scammed ive only known one place to charge an entrance fee and that was the giant buddha in kamakura which was like 300 or so yen you know what donation means right        yeah you can generally find some at lawson 100 stores or something i dont wear them but i run/walk a lot and have some decent calluses
  nigga most temples cost money to enter
  no they dont unless you are going into the museum part of them or some event is going on i have only paid for one temple to enter ever and that was due to seeing the historical section of it which for all realistic reasons is a museum palaces/castles will often charge but temples/shrines usually work off donations and other forms of income    if youre in kyoto then yeah okay i can see more charging for entry since most of their economy is tourism though i generally avoid kyoto
  i used the tax free shopping quite a bit in japan pretty much every time i spent more than 5k yen at a shop that had the tax free shopping sign most of the time i would ask about the tax free shopping in english or point to the sign since i dont speak japanese and then give them my passport theyd then print off another receipt and staple it into my passport i only used the tax free shopping for consumables once at the costco near makuhari they took everything i bought and wrapped it up in plastic with these big labels inside that said not for consumption inside japan  i ended up eating it all in japan anyways and at customs at narita when i was leaving the guy just tore out all the receipts from my passports without looking at them and then let me go
  kamakuraenoshima is doable in one day in the summer but in winter the sun going down may effect how much time you can spend in each    kamakura is a really peaceful town great temple and walk up through main town to it small old town to the side good buddha and awesome good day hikes    enoshima island is just temple shrine and cool shit all over the town is pretty nice cool for food nice view of mt fuji on a clear day
  most old large buddhist temples do in fact charge an entry fee usually its 200500 yen but ive seen 800 as well shrines though are nearly always free but some notably large ones will charge fees as well
does anyone know of how restaurants are usually like in japan
  what do you mean anon there are all kinds of places are we talking fast food sit downs group restaurants bars what
  group restaurants pretty much the photo which i have on there is one of the restaurants from a family trip to taiwan but i do wanna know how theyre set up like around japan
  group restaurants will generally have a minimum number of people required many of those ones youve seen with booths or izakayas sometimes will require 2 people to be seated the larger sized ones will generall have a bar for single people who just want to drink and eat an small dish of like say sushi some girlled small seafood thing or yakatori sticks anything that is a run off from a larger dish    there are a few reasons for this and all can vary usually it is because cook/wait staff is limited the only dishes that place makes are very large so they dont want to waste food or they are more high end and want to fill up in order to stay in business nomihodai often requires 2 people usually posted with 2人 after price and time somewhere its kinda weird to grasp but if they arent busy and you are obviously foreign many places will seat you even if its 2 person minimum though your price for the dish will not go down you just get 2 persons meal and most generally have set prices for what each course is
  gotcha i usually prefer my food to be grilled well enough not really a huge fan of raw fish or any other uncooked dishes though i might enjoy the yakatori sticks along with some sauce added on it thanks for the info btw
  use naviguru for a few things generally a good way to find what you are looking for and what kind of set courses they may offer or if any minimum number of people more often than not youll be able to walk into most places sit and order just be aware there are some special kinds     also when looking for places to eat on google or otherwise anything above a 3 star is fine in ratings japanese people seem to do 1 star for any various number of minor reasons such as asked for portions some broth spilled on table when eating not joking about how insane some of the ratings reasons can be
  i see sometimes i would go onto either trivago or yelp just to check the rates of each places it even depends on how customer services are usually handled as well
  basically all of the temples/shrines in kyoto charge and half the ones in nara
going in june when should i book my hotel apa probably also where in tokyo or an airbnb/hostel
so im hitting up tokyo for 2 weeks over christmas and new years ive got a list of things to do over there but also wanna chuck it open to you guys l i reckon this thread knows way more than other sites about cool little places so im all ears    i got my accommodation in asukasu and the train tickets sorted out too so im not too limited for travelling at least
  bro just fucking hit up tinder i did and ive already got a few dates with older women lined up over there
  please stop    in any case my point still stands ill probably go to the few best temples and shrines or else check out the free ones so does anyone have enough japan experience to make a temple list like this guy  
  basically all of the temples/shrines in kyoto     yeah thats why i said in a post kyoto is a different story if you go to say gifu nagano or other prefectures with old temples as well you generally get in free kyotos economy is based off tourism keeping those temples looking stupidly close to what the brochure said it looks like is important    then again i dont really see that many paid for shrines and temples that often unless you are going to an ultra touristy one even then if 300 yen for temples is breaking your budget i am unsure if you planned for japan properly
   ill probably go to the few best temples and shrines or else check out the free ones so does anyone have enough japan experience to make a temple list like this guy    no one knows where you are going so hard to tell plenty of free shrines since shrines are littered everywhere pic related you will see so many of these things this on is near akihabara station and there are 10s of thousands of these all over the placeget this all free what kind of shrine or temples do you want here     onsenji temple in gero  zenkoji temple in nagano right next to daihongan very historic feed since more a museum but you get anything you want at zenkoji which is better and has performances free  kifunejinja shrine in northern kyoto fee to get access directly in alt path available  enoshima island is just filled with temples and shrines all free escalator pass 600 yen iwaya caves are great kamakura should go with it    are a few temples are also largely free it just depends where you are going and how popular it may be     use that for anything else  most temples and shrines in japan are free to enter but the more famous historic temples will charge an admission fee for which you will receive entry and usually an explanatory leaflet in either japanese or english    good quick description of most again admission fee depends on the temple you are visiting and when some holiday seasons sometimes even the historic ones open up for free because the mass influx of donations they get eg new years
ill be in tokyo in mid december any suggestions for christmas markets
      good chunk of most of them found here
  based dotombori
  osaka fuckin rules dude its kinda like a chicago to tokyos nyc
pay the 1000 yen to go to kyoto osaka is a poor man shithole with nothing to do kyoto has so much more and original castles and old towns since it wasnt bombed in ww2
   so was it all that worth it then
  yes indeedfiktktktktkktktktktktktktkktktktkyktktktktktktktktktktktltltltlttlltltltlttltlltlttltltltltltlttltl
im in the sendai area and just feeling like a chill day tomorrow or the day after   anyone know of any good anime/weeb stores   i saw they have a lashinbang which has gotten me some good finds in nakano osaka and kyoto this trip so im hopeful on that but want to know if there are other good stores here
  also related for anyone thinking about going to the north/sendai area  i can heartily recommend spending a day at matsushima lots of nice little things there   fukurijima bridge/island are pretty cool oshima/ojima island is very cool with some very different to normal historical stuff carving in rock instead of temples/shrines entsuin garden is absolutely beautiful right now with autumn colour and the temples in that area are pretty good also lots more carvings in the rock walls around the temple area theres an area in town where a bunch of temples are all near each other
what country has the best women   its sure as hell not america
fact if you cant get quality woman in america you are ugly
  i like women whos thoughts and ideas i actually want to listen to and american women are the total opposite of that even bongs are more tolerable
  thats just a problem of not running in the right circles the problem is only exasperated when you go abroad because only a certain kind of person befriends foreigners and those people arent the people you are searching for
  imagine defending burger women
  i like women whos thoughts and ideas i actually want to listen to
  even if women were only for being seen and not heard you could do better than burger women
  its sure as hell not america  but american women are easy to fuck
  i met loads of intelligent women in the states you are too dumb to meet them thats probably the reason
ethiopia
  based and redpilled
japan if you have yellow fever  america if you dont
theres no such thing as good women
as an european dutch to be exact i found that american women were the best in the world they tend to be very nice have very good bodies and have far lower standards than almost all other women ive dated    downsides from american women is that they are a bit too traditional they expect to get married and fall in love with you very quickly they are also a bit too clingy    ive dated women of 3 different nationalities so i will compare them to those  dutch  belgian same shit  dutch women tend to be stoic and free spirited meaning they see sex as a form of entertainment and not as a part that only belongs in relationships im dutch as well so i kinda agree with this dutch women are very egalitarian and not materialistic this usually means that she wont expect you to pay anything for her and she wont mind paying for you on dates its also expected that you both have a career and she wont mind if you dont have a job and live off of her income focus of the relationship is more like a financial partnership and friendship that includes sex    physical characteristics is tall and skinny with dirty blonde hair and blue/green eyes usually highly educated    1/2
japanese  i lived in japan for a couple of years and had a longterm japanese girlfriend what is really weird about japanese women is that they never truly show their feelings they are overly materialistic and expect you to pay for everything like she is your pet or something the worst part was that there is a total disconnect between sex and romance in japan its expected for you and the girl to have sex outside of the relationship as its just physical while romance is something else i thought that was very creepy i broke up when she started to demand my entire salary should be deposited on her bank account and she would give me allowance to life off of from my own salary fuck that    physical characteristics is short and skinny with bad teeth not rotting or badly maintained but crooked vaginas are kinda too shallow education is usually not very high and the girls will act stupid on purpose due to the culture thinking dumb women are attractive and cute     israeli   should notice that this was a relatively modern girl that was just culturally jewish came to the netherlands to study at my university where i met her a lot of focus on family values she expected me to pay for stuff but she wasnt very materialistic a lot of focus on the future and she only seemed interested in the long term of the relationship and how life would go after graduation not very emotional but not stoic like dutch women still tried to be very feminine despite this    dont know about physical characteristics because she didnt look like an average jewish girl at all redhead with blue eyes extremely white skin with freckles and very large boobs she was very short though she was obviously intellectual and had academic goals in life most of her family were academics and during a summer stay in tel aviv with her parents i found out that this is very normal in israel israeli people value intellectualism a lot so i would guess this is a normal trait for jewish/israeli girls
  the problem with egalitarian culture is that then men have to compete based solely on looks i find this interesting in other countries you can see 4/10 men with 7/10 women not in the netherlands for example in my country a taller women with a shorter man is a common sight in the netherlands it is taboo so in a weird way they are egalitarian in terms of economics but then very traditional in terms of looks
  every time i learn something about japan it always strikes me as backwards and barbaric
  italy of course
  plenty of good american women the culture encourages independent thought discourages unquestioning loyalty to family  gene mixing from all the northern/eastern europeans  attractive euro physical features all mashed together at least in new england    sorry you got rejected by a burger hottie
miami
  if you cant find quality women in a population of 325 million then theyre not the problem you are
its ironic how western guys who go to other countries especially in asia because they think western women are garbage usually attract the lowest of the low kinds of women in the country they escape to im sure its similar in other east asian countries but the type of girls that date foreigners in korea are just trash not all of them of course but theyre usually the foreign hunting ones that youll find on tinder or dive bars in foreign districts and they usually suffer from severe depression and mental issues yet these naive foreign guys put up with dating them because they think all asian women are the complete antithesis of western women so they must be high quality right people who complain more about those around them than introspecting and improving themselves will always be surrounded by those kinds no matter where they are
  its a well known phenomenon
  wakanda you should move there
  this i know plenty if women who arent retarded
  why couldnt i have been born dutch
more importantly which one has the best legal/decriminalised prostitutes so far ive only had three in amsterdam and all of them were beautiful except the blatantly fat and black ones ive heard the ones in hamburg are even better
  the reason for why amsterdam has the best prostitutes is because the dutch government has limited the amount of windows available for prostitutes this in combination with a lot of prostitutes wanting to work in amsterdam due to the traffic being the largest in the world and thus highest potential for revenue means that a lot of women want to work in amsterdam far higher than the amount of windows available this results in only the top shelf being chosen to work in the windows    sure you have specific windows that are designated for fetishes such as blue lights transgenders and fat black women but those make money because they are so low in supply so people flock to those out of fetishism anyway
  be expat  go to foreign country for work  try dating  all women are trash so i reject them and stay alone this is normal for me  go back to my tiny european village for christmas  some stranger posts on our local facebook trying to meet women  think good luck only sluts would be up for this  suddenly realize why i couldnt get a decent date in my home away from home    oh well one more downside of traveling
    i noticed the prostitutes are always much uglier than normal everyday women you see walking about its so pathetic to pay 50 euros to fuck an uggo because you cannot get the real deal for free better to use your hand
  also once on a night train i helped an iranian prostitute who had just arrived to her destination weirdest stranger interaction in my life 18 year old me with this dolled up 40 year old woman weird shit
  this
  lol no its rare to see a nice dutch girl
  are your high nigga
    elaborate
  people do travel there just to fuck these prostitutes yes its easy but how can you say theyre ugly most of them are solid 9s or 10s
the one you have with you
  the worst part was that there is a total disconnect between sex and romance in japan its expected for you and the girl to have sex outside of the relationship as its just physical while romance is something else    this is greatly exaggerated fidelity in relationships is still expected although people certainly do cheat recently a minister had to resign for cheating on his spouse for example i think it was just your girlfriend trying to manipulate you
  the culture encourages independent thought discourages unquestioning loyalty to family    thats not necessarily a positive pushed to this extreme it only results in atomized individuals i prefer a middleground
  i agree overall but korea is a bad example as korean culture specifically looks down on dating foreigners
  nope if you have the money you can pay for top class escorts that are far above the average they dont advertise on windows though
serbia has the highest average ive ever seen a 5/10 in serbia is a 657/10 in germany the netherlands france etc
  ukraine and russia
          lmfao
itt  desperate buttblasted mutts and euros who dont realize every firstie is 3/10 overseas
  the only women i know who arent retarded and insufferable are related to me
  go to the north idk maybe tall pale blondes are not your thing       it was on the last train she didnt know what train to take and of all the people around she decided to ask me possibly because i was the less threatening man and the only foreigner on the platform anyway i get her on the right train which was the same as mind and she sits adjacent to me and between nagging me about her arrival and asking questions about the country it was like we were some dysfunctional weird couple then everyone else was snickering silently and not so silently about the whole ordeal then her pimp calls and she is talking very loudly in broken english about where she is and he is telling her the particular everyone is in on the conversation then she left for some time afterwards i thought probably another human trafficking victim i was 18 and new to the country myself      im was just saying the women in the windows are less pretty than the women walking about      if you want to pay 300 euros for a prostitute you can get good thigh anywhere nothing special about amsterdam
  some of the kinkiest sluts ive ever fucked where american girls i chained up and fucked in the arse and they loved it one of them brought her own chain hot as hell too tall slim red head with stacked tits    then there are the others  but kink requires decadence and usa is good for that
  maybe youre right about the north but in amsterdam the only girls that are hot are tourists and even then theyre rarely as hot never mind hotter than the prozzies
i have been scientifically evaluating this question for many years and doing much field research every city i go to i count how many 8 girls i see    the winner was shenzhen in china with 94 8/10s spotted     europe has some decent talent in places like denmark and holland but all thr fatties/feminist types lower the average    asian women are objectively more attractive they are always skinny always dress skimpily and show a lot of skin their faces age slower than other races and they have ridiculous facial rejuvenation routines    however i hear dating asian women can have some draw backs many are materialistic and can start off sweet but eventually turn possessive    i used to not like asian girls that much until i went to asia theres just a ridiculous amount of hot girls there its too bad they dont have blue/green eyes tho
  sorry i should note 94 in one day
  are u me
  quality bait american women are good for fucking but probably the worst choice for starting a family generally speaking
  how do you know you didnt count a whole bunch of them twice
  asians are more consistently a 6/10 but they rarely go higher than that    meanwhile in the west you have actual very high quality women if you are an ugly guy that wants to settle for a 6/10 then yeah asia is your best bet if you actually want high quality women both in appearance and personality then youll need to be in the west
  especially if you want to be able to differentiate them from other women and not be a trophy husband
  checkd and cried
  ugly guy  settle for a 6/10  your standards are too highly inflated  the world average is about a 3 ugly the women in your image are 677
i think it really depends on what youre looking for in a wife some people say western women are all garbage and then you talk to someone from vietnam or ukraine who will say their women are now spoiled by materialistic views and so on its all really based on the individual not every japanese girl will be meek and obedient while not every brazilian girl will be super outgoing and full of life    so are we discussing stereotypes here
  
  677  pointy elbows post an 8 and 9
  autistic but necessary
  aussie women from small towns not the cities are very easygoing and often racist too as a bonus
  that israeli girl sounds like a keeper
  white girls rarely go above a 6 they lack the gracile physiques of arabs and blacks    north african women in particular are consistently 7s and 8s
finland had the best women ive seen walking around helsinki every girl i saw was beautiful and i actually got fit matches on tinder which doesnt happen normally
  ugly guy  settle for a 6/10    does this ever happen got any examples
  nice blog post fag
  for example in my country a taller women with a shorter man is a common sight  which country is that i want an amazon to drag me around on a leash
  sex outside the relationship    this is blatantly untrue sorry man but your gf was legit just a whore you pick her up in gaspanic or something
american women can be enjoyable and pleasant once you filter out the 80 obese ones get higher status and improve yourself    this is in the tacoma/seattle area hope you like art hoes    to answer your question from personal exp  vladivostok/saint petersburg   busan/seoul  auckland
for my personal taste and i talk about girla i know and i have date i will say russian girls then could be italy/ukrania or colombia
im going to travel around asia next year starting in japan/korea and then around other parts of it for a year i have enough money to pay for myself and take someone with me how do i get myself some dates set up in japan/korea that would quickly turn into something more where i could get the girl to travel with me long term i dont plan on living in those countries but girls from there who i met on other travels were always pretty cool
  i assume you put european in your bio
    
i think japan has the best looking women but personality wise its a bit hit or miss  theres alot of depressed crazy shallow girls here  and i want to emphasize the word shallow it feels like none of them have any interests or hobbies outside of shopping eating and travelling   having said that visited estonia years back and i thought the women there were off the chart
  japan has the worst looking women on the planet besides aboriginals their personalities are abhorrent as well    only the most desperate guys tend to go for jap girls they are extremely materialistic and they honestly feel like sociopaths maximizing the amount of resources they will drain out of their partner    i know this is true as well in china from hearsay but ive only been to japan so i cant comment about other asian countries however japanese women were by far the most materialistic people ive ever seen i didnt even realized people like this existed
  i notice that everyone bases their opinions off the women living in the largest cities eg tokyo or shanghai modern urban living turns just about anyone into a materialistic slave and isnt a good metric for passing judgment on an entire race/nation
  im american actually from tacoma i just have a lot of pics in foreign places when i lived abroad and i speak a few languages     pic related
  if you think jap girls are the most materialistic youll be in a world of shock with south korean girls
  whats wrong with your face
  this is   i live in hokkaido and been with a ton of girls since being here i havnt noticed them being materialistic not saying their personalities are unanimously unmaterialistic or even great for that matter but i sure as hell havnt noticed what your talking about  i did meet and date for a long time a girl who totally subverted the traits i mentioned there are diamonds in the rough and actually i dont think they are that rare
  i lived in japan for a couple of years and had a longterm japanese girlfriend what is really weird about japanese women is that they never truly show their feelings they are overly materialistic and expect you to pay for everything like she is your pet or something the worst part was that there is a total disconnect between sex and romance in japan its expected for you and the girl to have sex outside of the relationship as its just physical while romance is something else i thought that was very creepy i broke up when she started to demand my entire salary should be deposited on her bank account and she would give me allowance to life off of from my own salary fuck that    most of those things mostly only apply to dumb bimbos which is 90 of what any foreigner will get     except for the last part that shit is fucked i know a guy who wants to get a divorce but his wife wont let him apparently in japan if only one party wants a divorce you need to live separately for 3 years for it to be recognized she also still has control over his bank account as is common in most japanese households so he is living in a shitty one person apartment eating cup ramen every day while his wife has all the money
so ive booked an impromptu 7 day trip to athens next week   what are the tourist traps what is genuinely worth doing
  a trip to exarchia where you can hangout with the local anarchists in between their firebombing attacks on police stations and rioting/looting universities
  that does sound pretty based
athens   seven days     kek
    dont forget to book a hotel in vibrant and diverse omonia square where you might have the chance to get culturally enriched    jokes aside 3 days are plenty to see the main museums and archeological sites there should be a ticket covering several all around the city for like 10 euros your hotel should have some leaflets of tour operators organizing day trips to olympia and delphi mt lykabettus and the bottom of the plaka have the best views of the akropolis
  this you fucked up athens is one of the most run down shitholes of a city in all of europe i remember seeing people literally shitting on some town square in the center as well as a line of 15 junkies shooting up 300 meters from parliament aside from how shitty the city is there is nothing to see for 7 fucking days there
getting stabbed by an angry golden dawn member because they think youre why they had their house seized by a bank
    come on if op is from the states then athens is already nicer and safer than most places back home there are enough museums and archeological sites to keep him busy for days assuming he has actually interested in history and art worst case if he really really hates the place just fly/train to thessaloniki and spend 34 days in there
i have a week in athens in february  want to get out to some island for a couple of days  which one
lemme hijack your thread op    are there ferries from athens to the islands is there a website or ferry map somewhere i dont want to fly not because of fear or anything i just like the idea of going around the aegean sea by passenger ferry
  heres a very helful shit i found   its about santorini specifically but i imagine everything applies to other islands as well
    knock yourself out lots of amazing and unique islands are only reachable by ferry anyway so most people use them i think flights are more common in the very popular destinations crete santorini mykonos rhodes zakynthos etc      february isnt high season so dont expect to go partying in the popular islands beyond that it depends on what you really want to see different island groups have different cultures and things to see for very short trips from athens most people go to hydra where cars are prohibited to relax but assuming you have 3 days to spend for islands you could go to one of the aegean ones with flights you can go to islands further away though but it really depends on what you want to see
    thanks friends gonna start planning some island hopping then i plan to do it next spring
7 days is far too many delphi is pretty nice for a daytrip also most if not all musuems and archaeological sites are free if youre a student at least that was the case for me during summer
  im going to spend at least 3 of them doing day trips i think    i fucking love museums
indeed7 days are too manybut you can go on a trip to nayplio and epidayrosless than 2 hours tripor if u can take more than two days off athens go to olympia or delphi as people above mentionedthen in athens must visit acropolisits museumthe cemetary of kerameikossecond most important archeological site aftee acropolis  good places to go for a drink or food are exarchiametaxourgeio and pagrati with xalandrisyntagma monasthrakidefinitely visit lykavetos hillespecially in the nightdont go to thiseio or in the tourist bouzouki mousaka gyros shops around plakathiseio or psirithey will rip yoy off

  how many times do we have to have this thread  also real people stay in guesthouses/hotels dont argue about cunts when you yourself belong to that group youre all deplorables fkn backpackers
americans with canadian flag patches sewn onto their rucksacks    do americans still do this i havent been to a hostel for 10 years but this was very much the done thing before obama made it ok to be american
  dont even see canadians do it that much anymore honestly
  something odd that i do  some feedback would be good     im a 28 amerifat and still stay in hostels while i work in tech my passion is cooking and traveling for new techniques and recipes i then go to local markets and try to cook the meal in the communal kitchen  usually servicing 6 random people    is this weird
  if youre being obnoxious braggish or just loud about it yes otherwise it might be a bit weird but only an autist would ever hold it against you
  ive heard local people laughing about this everywhere from bali to the sahara theres no better way to advertise that youre an american with expensive camera equipment
  no seems fun and id join you
    leaf here    my redneck cousins still do this bullshit but theyre travelling less do to the felonies so the problem is fixing itself    i feel like having a flag of any developed country in your stuff screams steal me    canadian luggage tags are still a thing though especially with boomers
26 year old american here staying in a hostel for the first time this week in spain what can i expect   im a well groomed tall guy with a business job
  they do met two canadian dudes in dubrovnik a week ago as they were renting a car there and we were returning ours
  i mean canadians do
  dude thats weird i just sit in the corner drinking cheap beer staring at my phone and then go right to bed right after i want people to talk to me not have to talk to them
  itl be fun you meet other people who travel and you can join them in activities
  very cool im excited my hostel was a gift so im thinking of taking a day to go to the french riviera and also a day for madrid does my bed remain mine i payed for it but i dont know what the protocol is
  youll get stuck in a room with a bunch of english lads on tour
  t cranky guitar guy who was kept awake all night by the 60 year old snorer
  yes the bed remains your for the duration of your stay
  implying guitar guys want to stay in single rooms i do not think so
busts out my gretsch country gentleman fender hot rod deville and my 12 pedal pedal board out in the middle of the common room and start shoegazing it up
  who is a zoomer
  lmao its not implying that at all its stating guitar boi is annoyed and making tedious rants on vietnamese basket weaving forums because hes tired
  t backpacker with a complex
  you forgot    the guy who judges everyone quietly thinking hes better and goes home the same faggot he was before
the cunt whos only sense of self worth in life is how many countries hes been to so tries to oneup any story anyone in the hostel tells with how something he did was better
the guy from manchester   seriously everywhere i go i meet somebody from there the worst part is for whatever reason i get on really well with brits and inevitably end up doing things with them a lot
  60 year old  zoomer  pick one
  why is this a bad thing
  hey thats me
that pretentious conversation between two people comparing all of the countries theyve been
  because brits suck
  and you get along so well with us says a lot about you doesnt it
31 thinking of staying in a hostel in bordeaux for two nights in november before i head to saintèmilion for a couple days of wine day drinking 31 too old or is the whole bordeaux vibe older
  people of all ages stay in hostels so long as you arent a creepy weirdo nobody will mind talking to you
that guy who reads kerouac books in the corner
  are you belgian by any chance
  in the desert somewhere weeping quietly because you dont have internet
  its just a weird coincidence more than anything i dont mind it really     not me homes but hes not entirely wrong     nope american
the only time i stayed in a hostel was in budapest i got a private room and one of the girls in the next room over left a bloody period pad in our shared bathroom never again
  welcome to the real world sometimes something falls on the floor sometimes someone forgets something  i wonder how you make it outside your door with that persecution complex  oh yeah you dont
  virgin post right here
  youre training yourself to be a better cook and thats a really cool way to do it good luck on your quest
    welcome to the real world  in the real world people dont leave their fucking period blood in a public space if you think thats normal then you are clearly on the same level as these rotten slobs lmao if you want to share your space with greasy unwashed skanks then go ahead but ill get a hotel room next time

  yeah married to your hand you fucking virgo
  to socialise human contact with new people can be fun anon try it some time
  i dont know many staying with a bunch of smelly trust fund kids trying to find themselves seems like hell to me    ill stick to airbnb
  the price is right    and many of them are very interesting places with far more character than a common hotel room
  go to a foreign country to be immersed in their culture  decide to stay in this country in a cramped common room with no locals and a bunch of people that are probably from your own country  i cant even to comprehend what goes through hostelniggers heads
  hostels have completely convinced me that about 70 of the human population needs to be shoahed
  why you faggots thought that weakness groveling and all around faggotry made it ok to be an american ill never understand     you should have been aborted
  not at all youre a garden variety bugman its your nature
  anyone over 30 staying at a hostel completely failed at life
  hostel phags
  before these two men i was afraid to sport my maple leaf flag on my bag less my fellow bugmen perceive me of being a nationalist
  being rich enough to live at 5 star hotels  coming to 4chan to brag about it
going to sofia in a month do i stay in a hostel or a hotel
  hostel  on a tight budget  want to meet people to see the place with    hotel  not on as tight a budget  want to do things alone in more comfort
  you examine the web thorougly like a man of the world and get the guesthouse or the airbnb room that costs you as little as the bunk bed in a hostel full of smelly snorers you spend part of the nights surfing porn and fapping like a grown man would win/win
    fuck it im just gonna couch surf
  not bragging at all just a fact i grew out of hostels when i was oh 22 had set goals in life reached them tbh many of the people ive met in hostels over 35 years old are washed up and aimless reminds me of the over 45 esl teachers in asia just feel sad for them
    air bnb the prime choice for people scared of meeting other people on holiday who want to spend their holiday evenings fapping in a strangers bedroom
  auscunt here    i only wear my canadian tshirt when going to gay bars true story
  my brother is a fucking lunatic who dad pays for to travel to third world countries all year long so he can keep him away from home and my step mum who despises him  he was bragging at xmas about all the airbnbs he stayed in he would take a shit in the cistern like goose and want into any shampoo bottles  fucking ruined abnb for me i hate him so much
be real with me bros im horny and lonely what are the odds i can find a qt girl to hookup with/be my practice gf at a hostel
  you have clearly never been in or cleaned a womans restroom before
  im 23 and i do that  people just add whatever they happen to have it usually involves drinking and ends well
staying in the czech republic for a few days  cant decide whether to airbnb hostel or hotel  money not an issue    im by myself if that makes any difference
  youd have a better chance on couchsurfers desu that thing is just a gloried hookup app nowadays
  airbnb  managed to nick quite a few items there and dispute the security deposit
  its all about having the money or not you can stay in hostels even if you hate most other people who stay there if you can afford staying in good hotels at age 22 you must be either a succesful entrepeneur have rich parentes or do really short trips    and yes you are bragging you fucking idiot
  being disgusted by something natural   ive fucked my ex multiple times on her period rawdog
  so you wouldnt mind fucking her while she was covered in her own shit shit is also natural
  what is anal sex for 500 alex
first time staying at a hostel and just time traveling by myself what am i in for pic related is the other guests
  based
  all anglos and some koreans  which city    what am i in for  depends what you make of it either a really good time where you meet friends or a shit time where you just resent staying with others
  city   lisbon over christmas
not even kidding canadians are less likeable than americans 78 of the time   it is pretty funny just how much people tend to break down in stereotypical groups in hostels smelly hippies ex drug addicts rich kids lost kids that are sick of the road but just dont want to go home know it all pretentious travellers world weary couples the mysterious way too pretty to be travelling alone women lolol
  are you good at socializing if so near 100 i genuinely believe hostels are the easiest place in the world to be a whore man or woman
  canadians are the exact same as americans but theyve developed a superiority complex
  so would you recommend staying at a hostel over a nice hotel or airbnb if money isnt any issue at all    t traveling alone soon to a foreign country
  are you good at socializing
  yes but it really is a 50/50 thing it depends on the hostel ie is there places to hang out inside or outside can you drink alcohol can people get away with smoking weed there/closeby is there a pool/pingpong table etc these sort of things are no guarantees of it being fun hostel but they do really help your odds   then it depends on the people cheap hostels attract the party kid backpackers but they can also attract 40yo immigrant workers etc fancier hostels can have more cool shit to do but also attract more uptight travellers who are following their itinerary and are more likely to be in bed early and not hanging out then its just luck of the draw one week you can have a whole group of cool people next week its boring asf   end of the day ive been both the in bed at 8pm get in get out person and the guy up all night partying stayed in very different hostels in very 1st and 3rd world countries usually been alone and always preferred hostels for the innate communal side   dont get me wrong hostels can be painfully uncomfortable places sometimes but at the same time being alone in hotel and you havent spoken to anyone in days isnt exactly pleasant  you arent guaranteed to meet cool people at a hostel but your odds really do increase 10 fold compared to just staying in hotels     to me if money was no issue id stick to hostels in places were i knew i was spending a few days or more coz it gives you a change to not just meant but hang out with people then stick to hotels in transient 1 night type stops coz you may as well get a good nights sleep if your a bit pressed for time like that
  even if your not an overly social person i still find its still worth hanging out in the communal areas of a hostel its the only way to meet people easily and even if you dont talk to anyone its kind of interesting or even good fun just overhearing other peoples conversations
  tfw duffel bag has canada stitched on the side    will i get robbed      that was foon ighnnit      id say its more of a passiveaggressive complex cause of social pressure to be a polite all the time  we think its a better version of america yet were insecure about being too american
im 29  is that too old for hostals  i look early twenties if i shave many people guessed that
  not at all most people in most hostels are 2535 and more older than that than youd expect  basically cos under 25s might more or less exclusively stay in hostels but theres just not all that many under 25s travelling compared the number or over 25s travelling
  im going to ask you alot of questions only a canadian would know and i will rob you if you answer wrong
well now i think about it theres plenty 2125 yos in most hostels but theres equally as many people round your age and older
  lmao this is actually accurate    always some cunt from the north who wants to get drunk and doesnt speak a word of the language but whos been there for ages    good blokes tbqh
  lmao i have unironically done this    fuck airbnb
  if you are travelling one its the only way to go    dorms make it shitty if youre earning cash reas not a student get yourself a private room  youll miss out on a little banter but in my experience the sleep makes it worth it    the trick about travelling alone is that you arrive alone but you meet people along the way its way makes it fun
  never to old unironically
19yo staying in my first hostel in brisbane soonhopefully get some funny stories from it

mannn some major autists on this board    heres the go to guide on hostels vs hotels from a real traveler     low budget travelling alone  stay in a cheap hostel not the cheapest one cause it may be unbearably bad but whatever has a rating of 7 or above on bookingcom or whatever you use     low budget travelling with gf/friends   go to the same kind of hostel but book a private room and split the price or if there are enough of you book out a 4/6 person dorm     medium budget solo traveler  book a nice hostel with good reviews and that looks nice in the pictures and is close to city center or even a private room if you can afford it    medium budget travelling with gf/friends  get an air bnb or private room in a nice hostel    high budget solo traveler   stay wherever you want i guess but hostels are still the best way to meet people if you are by yourself if you have a lot of money tho maybe get a room at the ritz and some hookers for company    high budget traveling with gf or friends  get a nice room at fancey hotel     tldr if you are travelling solo hostels are the way to go and the best way to meet people if you are in a group or with your gf get a private room so you can smash that pus/circle jerk together     also i dont think age is an issue in hostels im only 24 but i see all sorts of ages in hostels if you are worried about your age just try shave and change your clothes often so you atleast dont seem creepy/weird to the young kids
  theyre often visited by people who have very recent and accurate information about recent conditions in certain areas which is otherwise hard to come by    depending on what kind of activities this information pertains to it can actually save your ass
28 and going to barcelona booked a hotel did i fuck up lads
    not too old at all as long as you can fit in and play nice with anyone under 25 are of a carefree disposition and dont have a dirty old man vibe going on youre good to go if youre older you will be quite welcome if you are well traveled too and can give tips and some good anecdotes about your travels    youll know if youre ready to stop going to hostels if you stop enjoying them yourself and/or people think you work there
i really dont like weedbros so i generally just go walking on my lonesome to meet nonhostel people and do nonweed things
  european hostels are great american hostels suck dick
  still going to hostels at 22  lmao what a failure i was self made trillionare at age 3 posting from jupiter atm
  thats not what i said i was done with hostels at 22 last hostel i was in was the kinley hostel in galway that experience broke me along with sitting in economy on a laxnrt flight with delta about a month later i swore to myself id never sit in the back of a plane nor stay in a hostel so far so good
  you sound like a virgin freak to be desu
  well hey thats how it goes
  galway is good fun desu    too much drinking for burgers though    t irishfag
  good post that will be ignored by the autists
  i was there at the same time as the trampoline gymnastics championship or something like that and they had booked most of the hostel along with their fans  the amount of autism mixed in with people who didnt bathe did me in
  fair enough bad timing desu
homeless people who live in the hostel and are fucking weird
are hostels primarily for backpackers only is taking some small luggage frowned upon im just staying in one because its cheaper than the airbnb in japan and i only intend to be there to sleep
  no people bring luggage too but i cant think of a scenario outside of bringing gear to hike or dive with what do you need to bring that requires luggage
  clothes dont plan on wearing the same shit every day and to bring shit back in its not like a massive piece of luggage more like 1/2 the size of a large one
  and of course no one replies to the most valid criticism of hostels in the thread not to mention that the majority of the people there are only in the country to party/get drunk and will be loud as fuck until late into the morning hostels are for people who enjoy traveling ie getting drunk at bars and doing nothing interesting that cant be done in their own country
   whats wrong with the kinley
  yeah thats completely fine      waaaaa people dont travel how i think they should waaaaaaaa
  oh nothing it is one of the best hostels ive been to it was the fact it was overtaken by a convention of trampoline experts and their smelly fan base that caused me to give up hostels at 22 years old location is excellent cleaning standards are much higher than other similar hostels staff are top notch i still work with one of their managers on side projects for university groups
    nah man id be super stoked to be staying somewhere and have an experience like that
ive only stayed in a shareplace once the guy we were with kept trying to talk to the foreigners and be overly australian even though he was an inner city little bitch it was so fucking cringe
  why are trampolinists smelly wouldnt that smell up the trampoline also how did you go to a hostel and end up getting in business with them you just pull them to the side and give your idea
  lol it was the fan base that stunk im a international group travel consultant so i send her university groups from time to time
  heres the go to guide on hostels vs hotels from a real traveler     for me it completely depends on the area/country of travel in japan i almost always stay in hostels with business hotels if just going around the us better fucking believe it is a 9/10 hostel or for sure a hotel
just booked 3 nights in a hostel the virgins in this thread are seething
  nofap  poor  enjoy
  hostels are for people who  just need a place to sleep no thrills  probably traveling light dont need to much baggage outside a suitcase  backpack  most likely staying outside the hostel 90 of the time  people who are extroverts and not introverts  doesnt need complete privacy to sleep      i use them because they are cheap i am outgoing dont care to just laze on bed most of the day and just need a place to sleep i can pay 20 dollars a night for some good enough stay and put more money into trying new things or extending my vacation they arent for everyone but if you are fine with just seeming them as a cheap sleep go for it though in asia you can generally get a business hotel that isnt downtown for 30 usd which isnt that much more than a hostel
  needing to fap  sign of a virgin    poor  no i just enjoy the company of others
is bringing a big luggage frowned upon in hostels i was planning to bring a 28 luggage for my month and a half trip in asia during the winter
  no most all hostels dont care just check it in behind the counter anything you think is too much baggage wait till you see some asian women travel
  mate you should see what girls bring when travelling literally 2 massive rucksacks of stuff per woman    youll be fine
    i dont understand this thread are hostels bad i stayed in a hostel for 15 dollars a night in kyoto i didnt really interact with the other patrons i used it as a home base while i got drunk and biked around the city once i spent all day sleeping     guess im a dick 45 dollars for 3 days was cheap as shit and the concierge was a badass that was nice as hell showers were clean the kitchen was stocked and fine what did i miss
     oh yea he had pikey 3 11 tattood on the top of his hands     pikey because he enjoys the thought of traveling life of a gypsy 3/11 because its the date of tsunami / earthquake     some intrepid traveler go find this guy hes very friendly
  hostels are fine they just get shat on by anons here because someone did 0 reading of reviews on a place and it sucked someone somewhere booked a cheap ass end place in buttfuck all europe or slumville south america and it went to shit so thus all hostels are that way all the hostels i stay in i look at reviews on hostelworld and look at the pictures and such for anything indicating a shit time     i wouldnt recommend them for everyone but they are fine so long as you arent expecting hotel level service japanese hostels are also stupidly different compared to the rest of the world i dont think id compare them to other countries
  go to the same kind of hostel but book a private room and split the price    i always cop that private room when possible      in delhi some  sikh was talking loud as fuck on his phone at 5am in the dorm i told  him he was being an asshole to which he replied ill fuck your ass lol     another time a guy was watching porn on his phone fapping fuck that shit     always gotta get the room if possible i always appreciate a privacy curtain too     another nice one is solid beds where you dont feel the other persons movement i never have a good sleep in hostels
  no but are hostels are trash if there other options i dont see the appeals  of hostels anymore
  im canadian and wish inwas american i fucking hate canada
  people romanticise tinkers    lmao
  i struggled hard to find good hostels in a lot of india seemed to be mostly for domestic transient workers ended up staying mostly in super host air bnbs for about the same price as a private hostel room
  r u rightwinger
  india is so cheap i couldnt resist staying in a nice place because i can it would be extremely difficult for me to rationalize sleeping in a dorm when theres hotels and airbnbs for dirt cheap  kinda unrelated my grandpa worked with mother teresa in 1980s calcutta his room was literally 25 cents a night lmao
  the nice places where like 300 to 600aud a night which was way out of my price range ate at the restaurants a few times though when i wanted an up market interpretation of the regional cuisine even with drinks it was between 25 and 45aud
  where
  bhubaneswar kochi and chenai
  cheap  passable cleanliness/amenities if you get the right one  advice from fellow whipipo on what to do/where to go  socialization    unless youve planned your entire trip already and know a couple people to hang out with hostels are the way to go
  the patrician choicd
  this when i was 19 in medellin i met a 36 year old british guy at a hostel who was staying there while looking for a place to buy probably the best time i had in my life got tons of advice on clubs and other cities and when i wasnt partying he showed me around the city
  fucking cunts the doasyoulikeys
    this im willing to socialize with anyone but not where i plan to sleep and shit
    im 25 and not too into hostels anymore but i think its stupid to judge older people who stay in them one of the coolest guys i met while traveling was a 40somethingyear old australian engineer hed gotten divorced saved a ton of money and decided pretty spurofthemoment to hitchhike to portugal he had to boathop through indonesia go overland through afghanistan bunch of other shit     told me and a german guy that he had a good budget and would sometimes stay in midrange or 5star hotels but would occasionally book hostels so he could socialize and speak in english     the dude had a couple of lateteen/earlytwentysomething girls clearly craving his dick     anyway the way i see it i dont think theres anything wrong with hostels but if im in a nonwhite nonanglo country i dont wanna hang out with anglo people unless i cant find locals plus im a light sleeper the biggest reason why ive started using airbnb to book whole apartments more than dorms is because im a light sleeper and am fucking sick of assholes coming back into dorms flipping on light switches at 4am having conversations with their buddies when everyone else in the room is asleep etc
  where do the onebaggers with 5k worth of gear in a single backpack stay
in south america there are loads of over 30s in hostels  i think thats more to do with the destination being somewhere you would generally visit when older sea is babbys first travel experience for instance and i think i would hate to be in a hostel there in most instances as a result  ive met a lovely couple who were retired and travelling around in hostels in eastern europe because they enjoyed meeting people   dont be so judgemental
  i dont know where i came off as judgemental i too have met relatively welladjusted older people at hostels anecdotal but the majority of the older people i spoke with were aimless and not the kind i would find myself associating with ill take the company of a businessman staying at a high end chain rather than an esl lifer at a hostel just personal preference
  does this count i dont even know why i took a photo of him
  i cant imagine paying to fly to a country then spending the absolute minimal on lodging food and experiences hostel fags are the absolute worst     posted from my 700 euro a night castle in ireland
  ireland  700 euro     you couldnt pay me to stay in potato land
  its canadians that do this in scotland just to show that theyre not americans theyre the absolute worst
stay in hostel for first time in amsterdam  just me and 5 girls i dont know in the room for some reason  they notice me watch them paint their toenails and stuff   later onhey anon why do you keep staring at our feet  two of them strip off their shoes and socks and put their bare soles in my face   run out and sneak back in later after a few hours to gather my things while theyre out partying    i still dont know if i did the right thing
  they were just being playful all you had to say was reference them painting their nails its not weird  youre fine
  hey anon why do you keep staring at our feet
is 28 too old for a hostel
  no age is too old for a hostel nothing wrong with being frugal im 27 and saving for a down payment on a house in seattle so i shave off costs wherever i can especially on frivolous things like accommodations
  dude i stopped staying in hostels when i was 6 months old kys you failure
  no i just hate canada
  really there are chain  hostels now zostel has a bunch all the main tourist spots that said i always preferred a guest house or hotel the price is cheap enough in calcutta i stayed at the ywca it was so great really old building my room had 15 foot ceiling looking out on to a clay tennis court hadnt changed since the 30s cheap and great    another cool hostel was in chennai called broadlands it was popular in the 60s and before that was a brothel nice old building charm that cant be replaced by modern hostels
  why not both
  they sound based to me
  chennai i did eventually find one the red balloon which was a generic hip backpakers you find everywhere in the worldi saw the ywca but a bit of an average review score when i looked at the actual reviews it had really bad reviews by westerners about security and cleanliness so i gave it a miss sounds interesting so its a shame i missed out but my air bnb homestays where amazing so no real loss i just used hostelworld and bookingcom so maybe i missed the chains on there
  lol your mistake is checking reviews i didnt have a phone so i just rocked up you know its easy to go to a place and look around and then decide tripadvisor is bullshit

at my first hostel in japan right now  so far 70 of the people here have no idea what to do with their life and are just escaping reality with mom/dads money or just scraping by  just had a girl tell me how she hates how snobby her rich father is while 5 minutes later saying she only shops at mom and pop shops and has never used amazon once in her life
    all anglos  beach city in europe  oh boi
  aw no youre like a travel dad id love to meet someone like you while travelling
  sounds like an easy bang for ya
i dont get hostel travellers for 300350 euro you can book a business hotel for a week in most japanese cities you get a bathroom for your own when you get diarrhea or need to puke from all the booze and you get a breakfast buffet where you can stuff yourself so you dont have to eat lunch two meals meaning about 15 euros saved every single day  if a hostel gets any cheaper than that then only marginally and its not nearly as comfortable or convenient
  imagine traveling all the way to japan just to pinch pennies and substitute the countrys delicacies with shitty hotel breakfast in effort to save a bit of cash its not even like food in japan is expensive in the first place
  you can still eat proper restaurant food in the evenings and you get a whole lot more privacy and dont have to deal with retards

    i recommend using the chat up line ill pop in your mom store    let us know how it goes

has somebody been at hostels in japan    i got some ryokans on rural areas but would you recommend hostels in tokyo kyoto and hiroshima
  trust fund kids are definitely in the minority at hostels those people stay in hotels and airbnbs you dumbass
  i motorbiked across vietnam on a win and exclusively stayed in hostels and guest houses i guarantee you havent done that you bitter nerd nerd
  holy shit look at the oil slick in the water
  shit id drink you under the table throw your unconscious body over my shoulder leave you asleep in your room and pillage your mini bar on teh way out the door
  owl in tokyo is pretty good if you like to meet people and drink
hostels are really poorhouses for people that would still like to see another country yes some of the occupants are trustcrusts uppermiddle class children of petty bourgeoisie wearing silly pants and filthmatted long hair and redditors still most people choose hostels out of necessity its that or live and die in your podunk town at one mcjob or another    not everyone has parents and houses to flop in rentfree until theyre done with university
really dont get why would your stay in a hostel instead of airbnb if youre a maniac who likes to share rooms you can also do that
  lisbon  beach  for christmas  wew
consideres himself a traveller  meets other travellers  plebs
    hostels dont cost as much give you more chance to make friends while traveling and are more geared towards people who want to actually see the city or wherever theyre staying in rather than just wank in a strangers bedroom    i dont get why anyone would want to stay in an airbnb even choosing an airbnb over a regular bnb seems like a dumb move as the breakfasts at a real bed and breakfast are obviously going to be much better
  do bnbs actually exist from my experience its extremely rare when breakfast is included on airbnb its obviously never included  the reasons to stay in airbnb are 1 you get to know ordinary peoples life better as youre staying at someones actual home instead of a hostel with backpackers 2 price depends on the country of course in some countries its not cheap but in others its a godsend for example in the us you can find rooms for as low as 3040 per day good like finding anything for that price in new york or seattle where even hostel dorms can cost up to 50
      virgins
  pours derision on virgins that live like patricians own rooms  sleeps in a cockfest dorm  has no money  does not compute you cant even afford to go on a date
  jokes on you buddy ive been drinking all week
    there are shit tons of bed and breckfasts in britain in plymouth torquey paignton and other places in devon there are entire roads where every building is a large house that has been converted to a privately run bb where you get a full english breakfast included i expect it is the same most other places in the uk that are popular for family holidays
  yyoure not a virgin freak so you must be poor  haha this cope

  youre poor  oh hun if only you knew yes that is a 50

dumb question but do you people have sex in the hostel or what where do you bang them    t only stays in hotels but wanna travel cheaper
  happened many times in my room and 100 of the time everyone will tell them to fuck off get a love hotel private room or at least go to the bathroom if you really cant go a night without pussy

  lol i just got back from a trip to manchester today    its not that bad but the amount of crazies/homeless people was the highest ive seen in europe    stayed in a hostel as well filled with irish slags who didnt have a single interesting story to tell
  the fuck are you gonna do about it  ill throw ice cold water on you like the dogs you are
ive only stayed at a hostel dorm once usually get private rooms and it was in shithole bucharest best time i spent in an otherwise dogshit trip    half asian/brit guy with massive detailed cross tattoo on his back total pussyhound but wellspoken  iranian expat training to become a dentist super proud of persian history with several tats of ancient scripture and landmarks fucking hates the islamic theocracy mightve been gay cause he was real friendly  somalianborn norwegian with romanian qt gf real down to earth and humble respectful    i felt like the most milquetoast guy there being a basic bitch on vacation im soon off to poland though and i accidentally booked a no cancellation hostel room that i later realize has mediocre reviews lots of shit about lack of cleanliness hot water and noise pray for me lads
  because its a depressing shithole like the rest of the north  not if you live in the lake distict    actually yes it is its so fucking boring

tfw complete fucking loser  tfw poor    guess ill just wait until i become rich then
  not that guy but the strategy is sound    essentially youre avoiding hostels where youre most likely to come in contact with basic backpackers the ones that left home on a 2k budget stink like shit and are headed straight for all the wonders of the world    highvolume hostel means youll get a shitty meme lodging and for only a few bucks more you may as well do air bnb
i spent three years backpacking hated the guitar guys in the hostels those cunts were always so full of themselves and usually had one or two mentally unstable girls hovering around them    im planning on developing an app for backpackers an extreme tinder version that only shows people currently in the same hostel as you would you use it
  i do dont really care whos around desu i try to be courteous but it usually gets pretty intense if someone else is bangin in the room i never give a shit as long as they finish within a reasonable time say 30 mins its part of the territory
  im planning on developing an app for backpackers an extreme tinder version that only shows people currently in the same hostel as you would you use it    no half the fun is the chase plus getting laid at a hostel is like shooting fish in a barrel if it were any easier it wouldnt be fun and ive been to some huge hostels usually if someone is down to party you catch them at some point during the day or night anyways keep thinking breh
  i have no friends
  they always play the worst songs and have a terrible guitar style i was woken up one morning by two spanish guys singing shape of you followed by hotel california you couldnt get more tasteless
  agree with this i find this attitude retarded whenever i travel i rarely hang out with people from my own country doesnt make any sense to me
  i have never encountered a guitar guy yet but ive heard stories on how they always play the most basic bitch songs and all that     i have a band back home we tour a lot  im a musician i wrote this    those musicians can fuck off when they can barely go through a four bar song
  i hope i have the same experience as you coz i love meeting people from my home town southerners are cunts
   a bunch of people that are probably from your own country    look at this anon that has never been to a hostel
  im maltese so the chance i find a countryman in said hostel is close to fucking zero and if i do my accent is perfectly american and can bullshit myself through a conversation to make them think im a yank unless somethings gone terribly wrong and im terrible homesick happened only once before the last thing i want to do on vacation is mingle with my people we are loud obnoxious entitled and everytime were abroad they expect me to hang out with them like weve always been best friends and get offended when you want to do your own shit fuck off me man    i generally stay in private rooms at a hostel anyway because i like security and the possibility of banging a local
  the 19 year old who all the other 19 year olds think is brilliant because he is taking a gap year after doing his freshman gen ed requirements in neuropsychology  the dutch guy wont shut the fuck up about american politics  the long haired blonde guy who has only worn flip flops for two years  the aussie bogan who brings his own bottle to the bar and pisses off the staff  the entrepreneur  the group of israelis who only socialize among themselves and are the fucking worst when it comes to manners  the girl from california who cant stop bragging about how guys have paid for her to travel on their boats  the group of chinese who cut you in line at the airport  the european who still barely speaks english in 2018 in your hostel  the american who says hes from la when hes from a flyover state
  the dutch guy wont shut the fuck up about american politics  haha bang on
  id say europeans in general about american politics even a southern euro myself i see so many fucking snooty cunts talking shit about it especially hilarious coming from germans and belgians of all people their government system is like an eldritch maze
  i still havent met a single of these stereotypes do you people stay at party hostels or are you travelling to all the meme hotspots in europe/sea
  these are on five different continents some meme spots some not meme spots     have you really not met a guy traveling who claims hes an entrepreneur
  i dont know where i came off as judgemental  anecdotal but the majority of the older people i spoke with were aimless and not the kind i would find myself associating with ill take the company of a businessman staying at a high end chain rather than an esl lifer at a hostel  how about there you faggot
gonna be spending christmas and new years in hawaii first time in a hostel what should i expect
  truth hurts have fun teaching asian five year olds at 60 enjoy
  if i would meet you in an hostel id ask you to teach me recipes
  nah only freelancers of all sorts no one claimed to be an entrepeneur im not denying that those people exist but most people are pretty normal and agreeable even if some of the stuff they say makes me cringe
  i was planning on doing this but i decided on europe this year what island
 a group of rude israeli jews absolutely the worst people you will ever encounter   smelly middle aged indian dudes they rarely talk ever   a group of 20year old european girls who are taking a year off because they dont know shit about life or what they want to do fun to hang around with   group of drunk north european guys always either drunk or about to go drinking also fun to hang around with   eastern european weirdo into hard drugs crazy still fun
  you make me cringe so hard
  lmao u jealous of people who are sexually active
  its the virgin rage showing
  lol fuck so true wow anon im glad you are there noticing that too
  the specificity of the dutch person is essential
  oahu ive already been there before but it was just for a few days
  the american who wont shut up about merkel and muh refugees  its no different on the other side of the coin im german and thats literally every conversation i have with people 2 minutes in
  havnt stayed at a hostel there but i know on a boardwalk w walk down from waikiki beach is a good place to buy weed  t was harassed buy drug dealers there
    yeah its either all about blumpf orange man bad/merkle imposing shakira law
  this
  if she was hot you should have kept it
guy on a business trip for some reason staying at a hostel probably a divorcee  cunt with alarm that goes off 3 times at 5am before they wake up bonus points they havent packed their bags yet  dull as bricks young professional making it extremely obvious hes only there to pick up chicks and has a real hotel sidebooked  dude that checked in once and never left pretends to work for free board  chick that goes out of her way to tell everyone about her boyfriend but hooks up later that night  clingy unattractive girls waiting for someone to get drunk enough to bang them guaranteed to add you on fb and send you messages for the next 5 years
  i wish id meet one of those clingy girls
  wow perfect
  how do i keep my stuff safe in a hostel    i went to a serbian hostel once and it was full of immigrants and i didnt stay because i was afraid of them stealing my money passportetc
  clingy unattractive girls waiting for someone to get drunk enough to bang them guaranteed to add you on fb and send you messages for the next 5 years    legit happened several times for me please take a hint and stop messaging me
  have you tried the lockers
  not him but they might not have keys or lockers i hastily booked a hostel in krakow im staying in for two days next week but only noticed mediocre reviews after i booked wont allow me to get a refund so i have to stay      in which case check if your nearest train station has lockers or a luggage office you can stow your shit in thats what ill do if my hostel proves to feel unsafe
  if its just money and passport keep it on your person at all times and at night put them under your pillow
    the odds of that happening are 1/48627125
  show your work
  i say it was a 82 chance of happening   each person has a 1/365 chance of that day multiply by 3 you get 008219     0082 over 1 is 82
    better buy the lottery then unless i already used up my luck pulling that off
  that really cool random dude who you go to museums and bars with  the chill airbnb hostess who makes you a really good vegan meal even though you always though vegan food was shit  that guy who appreciates americans so you dont have to be ashamed to be yourself around him  that cute chick at the hostel who you run into while exploring the ancient greek ruins she seems really cool then she gets weird once her male friend comes back
  chick that goes out of her way to tell everyone about her boyfriend but hooks up later that night  met a costa rican chick in amsterdam who did that oh im so confused girl wasnt confused when we had sex that night
   the digital nomad
  i havent seen guitar man in a long time  ive become quite good and wanted to pick up the mantle but obviously i cant cart around an amp and im afraid my acoustic would get damaged lot of respect for those guys
  fuck the guitar play something better i dont travel with it but i play the oud and its usually some hate the sound a hit great instrument to play in the background and just fiddle around makes any situation feel intense lol really ancient sound i love it

what do you think about moscow in comparison to other european cities
    moscow had the least amount of npcs ive seen in europe outside of london and berlin
  moscow is a real crossroads city it has the modern amenities of western european cities while still dealing with its communist past and the benefits of a low cost labour force of migrants from the stans its a mix of east and west with a hint of that soviet/commie surrealism the metro system is great but all other modes of transport are mediocre at best and traffic is really bad you have a ton of restaurants that are much more expensive than the restaurants in my already costly canadian city while at the same time the locals can earn as little as around 150 a month and eat potatoes with mushrooms every day to survive yes this is true i was there with someone who had contacts so we talked to many locals dont get me wrong you have supermodels walking down the streets too or maybe theyre just average girls who are incredibly attractive and you have bentleys and sports cars going down the main streets a real crossroads    also has amazing nightlife if you have the cash it might be the best in the world for that actually
  bump
  i loved it moscow is really cool the area around the red square is beautiful
  berlin  least amount of npcs  really
i really didnt like moscow its hectic the pollution is bad and the metro is a real clusterfuck different stations with the same name if youre looking to visit there are surely great things to see and tverskaya st is great fun but living there is hell since youll be in the suburbs taking the metro two hours to your job and two hours back home    saint petersburg was much more pleasant and you could afford to live very well there on western money
  russia is a white african country i dont consider it europe its the capital of a mafia state a cold dubai no culture in other words i think its a shithole filled with trash people
do people still go to russia to get a wife or is that a thing of the past tfw no russian wife
  thing of the past you can still find a russian or eastern european wife but shell most likely be late 20s early 30s and have a child    they are usually high quality as they have an education and are more traditional but the best ones are picked up at a very young age by locals so youre left with the broken ones either mentally unstable physically ugly or single mothers
  can a guy from western europe still go to these countries and date and bring the high quality ones you are talking about where do you find them
  they can but you cant
  kekd hard
how many countries in your opinion are there in the world from a travellers perspective    i count 265 countries and territories to visit in order to claim ive visited every country in the world in my opinion these are    193 un nations  2 un observer states vatican city and palestine  9 disputed countries that arent un members kosovo taiwan sadr south ossetia abkhazia artsakh northern cyprus transnistria somaliland  1 continent antarctica where no country has sovereignty  3 british crown dependencies man guernsey jersey  15 british overseas territories  12 french overseas regions departments etc french guiana french polynesia etc  6 american overseas territories puerto rico guam etc  7 australian external territories ashmorecartier heardmcdonald norfolk lord howe christmas cocos/keeling and coral sea islands  3 new zealand territories the freely associated states of niue and cook islands as well as tokelau  4 chinese territories hong kong and macau sar paracel and spratly islands  2 danish constituent countries greenland and faroe islands  6 dutch constiuent countries and other territories aruba bonaire curaçao saba sint maarten sint eustatius  2 chilean overseas territories easter island and juan fernández    i count the usmoi and french southern lands as only one entry each not counting their individual islands i dont count the canary islands ceutamelilla the azores or madeira rather including them in spain and portugal i dont count the japanese outlying islands as separate either i also dont count rebel groups which control territory for practical reasons even though they fulfill certain critera for proto states because no one wants it as their goal to visit fucking isis or republic of donetsk    opinions somewhere you think should/shouldnt be on my list which ones do you count lets have a civil discussion guys the definiton of a country is bound to be arbitrary anyway
for the purpose of country counting i only go by the un list plus the generally accepted ones such as vatican palestine kosovo taiwan
  so if you havent been to the uk and visit anguilla in the caribbean you just count it as having been to the uk
  i would if i hadnt been to the uk but for example i have been to china hk macau but only count them as one
  yeah i kinda agree on hk and macau its just hard to treat it as one country since you actually cant visit them on a chinese visa if i had gone on holiday only to hong kong i probably would tell people i was in china but on my actual list of countries visited id only list hong kong
  i have been to china hk macau but only count them as one    i count them as two hk being separate
so going to some protruding heap of bird shit with a military base on it counts as a country but quebecroc or belgium or whatever count as one op is a faggot
you should also add autonomous areas with their own languages and cultures that are distinct from the main country    if you do this then youll have almost 1001000 extra nations    some examples  ukscotlandwalesengland  chinatibetguangxiinner mongoliaxinjiangningxiamacaohong kong  spaincataloniabasquearagongibraltar    you can do this for almost every nation thus the high number of real nations    then you also have microstates which are defacto independent islands that get defended by the claimants with weaponry that the state never took back        last but not least you could add all human habited place without government as a separate nation state this would add uncontacted tribal communities and other tribal communities within other countries and jungles but also things such as the international space station    allinall its impossible to visit every country in the world if you look at it like this i mean its physically impossible to do so within 1 single lifetime it would probably take you about 10 years to just visit them all let alone genuinely experience them
really it depends on if you assume country means nation state or if it means culturally distinct territory because a legitimized legal and bureaucratic framework doesnt always line up with a populations historical and cultural traditions just ask the basques and the kurds  either way the guys who make globes will always have work
    i would have elaborated in the op if it wasnt for the character limit like i said the definiton of country is completely arbitrary one example would be isis which a few years ago had a better claim at being called a country than many failed states that also happens to be un members such as the central african republic or somalia being a un member is also seen as a much bigger defining factor than it really is just look at palau and niue there are absolutely no difference between them both are independent states in free association with the us and new zealand respectively except that niue is not a un member yet palau is a given on any list of sovereign states while niue is an obscure little island few people have even heard of thats never referred to as an independent country even though it undeniably is one    in the end there is no clear definition of a country which is why i added from a travellers perspective what constitutes a country when you are on holiday not all countries have border controls the schengen area for schengen citizens their own currency ecuador and zimbabwe uses the us dollar for example you also have multicountry currencies like the euro and west african franc control of all their territory ukraine somalia many more et cetera ad infintum thats why i wanted to hear how travellers here count their countries    my definition is a combination of an international recognition enforced border and geographical isolation two examples south ossetia is different from georgia because you cant actually visit the former from the latter even though its supposedly the same country visiting the pitcairn islands is also infintely more difficult than hopping on a plane to london because of its isolation thats why i define those as being their own countries from a travellers perspective     1/2
i dont count culturally distinct areas because its impossible to actually define what culturally distinct is most villages all over the world will claim to be different from the neighbouring village just look at a map of europe in the 1800s its an absolute clusterfuck of city states that was different enough from their neighbours that they obviously deserved to be a country in its own right today theyre all happily part of germany if catalonia is a country then by what definiton their language culture and history is closely tied with that of the rest of spain and theres no border control a random tourist going from madrid to barcelona will hardly notice a difference is it because they want to be a country then that will open the door for literally thousands of areas where a couple of old men wants to be free and also meme micronations where some idiot claims their house is a country it also goes the other way is austria significantly different enough from germany to be called a country theres no border control they speak the same language and use the same currency this goes back to my previous post about international recognition    i also dont count uncontacted tribes such as north sentinel island even though they are effectively independent visiting these areas is next to impossible and would also be morally questionable as you would endanger an isolated tribes way of life and you could also bring with you some medieval disease that will wipe out half their population    finally i dont count areas that establish some sort of independence in the middle of a civil war such as isis or kurdistan only if these areas remain independent for a long time i would consider it which is my reasoning with somaliland they have had a functioning government currency flag and enforced border for 20 years and you cant visit from somalia proper    just my two cents theres no right answer i just want to hear peoples opinions
hey /trv/     doing the thailand thing will be in the north  south looking for wide range of experience not just a degenerate trip     where would you recommend checking out around bangkok phuket  southern islands    tldr  thai thread  post some best ofs
    koh lipe koh lanta krabi koh tao khao sok national park bkk chiang mai pai chiang rai    skip phuket phi phi samui full moon party bullshit
  really nothing good in phuket
not to hijack this thread but ive been working on my own itinerary for a 4 week visit to thailand    bangkok 7 nights with a few day trips to other places  sukhothai 4 nights  chiang mai 7 nights with a few day trips to other places  koh lanta 4 nights  khao sok 4 nights  bangkok 2 nights    what do you guys think of this    sukhothai is there because i know someone who lives there and can let me stay in their mansion for free
  bkk  what is this something in bangkok
    also can you two talk about what you would do in the places you listed
  actually a pretty decent itinerary good to see someone taking things slower as much as i love both bangkok and chiang mai i think 7 days each could be a bit long unless you had particular things in mind to do this is coming from someone who spent a whole month in chiang mai too as much as people talk shit on it i really enjoyed pai my first few trips there chiang rai is good too if you get a motorbike and explore the surrounding area ive also heard good things about chiang dao but i havent been there yet so i cant say more on that     if you have any specific questions about the places you listed then go ahead and ask otherwise i usually use a combination of travelfish wikitravel and tripadvisor to find the things i want to do
  yeah i personally dont really want to spend that long in the cities but my friend wants to spend most of the time in them im hoping to find some rad day trips for when we inevitably get sick of them      i like to experience different atmospheres and environments when i travel so i was going for places that were reasonably different from one another i wont go into the cities as theyre already well known and i dont really have a lot planned for specific activities but each spot has its things theyre famous for     koh lanta is a bit harder to reach than the popular islands so its a lot less crowded but its still developed enough to have restaurants and resorts ill probably hire a scooter to explore the island find fairly empty beaches and have a generally chill time    khao sok is a massive jungle with a giant lake / river there is a ton of environmental tourist stuff there from bathing elephants to exploring caves    sukhothai has a lot of old temples and ruins centuries ago it was the capital of siam and they have a signature noodle dish which is supposed to be amazing
  good choice on ko lanta just be careful where you stay though the northern beaches are pretty shit and crowded so the further south you go generally the less people im a fan of klong nin and relax bay the whole island is fantastic for scooter exploring especially the national park at the southern end of the island
stupid question but is it appropriate to travel to thailand carrying one of these    it would be my first time in a kinda third world country
  of course youll be fine those even work in shithole countries in africa we flashpacked through vietnam with those boyos  my friends with large backpacks were nonironically jealous after a week
  cool thanks
how much in general would you bring for spending money    im thinking about 300quid but i aint sure on really how expensive things are desu like food etc
i wanted to go to thailand but not ever since that thread about stds
going to do 4 nights bankok then 10 nights phuket doing varies day trips to phi phi island jammes bond island krabi etc looking to relax and not do a lot in phuket too as it is more of a holiday from work
going to thailand in december for 2 weeks by myself    was thinking about splitting my time to 34 days in bangkok phuket and chiang mai each is this enough time or should i spend a week in 2 of those instead also open to suggestions for different places    would you guys recommend staying in hotels or airbnb im looking to hook up with non whore thai girls over there so im not sure on the guest rules
  300 bucks what the fuck
how bad are the mosquitoes in thailand  laos am i going to get bitten to fuck in the evenings or near water or is insect repellent enough to stop it    how about wild animals i was too cheap to pay for the rabies jab
  koh tao  dies
  airbnb is a gamble on what would be condemned in a 1st world country but dude spend 1 week in cities and 1 week on a moderately quiet island trust me youll enjoy the fresh air being able to drive a scooter etc
  im from north east usa and the skeeters there are worse than thailand but yeah bug spray is fine but buy a small one at home and bring it with
  id probably just do bangkok and chiang mai unless youre really a beach person and can make the most of it    phuket itself is pretty unimpressive compared to phang nga bay and the islands    i personally stay in hotels airbnb is technically illegal for short stays and hotels are so cheap    ive never had a problem bringing a girl back to a hotel sometimes they check their id but not always just be discrete and dont bring someone who looks dodgy for that hotel    saying that some nice nonwhores dont like going back with tourists because people will assume theyre a whores
  thanks anon i have some so should be set
going to bangkok and then udon thani next week to visit my distance girlfriend    she wants me to eat this dish made of raw beef and im afraid because i read about people getting parasites from it    she said they only eat it at special events like when visitors come
  pretty hard to give you advice for a whole freaking country it obviously depends on the region
  some nice nonwhores dont like going back with tourists because people will assume theyre a whores  true i always check them in so they do not lose their face to the people working at reception most insist to be escort ed out of the hotel in the morning though which is onviously a pain in the ass but oh well what can you do might as well get some breakfast then
best website for booking hotels in thailand please
  its either agoda or booking best advice is to book your hotel for one or two nights in advance and then just get them deals while you are in thailand
  the other week i had to go downstairs in the morning and meet a motorcycle taxi guy who was bringing the chick her work clothes that her housemate had sent over she was a nice office girl from a rich family    i find tinder in bangkok to be amazing i usually just meet them for a coffee then see them again that evening or later in the week     a number of times theyve tested me by saying theyre a prostitute fortunately the first time this happened i had a number of chicks linedup for dates so said i wasnt interested turns out she just wanted to know if i was the type of guy i am as well but only from timetotime i dont go there just to fuck
is it worth to go to chiang mai for 3 days i have a spare 4 days before starting a touring from bkk down to kl  i would like to check out some jungle and temples before crossing the messy and trap infested phuket and the south  also considering returning from chiang mai to bkk by night train anyone done it
  haaahhhahahahahaahaaah
dont skip ayutthaya if youre at all interested in the countrys history great city to walk around
is it difficult to ride a motorbike in pai     im planning on renting one there and riding really slowly since im not used to ride bikes
  what was mentioned beyond stds and prostitutes
  300 is about 7500
  easy as fuck the drive from pai  mae hong son is really nice too but curvy
stupid question but which is the official website to buy train tickets i want to buy a train ticket from bangkok to chiang mai
  its ok i just bought it on 12go asia
hey guys im going to thailand for 8 days over ny and i was initially single when i booked these flights but since got a partner and shes going to be accompanying me i was planning to spend 4 days in bangkok and 4 in pattaya but i realise that pattaya probably isnt the best place to bring your gf so i was throwing up between chiang mai or phuket as a second destination what would you recommend  cheers
  curveball go to isan  its off the beaten path for tourists so you could have a more unique experience
  cheers will do some research
does grab works fine    im planning on using it in bangkok and chiang mai and to get to the airport in both cities if i book it in advance do they normally show up in time
  thailands visa rules say you have to have at least 20000 baht or equivalent roughly us610 gbp470 when you enter the country otherwise they dont have to let you in earlier in the year they were cracking down on it mostly at land crossings for people who were obviously doing visa runs to extend their stays then some shit happened with chinese tourists getting pissed off and thailand started hurting for tourist revenue so they might or might not still be doing random checks on arrival    yes its stupid its thailand what did you expect no it doesnt matter how long your planned stay is presumably they think you can magically get more if youre hanging around for six months    note this may not be applicable if you bothered to get a genuine tourist visa instead of relying on visaexempt entry or visaonarrival i dont know i wouldnt count on that though    if you have a credit card as well as that ready cash you would probably be ok but it really depends on the individual customs asshole      who the hell cares about thai history oh some shitty godking was a giant douchebag riding herd on a bunch of ignorant peasants wow amazing oh thais always wore western clothing and used forks and knives and spoons just like civilized people you mean they skipped that whole chopsticks thing and never went around barebreasted like the really old photos show you dont say oh thailand was never colonized which is why its called thailand which means free land i guess we can ignore that whole japanese thing in ww2 then oh you just mean europeon powers ok
  it would be my first time in a third world country
  they usually just take 10 min since theyre already around
    ok yeah we need to stop saying third world   its a relic of the cold war   first world  nato and allies  second world  warsaw bloc and allies  third world  unaligned    from wikipedia  it is considered a regional power in southeast asia and a middle power in global affairs with a high level of human development the second largest economy in southeast asia and the 20th largest by ppp thailand is classified as a newly industrialized economy    so a better way to categorize thailand is putting it in together with china and mexico
  removing the kinda from the quote
  textbook definition / what it means to most
how to get cheaply from thailand to hong kong all flights i see are around 200
  depends on your partner    if you want an active time with lots of exploring go to chiang mai if you want to chill at the beach and do boat trips go to phuket    both areas are going to be busy over that period picking a good hotel in phuket is essential whereas in chiang mai its less important    i would probably only do 2 or 3 days in bangkok at the end of the trip and have an extra day elsewhere simply because some of that time will be travelling    another option for beach life is hua hin/cha am which is close to bangkok to the extent that taxis will take you there like pattaya but much nicer there are still bars and some of that stuff but its side action rather than the action the beaches certainly arent exceptional but there are some nice national parks and other sights within easy reach
hey    what happened to the fake markets in khao san road are they all gone now i wanted to buy a fake university diploma there

  go to the medical museum worth a look  scooter or train and river boat ride about 40 mins from soi nanna   chatuchak weekend markets around the same time away from town huge markets cheap    climb ghost tower interesting building near train and river boat terminal on way to medical museum went bust building it just after the final levels got poured in 97 was full of dog and gangs for a while on the lower levels police have tried to sort it out and welded it closed   full of graffiti and ruins of a 60 story hotel    also if u like that kinda shit  this may be gone now tho    the unfinished shopping mall that the underground carpark levels have filled with water over years and locals have filled with koi fish to get rid of some of the mosquitoes breeding in there pretty crazy never saw that myself but seen on many travelers videos said to have been pumped out i think in 2016 but i dont think they did much more than that so hopefully its come back to its old self again    will look into it again before my next trip     anyone been and seen the mall
  med museum is fucking freaky
  never heard of it but you could get something made up im sure
  fake markets in khao san road  just read an article about it says theyre still available driver licence tefl cert uni degrees
  still there just discrete nowadays
  how angry are you you fucktard  im plenty interested in thai history  ayuttaya and sukhothai are great history cities  stay in mummas basement you cunt  also never got checked for funds ever in my six times of going there
  why would you do that just print one out yourself itll serve the same purpose since nobody will believe it either way     but i mean youre stupid enough to go out of your way to pay for a fake piece of paper youre stupid enough to think itll be useful
  me either never had any checks at borders with 
any good whorehouse close to chiang mai airport     ill be in the area on a saturday night and was thinking of getting my dick sucked before i fly out next morning    or maybe ill try tinder
are there many free wifi places dotted around bkk was thinking about buying a cheap unlocked phone and getting a thai sim
  they only check if you look like a poor
  just buy a data plan its super cheap for 7 days with unlimited 4g
what are some fun things to do on nye in bangkok
  the city is close to the airport so just go there
  nye isnt really that big of a deal compared to most busy nights in bangkok the beach resorts are better for nye in my opinion    there are some parties especially at rooftop bars i generally avoid places that are ticketed events as theyre usually underwhelming vs a normal night there    i tend to either head to a jazz bar or just some bars that are popular with students
2 questions anons 1 my flight time got changed so i have a 1 hour 50 minute transfer in pudong both flights china eastern how fucked am i 2 my flight gets in at about 1am and my hotel is in pattaya with a 3pm checkin later that day can i store my shit somewhere and explore for the night recommendations or should i just stay in the airport to take the bus in the morning
quick question dont want to hijack the thread i am off to bangkok for a few days with the girlfriend are there any bars/areas that we can get a bit of the atmosphere of ladyboys sex workers etc but is a bit more toned down/tourist friendly dont want to bang a prostitute or go anywhere grim
will be in bangkok tomorrow anything worth checking out christmas decorations local shows only staying a few days
  i brought one too its fine
  koh chang was the best place i went on my trip perfect if you just want sublime comfy beaches and a fun road to motorbike around that winds up and down hills and monkeys
    this go to pattaya for nye its a cheap quick bus ride they run the buses all night long so people can go back to bangkok or wherever    the whole fucking beach has fireworks shows the biggest hotels all try to outdo each other its the best ive ever seen      just go to soi cowboy or soi nana id say cowboy since they actually dance there at nana they all just stand on a stage and sway until someone picks them out to take out and fuck patpong is much sleazier and has a lot more tourist scams and strongarmextortion      its not polite to call them that anon
    thank you

  gbp to usd
  n o way it that amount 300 quid is more like 400usd
  getting ripped off on your travel money this hard
as an american what is the best way i can learn to speak and read thai
  find a local to serve as your travel partner
  i mean as an american currently in america who doesnt want to travel to thailand until i learn some of the language
  internet youtube can help a bit  your not going to learn it well enough for it to make a difference to your trip unless you go there and actually listen to them speak even then they speak so fucking quick its hard to pick up on which tone they are using for each word and weather that was actually a long vowel or are they just exaggerating what they are saying after all that it can be hard to figure out which dialect they might even be speakingsouthern pasa thai isaan  hello and thank you will get you through just fine  they mostly speak good broken english at least enough you wont have any problems
  best advice is to book your hotel for one or two nights in advance and then just get them deals while you are in thailand    sorry for being dense what do you mean exactly are you suggesting to only book for the first couple of nights there then fly by the seat of your pants from there
  where are the best beaches in thailand

việt nam gễnẻrậl taxi driver showdown edition    what are the things you are enjoying about vietnam post the things that piss you off about it share advice or questions if you are thinking about coming to vietnam share cool hidden places or things that happened that you found in this country
  do not use google maps to look up bus routes
  if you have android hanoibusmaps is decent and free only for hanoi otherwise buses are usually anywhere between a nightmare and luxury travel
the most beautiful part of the country is north of hanoi where almost nobody goes except for sapa
  its almost always a nightmare for me the traffic is often horrible too  though tourists probably wont suffer this  also i dont think thats the official app but the last time i tried the official one it didnt even work
how much would the bribe be if i was caught smashed out of my mind and had heroin on me would they even check me for drugs 20 bucks seems like it should way do it but ive heard of assholes paying 5001200 fucking bucks for getting caught with drugs can someone whos in the know shed some light on the situation
  vietnam isnt as bribe friendly as neighbouring countries  500 would be cheap  id put a few thousand on it and hope a lone cop catches you instead of a group
  well i guess to cambodia it is then kinda disappointing ive heard there bribes are much cheaper can you or anyone confirm this
  you have to understand theres no standard specification sheet the police of countries pass around  literally goes  cop busts you  looks you up and down  assesses your worth   thinks what he needs in life  comes back demands 3000 usd  its completely arbitrary   like the other guy said ive found it ms cheaper and quicker if youre busted by a single cop when youre taken down the station everyone wants in and you waste a lot of time  my uncle spent 3 days in jail for smoking in a jeepney once because he refused to bribe the entire station they only let him go in the end because he was refusing food and water well so he said he never has any money and is useless and probably sucked their cocks to go free  point is negotiate quickly pay the bribe gtfo before a cop remembers his daughter needs a laptop
i am planning to do a 3 weeks trip in vietnam so far the plan is to go from hanoi to saigon by the coast any good advice where to stay in hanoi and saigon any good towns by the coast that wouldnt have too many russian tourists
  cambodia seemed a bit looser with that kinda stuff but i only went to siem reap but heard from others its the same in phphen mushies and weed was around and visible but not sure on h and the laws in the mountains wheres its produced u may have a easy time but as well the drug armies are up that way possibly depending on the time of year
  bro do not go to nha trang i call it little russia
  from memory nha trangs street signs have russian on them too
viet nam comes from chinese yue nan which is derived from the chinese kingdom of nanyue  it literally means south yue  yue was a chinese term for the nonchinese people living south of the red river 2 millenniums ago  modern archeological evidence prove that yues were almost exclusively kradai people and not austroasiatickinh or generally viet    are viets the greatest larpers of asia
  vietnam isnt as bribe friendly as neighbouring countries  kek with the exception of cambodia which is almost pathetically easy the ease of bribing is almost the same
  do not go to nha trang i call it little russia  meh it has good scuba diving and you dont have to hang out with russians if you dont want to  otherwise youre correct business in town is definitely centred on russians  its because the airport is russianleased because its an old russian airbase but is now 50 commercial but only for russian airlines this means that russians have direct flights into vietnam there and can go do some diving beach stuff and tours without having to fuck around with buses etc
  if i was caught smashed out of my mind and had heroin on me  then youre in serious trouble and the bribe is going to be large    20 bucks seems like  that wouldnt even cover minor traffic offenses like riding a motorcycle without a helmet or a lefthand turn against a hidden sign saying no lefthand turns those were usd25100 when i was there could be more now      siem reap  mushies and weed  yeah its common enough there but generally sold and consumed on premises as things on pizza whatever youre probably ok in a bar/cafe consuming their edibles but if you walked around with it then youre an atm and some cop might feel like making a withdrawal theyre probably discouraged from doing so in siam reap but i wouldnt count on it      are viets the greatest larpers of asia  they fought a very great many wars about this so theyre certainly committed larpers  i think its understood that north vietnamese are a distinct ethnic group from south vietnamese they certainly have enough linguistic differences
  most of southeast asia has fought wars m8 just like medieval europe   it wasnt until the whte man came with superior tactics that they all got absolutely rekt
  but i like russians
  inb4 the vietnam war was a tie  idiot
  most of southeast asia has fought wars m8 just like medieval europe  large parts of it were stable for large periods vietnam has been trying to assert independence since 100bce and theyve only had about 300 years of actual independence since then
where in vietnam could i find a cyberpunk aesthetic  im talking about  high tech  neon signs  lots of rain  drugs and prstitutes  skyscrapers  communist shit
  worlds largest war power against a bunch of farmers oh geez i wonder how thats gonna end
so comfy bros
  as a general rule i wouldnt recommend having anything to do with serious drugs in asia    in the west drug crimes are just jail rehab or whatever depending on the crime and country here it can be mandatory death penalty
literally just touched down in hanoi waiting for my visa    mad excited
  i really liked dalat  check out the mazebar
  you doing it wrong dont just go by the coast go inland vietnam head to phong nha via ninh binh and then head south on the ho chi minh highway westtheres two it is seriously the best road take it all the way to khe sanh then head to the coast hue da nang hoi an ect this guide is going the opposite way but explains it better  vietnamcoracle com /hochiminhroadthebestbits/
  have you eaten a bowl of pho or had a banh mi thit yet anon      cheers will do man da lat is really nice and a lot different from hcmc i especially prefer the cooler climate
  ask a taxi driver to take you to a thit cho restaurant its unironically delicious
just booked a ticket to ho chi minh where i plan to stay for 23 weeks in december what are the cool spots to drink what about busy places where i can sit and drink and watch people walk by any cities a few hours drive away worth visiting
to me vietnam looks like it would be very inflexible with language barriers i feel that english would be very limited there    how wrong am i besides vietnamese and at least some english in tourist areas what else do they speak
  bringing canadian cigarettes into vietnam  i couldve sworn someone said vietnam had some of the best tobacco in asia
  how wrong am i besides vietnamese and at least some english in tourist areas what else do they speak  its mostly only people who deal with tourists who can speak english    theres some russian spoken in a few areas and by professionals of a certain age because they studied engineering in russia usually    around ha long bay and maybe sapa youll get a fair bit of mandarin spoke too thats probably true for all the border regions and the languages on the other side of the border
  the language barrier has personally been my primary source of frustration    been in hanoi for 2 months now and contemplating moving to hcm  thoughts
  i take it all those backpackers generally stay in expat areas or they do a lot of pointing and hand gestures when theyre in vietnam sorry about the stupid questions i just dont know how people travel when theres a language barrier actively working against them
just learn vietnamese lol
tips on vietnam to get the real experience u should really learn vietnamese the tourist areas obviously have people who speak english but to be honest traveling to just see a bunch of temples and nice views is pretty boring ull just be another cockhead tourist the real experience comes with talking to the locals which foreigners do not do nor want to unless shes a cute viet girl know the prices of stuff it isnt hard figuring out the conversion between dong and dollar if your paying 5 bucks for a beer ur fucking up the only thing expensive in vietnam is private hotel room and buying meat from the market everything else u should be paying dirt cheap prices dont take rides from random guys who offer u motorbike ride they will take all ur money use grab dont be a fucking cockhead tourist and try to push all ur dumbass beliefs onto other foreigners ok the viet love foreigners so no matter what u do they like u but dont be an ass with other foreigners fucking way too many hippies in asia trying to push their vegan buddhist and peace beliefs into me ok ur not a buddhist pls stop
  hey good eye man those are my canadian uncles cigarettes since he only smokes jps for some reason  probably used to it i suppose    you are correct though the amount of variety in cigarettes in vietnam as well as the general pricing of them is great  the locals seem to love either the 555 brand or jet the latter being way too heavy for me though they seem to be able to smoke a bunch of them no problem
  i take it all those backpackers generally stay in expat areas or they do a lot of pointing and hand gestures when theyre in vietnam  backpackers probably stick to tourist areas not expat areas and yeah lots of pointing and using the ten words they learn probably also a fair bit of smartphone translating      i just dont know how people travel when theres a language barrier actively working against them  asa above just learn a bit the language barrier will make life complicated for complex things but simple things work well enough there arent many barriers when it comes to finding accommodation food and transport bus ticket sellers only need the name of the place you want to go to and they can sell you a ticket if you look at it and its not the ticket you want you shake your head before smartphones we used pocket phrase books or made do without      dont take rides from random guys who offer u motorbike ride they will take all ur money  i did that once he just wanted to suck my cock
anyone know where i can get some bud    living in hanoi
  i did that once he just wanted to suck my cock  yea a white guy in vietnam is not only attractive to women but the gay men will definitely try to pick u up i had guys grab my cock before on the bike    anyone know where i can get some bud  dont do any drugs in vietnam dont be that fucking western clown sure its easy to get drugs and the police have a hard time controlling the drugs but vietnam is essentially a commmunist country they are harsh on the law and if u get caught they will fuck u up they executed a banker recently because he commited fraud
  yea a white guy in vietnam is not only attractive to women but the gay men will definitely try to pick u up i had guys grab my cock before on the bike  come to think of it i also met a beach boi in danang that wanted to suck my cock and steal some cash from my pocket  i feel like he kind of earned that 20k dong or whatever it was      drugs in asia  youre a moron  that said theres a path to fairly safe dealings if you dont mind spending some cash  hanoi still has the bar curfew right  go hang out at a bar north of the lake you probably know the little street with a few decent bars that cater to foreigners as well as locals hook up with some other expats when the curfew rolls around ask them which bars go late theres a few speakeasy places where they post lookouts and tell everyone to shut up when the cops roll past  those bars will probably deal joints ive certainly been sitting in one when the bartender a stunningly hot viet chick sat at the bar rolling js and selling them like drinks  if she can sell js she can probably sell weed as well though it will be marked up since shes not strictly a dealer  id imagine that most of those speakeasies could do that too and they probably dont want the heat that would come with setting up a foreigner if theyre getting their cut then theyre probably on the level as much as any dealer could be
flying into hanoi tomorrow if anyone wants to meetup
phong nha and trang an in ninh binh are the most beautiful places ive ever visited 10/10 would return push yourself and take a challenging cave/jungle trek in phong nha and youre settled its fucking magic inside those caves
    i bought some weed the other night    just be out the front of a bar at like 2am and some guy will come up to you    now i just got the problem with smoking it cause the hostel doesnt allow it and it would be stupid to do so on the street
  hostel  theres your problem live like a child get treated like one do you stay in a bunkbed with siblings at home
  random people approaching you at 2am offering to sell drugs    how likely is it that theyre undercover cops/dealers working with the local police
  stay the fuck away from mui ne its basically a beach with russian tourists    dalat is essential its basically a french mountain village with much cooler weather canyoning etc my favourite place there    hoi an is fine but its basically a town of girls in elephant pants taking selfies
  1 for da lat very pretty and very cool climatewise lovely place
  hoi an is fine but its basically a town of girls in elephant pants taking selfies  theres a lot of truth to that but you can get some very nice clothes there
  this hand tailored suits
  how does the quality/pricing differ from say hong kong or india
  rastaman at west lake sells weed but its 300k for a bag
  hoi an/hue were the biggest letdowns for me during my hcmchanoi trip absolutely ruined by mass tourism couldnt go anywhere without being harassed by dudes on motorbikes and the endless chads and thots on holiday further ruin the experience
where do you guys get notshit weed in hcmc is the hammock lady still there
  how does the quality/pricing differ from say hong kong or india  cheaper than hong kong no idea about india but probably  quality is hitmiss though many of the more central places just chew through tourist orders like fresh meat and hand over substandard shit knowing that your tour bus is leaving and you cant do shit about it    if you stick around for several days and go to one of the edgeoftown places and get personal attention theyll take it more seriously and you can get good stuff it helps to buy a shirt first and review it before deciding whether to get anything bigger from that store but it all takes time since most stuff is nextday  i bought shirts different kinds long and short sleeve some asian style from six places and then made decisions based on that half the buttons fell off the shirts many had single stitch seams that would have easily come apart stuff like that      hoi an/hue  couldnt go anywhere without being harassed by dudes on motorbikes  this is certainly true in hoi an at least in the stretch between the hotels and the old town you cant walk 10m without some asshole calling out back to hotel and them pulling up right in front of you when you try to cross the road and blocking your path so you have to go around them    in hue at night the area around the foreign hostels/bars/restaurants is full of the same sorts of guys but theyre mostly selling drugs and girls you still have to go around them every time you want to cross the road because the instant you pause at the side of the road they pull up right in front of them    chads and thots  didnt see much of that seemed to be more backpackers than anything else all seemed pretty reasonable to me but maybe it depends on when you go whether its during australian summer break or something
  wouldnt be easier to bring some fron cambodia
  you cant walk 10m without some asshole calling out back to hotel and them pulling up right in front of you  whats their endgame whitey gets mad and a dozen viet guys come out of nowhere to kick his ass i cant imagine that they are sincerely acting as a volunteer pedestrian inconveniencer task force
shit im stupid i thought you meant 10m from the hotel and they were telling you to go back there
  meet local friends i met two dudes from saigon in hanoi that were smoking stuff on par with the us serious chronic shit and they would have it shipped to them wherever they were traveling
  theyre trying to drum up business they want to drive you back to your hotel for a few bucks and ideally rip you off by tripling the price theyre competing with dozens of other guys so they all want to be 10m closer to where you started than the other guys so its now at the point where by the time youve walked around the corner from the hotel district literally still in stones throw youre being harangued and followed by them  as soon as you stand still for 20 seconds one will pull up in front of you to try and get your money before anyone else    ive pushed a couple of them around when ive had enough which takes a while because im on holiday but in the vietnamese afternoon heat and being shouted at all day it happens eventually nothing happened they got pissed maybe rode off or just stared at me wondering what happened or shouted a bit they never fought back some kept trying to sell me rides/drugs youre not a real person to them just a customer to get money from and the words theyre saying arent actual conversationnone of them speak good enough english for that theyre just stock phrases that they hope will unlock cash like a crackbot bruteforcing passwords from a list    hoi an has dedicated tourist police so its probably a bad idea for touts to get their attention hue police probably dont want scumbags getting into fights with tourists either in hoi an the tourist police keep the touts etc in line within the old town area theres a designated region that theyre not allowed inside of
  i did that once he just wanted to suck my cock  after i returned my motorbike i was pretty transportless in hcmc so i got on one of these guys bikes he took me around the city and then to a whore house but yeah he took a shitload of my money very dumb
its a beautiful place
  are you a cute girl
planning to go in either march or late april i have a work commitment in the first half of april    if i want to spend 23 weeks there should i go to the north south or central regions maybe i should do north/ central central/ south or some variation    i live in a hot humid area in australia so id prefer a cooler drier climate also ive grown up in a beach town so beaches arent very exciting for me when travelling id much prefer hiking/ mountains etc im guessing the north is better for this
  are you me came to ask as well also ausfag
    haha i live on the gold coast and work outdoors in the summer hanging out at beaches and sweating during the day id the last thing i want to do on a holiday
  cooler drier climate  nowhere in vietnam is actually dry but you can get cool at least by heading to the mountains that tends to be kind of cold and damp definitely foggy and damp most of the year but the cool is refreshing after the rest of vietnam    hiking/ mountains  you want sapa if you can either bring a folding bike or something or hire a scooter when you get there though that could get pricey for a few weeks you could get around without it by hiking between villages and there are sometimes trails youre somewhat at the mercy of daylight though and it would take you half the day to get anywhere but it would be hiking through mountain jungle so the hike might be worth it on its own  every village will have places you can get something to eat but half the time its just going to be a bowl of instant noodles and a fried egg or something once you get out of the main township theres very little support for tourists but not quite zero and if you have some cash someone will make do because the region is quite poor and cashcomfort  it would be fun to do without speaking any vietnamese but you could manage my vietnamese is pretty shit and i could generally get by with a few words and some sign language an offline translation suite for your phone is probably useful but i wouldnt rely on having charge if i went hiking around the mountains for a few days    there are rudimentary hiking trails to various waterfalls and villages you wouldnt be the first white man to walk there but its definitely not a mainstream thing either there are stories about the main township being a sex tourism location with underaged hmong village girls but i never actually saw any evidence of it and i bet it would drop to zero when you walked out of the town anyway    
what are the really touristy areas of vietnam  on the one hand id like to look up things that get a lot of attention on the other id like to avoid being surrounded by foreigners when i visit another country all about weighing up the pros and cons
      or just use google translate
do people try seeling shit to tourists around hanoi been to bali and phuket before and couldnt walk down the street without people approaching me trying to sell me something
  your going to vietnam ur prob a white person everyone is dark skinned asian theyre gonna stare at you a lot their gonna bother u cause ur rich in their eyes and most foreigners dont care about dropping big bills in vietnam     like i said to the previous guy these countries r poor many of the people make a living selling shit to dumbo foreigners like u u could go out of the tourist area but less people r gonna speak english and more people r just gonna stare at u
  this doesnt happen as much as white guys on /trv think youll be fine
be me  excited for hcm  told its a very developed city with lots of commerce and parks  takes taxi first day to the south along the river during the first day   entire riverbank is covered in shanties  eventually start to notice the terrible state of the roads that diverts from the main ones swallowed sidewalks trash low building quality and poor zoning law enforcement of buildings beyond the facades sewage stench in certain areas graffiti littering and terrible driver obedience  its just like any other southeast asian shithole    jk of course its not a problem it just caught me by surprise as i was told it was very developed like chinese cities is it like this in pretty much any city there
  its definitely not as developed as an equivalent chinese city it is just developed enough to be comfy for a foreigner
tfw going on a trip there cause family are bringing me along  dont particularly feel strongly about vietnam but we are going to saigon and hoi an any nice spots for a photographer or interesting history
go to hanoi they said  constantly scammed always charged at higher rate than usual  all taxi drivers are extremely rude and yelling  vendors wont leave me alone  lots of food is very dirty served on dirty plates  city is generally uninteresting  actually saw someone poo in roo near the river bank  painful bruise from a retard on scooter driving past me with some planks on the back didnt even stop to apologize and ask if i was fine  why did i fall for the saigon is more dangerous meme from all ive read its a much better city in every single way  i regret every single day here and has otherwise ruined my travel mood _
i dont understand why foreigners think vietnam is gonna treat u like korea or japan vietnam is actually well developed for a country that had known nothing but war for decades the people will bother u of course they will cause ur a foreigners 95 percent of tourists are white and when ur white and tall in an all yellow skin short asian country they gonna harass u dont trust any random guy on the street know the vietnamese prices 22 viet dong is about 1 usd if ur paying 100 viet dong for a sandwhich ur obv paying too much vietnam can be fun but for those who dont know vietnamese or the country then ur gonna be spending a lot of money because ur limited to the areas and companies that wont scam u however u will be paying higher because youre in tourist area is everyone in this thread inexperienced about vietnam and i dont mean traveling to vietnam a few times i mean speaking vietnamese knowing the prices the cities the people and culture
  the viet ethnic group also has a large chunk of genetics from han chinese men who settled in the region and married local women along with chams and khmers that were forced to assimilate when vietnam swallowed up their territory
  the vietnamese themselves are mostly descended from kradai peoples but theres a lot of debate as to how they ended up speaking an austroasiatic language instead the name yue/việt originally referred to the kradai peoples but maybe a migration from the south of the red river delta of austroasiatic speakers caused a language shift       i think its understood that north vietnamese are a distinct ethnic group from south vietnamese they certainly have enough linguistic differences  south vietnam wasnt vietnamese territory until relatively recently but theyre still considered vietnamese they just have a lot of cultural genetic linguistic differences from the absorption of other sea people
  war museum is saigon is definitely worth visiting
  generally its thought that they were kradai speaking but then shifted towards a chinese dialect known as annam chinese when chinese men settled in the area and then they switched over to an austroasiatic language which was a creole of annam chinese which had a kradai substrate with protovietmuong but theres still a lot of debate between linguists
anyone have experience doing a trekking tour in sapa  how was the experience im thinking of doing a 23 day guided trek during my stay all the videos ive seen of sapa look amazing
what are the easiest ways to get between angkor wat and ho chi minh city
  anyone have experience doing a trekking tour in sapa  i went solo hooked up with a taiwanese girl i met on the bus and we hiked a bit around there also hired a scooter and rode around to some of the villages  it was very cool lovely scenery obviously
  hoi an  lots of things to photograph there dont forget the other side of the river from the old town    you can also get over to the vietnamese version of angkor wat from hoi an its a day trip away i think its basically a jungle trek past some bombed out ruins because some vc took cover in it and the usaf carpet bombed it so theres not much left but a few structures remain in various states and anyway the jungle trek is nice when they say to stay on the path because of landmines you should probably listen to them
  what are the easiest ways to get between angkor wat and ho chi minh city  easiest fly from siam reap to saigon airport  125 hours about 150    most backpacker 2 buses  overnight bus from siam reap to pp grab a happy pizza and a bottle of whiskey for the trip share with the fellow backpackers who will probably be the only people on the bus anyway  at pp grab another early early bus and head for saigon  entire trip is about 15 hours or so you leave siam reap early evening and arrive saigon midmorning i got a snack at about 4am in pp and had sticky rice for breakfast that i bought on a ferry over the mekong  getting the second bus to saigon is interesting but the first one drops you in a bus station in pp so you just need to wake someone up to tell you where to get the next one and youre good there are several buses so its more whether you want to wait for the later one when people are awake or try and find an early one on your own theres enough time to go for a walk and see some nearby sights
  ho chi minh is cool but why would you stay in just one city for 23 weeks you can see pretty much the whole country and have a great time in 3 weeks
  ancestry isnt defined by spoken language and this is why people who treat language families like kradai as ethnic groups are retarded
  because thats stupid ud be staying in a city for one day and sitting on the bus for the bext 6 to 9 hours to next location ud just be looking at temples that all pretty much look the same if he stays in hcm then he has a base of operations and can rent a bike to see the outlying area and come back to hcm
    i could probably spend three weeks in hcmc visiting all the outlying areas when i go to hoi an i try to go for about a week so that i have time to get stuff properly fixed when its not right the first time which it never is  and theres enough to do just wandering around
  actually saw someone poo in roo near the river bank  i literally imagined someone defecating into a kangaroos pouch and i laughed way harder than i should have
  going there during late december for 5 days with family where would be good to go thinking about hanoi  ha long bay would i have enough time to check out hue would it be worth it or are there some other good northern vietnam spots worth checking
  thit cho  thit cho  doggo
  what are the really touristy areas of vietnam  da nang and ba na hills is a tourist trap dont go to ba na hills unless you like fake european style buildings and taking selfies     that said da nang does have nice beaches depending on the hours you go its not even crowded
i heard hanoi people are actually very tribal and hates the rest of the country is this true
    ignoring hoi an ha long and nha trang
  its where the most powerful families are but i wouldnt necessarily say that everyone feels that way  it has a sort of claim to being the source of the revolution that built the country it was the first city liberated by the revolutionary army anyway and uncle ho established the modern state there and was mostly based there afterwards    people who arent part of the party/government probably dont care much though
  i can only talk about places ive been to anon
how long should i spend for a north to south trip of course longer is always better but in realistic terms  for context this year i saw seoul beijing shanghai tokyo kyoto and osaka in 3 weeks of course id have loved more time but i found that the pace was fine didnt feel rushed at all  would hanoi/sapa/hue/hoi an/hmc be realistic in 3 weeks
flying into saigon and hanging out in the city then around the mekong delta before travelling north    the main destinations will include da lat da nang phong nha hanoi sa pa    i have 3 1/2 weeks for this trip anybody know a good guide on the best ways to transit between each stop eg i may want to go from saigon to dalat by train then fly to danang etc    i dont mind catching trains but im reading everywhere that the buses can be really shit especially for taller people
i love the propaganda
i was originally thinking of skipping hoi an because i have no interest in lazing around on beaches how is the nightlife there though if its good i might spend a night or two there
on average what have you guys spent on hostels    did you book in advance or just arrive at a place and look for somewhere to stay
  how is the nightlife there though  practically nonexistent beaches exist but the town is really about tailoring
for those of you who have been how much did you spend a day what kind of traveling were you doing ie slumming it or living it up
  i traveled from saigon to hanoi and currently live in hanoi you can get a private room pretty much anywhere for around 10 a night food can cost anywhere from 80 cents to 10 dollars depending on your budget a normal local meal will cost around 23 dollars you can easily live off 20 a day with 30 a day you can have a private room and eat well
  the fuck are you talking about  the only people selling shit ia the occasional old lady selling lottery tickets to locals or in the extremely touristy area there might be a guy selling ciggarettes and sunglasses but thats about it
gf and i are going to hanoi for 3 weeks id like to do a few treks i had this idea of doing a multiday trek through sapa stopping through some villages does anyone know how i would go about doing this or if that even feasible     itd be cool to make our way down to da nang as well are there essential spots i gotta see not looking for huge parties but more nature food and architecture
is hanoi/halong bay/sapa/hue/hoi an/hmc doable in 3 weeks
  the fuck are you talking about  the only people selling shit ia the occasional old lady selling lottery tickets to locals or in the extremely touristy area there might be a guy selling ciggarettes and sunglasses but thats about it  are you an idiot u think any of these travel clowns r gonna go outside of the tourist area thats where these vendors hang out at because theyre targeting tourists 99 percent of people who travel to nam dont speak viet they have no reason to leave tourist areas unless they wanna communicate through hand signals only
  lol can you imagine being gullible enough to pay 100 usd for riding without a helmet in cambodia id tell them to give me the death penalty and they could see me in hell
  id tell them to give me the death penalty  they dont need to do that theyll just cart off your rented bike that you have left your passport as deposit for
hows this for an itinerary  day 1  4  hmc  day 5  fly to da nang  day 6  9  hoi an  day 10  car to hue  day 11  13  hue  day 14  fly from da nang to hanoi  next bit could be reordered its the number of days thats the point  day 15  18  hanoi  day 19  ninh binh day trip  day 20  21  halong bay return to hanoi on second day  day 22  hanoi then overnight train to sapa  day 23  24  sapa then overnight back to hanoi    i may north to south instead  but regardless  is this a reasonable amount of time
  where in vietnam could i find a cyberpunk aesthetic  doesnt really exist in vietnam you can get some bits of that in saigon but drugs arent particularly common or anything and skyscrapers arent much of a thing and neon signs arent as bad as hk  basically no
  i mean by tourist areas im thinking beu vien or whatever its called in the streets near vincom d2 some areas are 90 foreigners but you never see a single person selling anything on the streets
  then id go to the us embassy and have them get it for me those places arnt allowed to withhold your passport from you even if you dont give them their shit back sucks for them but i if you play into their games youre fucking it up for everyone id never give one of those monkeys 100 i would do 20 tops and thats if i am not busy that day and i was caught with hard drugs
  then id go to the us embassy and have those places arnt allowed to withhold your passport from you    you know nothing about cambodia i hear   a the embassy do not give a damn about your passport issues  b the rental company can deny they even have your passport and they are able to outbribe you when it comes to the cops  c cambodian law is what applies to cambodia  d this aint gullible whiteboy day its not gonna be gullible whiteboy day that day either theres a cell in phrey sar with your name on it people that misplace motorbikes end up in it    t phnom penh resident
  im guessing youre actually a bitter cambodian i also can guarantee youve had no dealings with the us embassy ask around they get shit done the laws are only cambodian laws until the embassy gets involved then the cambodians bend at the knee i would 100 never see a jail cell for refusing to bribe a cop it would turn into a gigantic shit show for them and they fucking know it
  useless language outside of vn  viets are still going to treat you like an outsider  even many rural locals can speak at least some english  google translate exists     why would you waste that much time the only vietnamese words you need to know are xin chao cam on and thuoc lao o dau
  bitter cambodian  not at all but it would be beside the point    i also can guarantee  no you can not i see larpers like you get into trouble on a regular basis    the laws are only cambodian laws until the embassy gets involved  that is even more nonsense fyi hun sen is a stooge of china he is not a friend of fatties     but pray tell me what life experiences has lead you to these peculiar conclusionshave you even been to cambodia
  basic info for a useless nonpassport holding child from     when you are in a foreign country you are subject to its laws  american officials are limited as to how they can assist you   they cannot for instance represent you in legal proceedings  or pay your legal fees or other expenses they can however   provide you a list of attorneys  assisting in contacting your family in the us     tldr much like everybody else they do not like you very much good luck in having them run errands for you nobody is gonna send a seal team to pick up a passport for you kid
  cringe or troll
    for anyone wondering the poverty stricken cambodians here are trying to make you think that they are legally allowed to do whatever they want with impunity from the us embassy and thats a lie also they are attempting to spread disinfo about how much one should pay for a bribe the cambodians are very poor very dumb people due to the genocide a generation ago 100 usd there is major remember many of these people are selling fried spiders on the side of the road to make ends meet it would be closer to probably 1000 in any country that matters dont fall for the lies
  confirmed troll nontraveller due to get into big big trouble on babys first excursion   you are not as special as your mama says you are stay in your basement
  that they are legally allowed to do whatever they want with impunity from the us embassy and thats a lie  impunity from the us embassy  impunity  you use that word but you do not know what it means
  one month of my rent would change your life forever ive been all over the place including cambodia mainly to fuck your women for a few bucks each and party my ass off with the poor folk if you really insist ill timestamp my passport
  uh do you know what the word means i used the word correctly
  is there any way to make a flight from ict to vietnam sgn cheaper fuck connections
  no you do not the impunity is not derived from the us embassy grammar is a bitch when you are a child you gotta go back  quick damage control
  clearly english is not your first language
  butthurt damage control 0/10 english is my first language it isnt for you you speak american fatty   the ones acting with impunity in your example would be they if you want to indicate that the impunity is derived from the embassy your sentence would necessitate a comma after the want     now go be obese somewhere else you stupid soon to be dead cunt
  well my point stands either way regardless of how poor my grammar is
  nah you have made no point except expressed some delusion that there are usfag pressure groups that would be sent out from the embassy to force motorcycle rental shops to hand over passports to their rightful owners all this despite the hackysack kicking little flyoverstate twink not having returned the motorcycle that he has left the passport as deposit for this is complete delusion and you have left no evidence circumstantial or not to support your argument as a matter of fact every real traveller knows that you are talking out of your wellworn derriere when you claim that usfag law extends outside the walls of the embassy    as a matter of fact any motorbike rental shop could and should rightly send such an imaginary envoy packing with spit flowing down his/her face which although degrading for the recipient no doubt involves less degradation than experienced by your mom when receiving ejaculate facially while servicing sailors on her knees down by the docks every day of every year
  away schedule
  awful
  youre missing a major part of this if the cops impounded the bike for refusing to pay a bribe and that resulted in the refusal to get your passport back then yes the embassy would absolutely get involved also lol at someone who is renting scooters trying to big time someone coming from the us embassy thats laughable youre completely deluded
  the bike is impounded because you break a law retard take it up with the state department you nontraveller it is against federal laws    officers of the department of state and us embassies and consulates overseas are prohibited by federal regulation from acting as agents attorneys or in a fiduciary capacity on behalf of us citizens involved in legal disputes overseas department of state personnel including its attorneys do not provide legal advice to the public    from      also you have still not provided a source or any proof you are just opining and having feelz put up or shut up you sore loser
  ive known people that have had similar things happen i know for a fact that they will put in a call for you and cambodians are low test enough where they buckle i feel very very certain that if the moped rental people were dickheads then they would send a person out there to talk with them either way the root of the argument was id have to pay a fine or id be stuck in cambodia which is a dumb premise it would take hey some scummy looking cambos stole my passport i need another one problem solved that said itd never come to that because cambodians know that americas arnt to be fucked with abroad
  4 days in hoi an  can honestly do everything in two days
  backtracking  ive known people  fuck you anecdotal evidence and it is doubtful that you know people   cambodians buckle  yet youve never been there larper    i can get a new passport  that is a copout and another solution altogether with any luck your sorry ass will be apprehended at the airport and in any case youd have to cut your holiday short and leg it and never come back     cambodians know that americas arnt to be fucked with  many cambodians would damage twinks like you beyond repair they dont give mercy even when you show you cant spell    also amused by the notion that your embassy cares about you and that cambodians hold usfags in esteem confirmed for not knowing anything about the region they still see you as bodybagescapees
  i feel very very certain  confirmed for just guessing your choice of words reveals all
  theres so much here to respond to i have no idea where to start ive been to cambodia before in phnom penh and sihanoukville from my experience cambodians are not intimidating at all i probably had half a foot on everyone in the entire country you must be cambodian to be so incensed about my blatantly true comments to touch on another thing you really truly believe that some cambo cop is going to throw me in jail for not giving them 100 dollars for a simple riding without a helmet charge thats insane man it dosnt even cost that much in neighboring counteries where the economy is 1000 times better       yeah pretty much
  it would take hey some scummy looking cambos stole my passport i need another one problem solved    not him but  that is a literal felony in this case good luck with that
  you must be cambodian to be so incensed about my blatantly true comments    you must be a gullible fool in more ways that one i am no cambodian i am reacting to your notion about motorbike rental companies taking 1000 dollar hits because you will not get a bike out of seizure      you really truly believe that some cambo cop is going to throw me in jail for not giving them 100 dollars for a simple riding without a helmet charge    never claimed they would they would throw you in jail for losing a bike though if you knew anything about the country youd know that anyone that knows the system can put you in jail by paying the right people    ive been to sihanoukville  then you know that in that place bikes get seized for small infractions at a 10x inflated rate compared to the rest of the country it is all over the grapevine as well as the forums and the news do keep up
way to ruin a thread faggots
    please elaborate    thanks noted
two yellow fever white faggots ruin a thread trying to measure dicks   good job boys
  american and a britton  white

  whiter than you
  this is a stupid plan youre spending such a short time youre spending a shit ton of money and ur not spending enoiugh time to do anything a fucking day in sapa do u know how long it takes to get to sapa fucking bafoon spend time in one or two cities maybe three whats the point of rushing around vietnam ur a foriegner anyway so its not like ull enjoy much outside of tourist areas
  way to ruin a thread faggots  i mean the thread was already kind of trash to begin with just look at the title gễnẻrậl wtf is this just using accents on anything the op doesnt know jack about vietnam the posters dont know shit about vietnam theres some good advice in this thread that it looks like no one even listened to
  you right you right will you tell me about the best way to trek in north vietnam
  this is a cambodia general now get out
  what backpackers need to do is explore just one region of vn in a month north south or central because you should explore the cities some cities are more foreigner friendly than others some overcharge everything some dont have a lot to do for a foreigner like huê its got tons of history but thats it hoi an is tourist city everything is overpriced unless u wanna take a trip outside the city for some cheap food the streets r absolutely crowded da nang is prob the best city for foreigners large and pretty modern nha trang is small and has nothing but old russians stay in one region maybe 3 cities and try to make some viet friends maybe ull meet a girl get familiar with the area trust me ull have a lot more fun than moving through the country by bus and plane and sleeping at hostels all the time then if u wanna see more of vn next time pick a different region then finally if u want to make the north to south trip then make it but by then ull be familiar with vn when u oust urself from the locals u half ur fun u limit urself to backpackers only
best time of year to travel to vietnam
anybody have any tips/rules on renting/driving motorcycles saigon
    i have 3 1/2 weeks fly into hcmc and out of hanoi    what are your thoughts on doing this for 22 1/2 weekseither in hcmc or da nangand using my last week to see phong nha and sapa    i intend to skip ha long bay nha trang hoi an and hue
  depends on the type of traveler  ive done one weak high movement travel in countries like china and yeah i didnt see anywhere near enough  but i had a fucking great time  people just need to learn what works for them and give it a go im happy for you because it sounds like you know what works for you
  get a phone ram mount     i spent my entire time navigating with phone in one hand and steering with another pain in the ass with a manual bike when riding think of it like being in a school of fish small fish stick together motorbikes and move in a group while big fish trucks are free to make any moves they want because theyre at the top of the food chain
is da lat worth visiting if im going to phong na and sapa seems like the latter two do what da lat does better
going to toronto for a week with a couple buds any recs on where we should stay or go see ive heard good things about the entertainment district but were all broke as shit and the housing is a bunch more also are the rumors true can i smoke teh weeds in canada now
    montréal
  why dont you visit googles new smart city project    kek
  yeah you can smoke weed but you would have to buy weed online thats if you wanna go the legal route unless you find a hookup from da streets if youre broke and in toronto i feel like youre gonna have a bad time especially now that its getting colder
    where should you go    probably anywhere else lmfao
best coffee i have had in my life was in toronto    won some major awards the year i went so tracked them down for a visit was not disappoint    propeller coffee  4chan wont let me post the google maps link    mh54q2 toronto ontario canada
   there are legal and illegal dispensaries everywhere now

dude
  i cant be that autistic if im regularly buying weed at speakeasy dispensaries that you are apparently unaware of
be me  solo traveling around the uk and possibly to ireland in a few months staying in hostels  socially retarded but would like to meet people  how exactly am i supposed to go into a bar and meet strangers arent they all there with their friends     should i just go on a pub crawl or something like that and meet other travelers
nobody meets anybody in bars do they  cook elaborate meals in the hostel kitchen so you can say hi to everyone who comes in and out its so easy to strike up a conversation about food its something everyone relates to thats your icebreaker then when youve all taken your meals into the dining room dont be afraid to say mind with i eat with you  thats how i meet people while traveling anyway t fellow social retard
  try to be social with multiple random people in a busy area while cooking an elaborate meal  live stream this pls
  anon is the kitchen microwaving his ramen  stacy comes in to steal food out of the fridge  mmay i sit with you mlady    what could possibly go wrong
  am irish so i might be biased but i think brits are way more closed off and shy than irish so might be harder to pick up a conversation with a random in uk instead of ireland also a general rule is the drunker they are the easier to start a convo with    just say hey or hows it going to whoever is sitting at the bar comment on the weather mundane shit talking normally progresses into more interesting conversation if you have an american accent an irish person might pick up on it and talk about that     you could just pretend to be trying to find something do you know anywhere i can get xyz someone might pick up that your travelling and have a chat with you
  turk herewe have an eveybody is family mentalitywhich helped me meet other people later onpeople just do shit like     and     everytime here and despite these possibly sounding dumb for youits entirely normal for othersjust try and talk about mundane shitwell begun is half done  bars and clubs are generally a whole different category but you can simply do what    says on small pubs and such too
  nobody meets anybody in bars do they  fairly common to meet people in the pub  t scot
sport is a good thing to bond over you often find more people go to the pub alone to watch sport    otherwise choose wisely you ideally need a bar where you can sit at the counter    meetupcom and similar sites like eventbrite can be good too    live music can also be a good place to meet people if the venue isnt too big songkick is a good site to see whats coming up in certain cities
  best thing you can do is try to work or volunteer at a place youll get set up with a group of people in the same boat
dude just name drop oasis the beatles the smiths they legit love that stuff
this seems pretty relatable for me anon    20 yo planning on doing a solo trip to the uk this summer and eager to meet people but a bit shy at first    i was just planning on hitting up tinder and going to bars    ill probably try to meet people at the hostels im at as well
  cook elaborate meals in the hostel kitchen so you can say hi to everyone who comes in and out    do not be that fucking idiot who thinks he is king master chef in the hostel unless you are making something simple for yourself seriously fucking cant stand those people who try to make some local cuisine and save money then fuck everything up and make the hostel stink     thats how i meet people while traveling anyway t fellow social retard  yeah this statement is on point for sure
purposely try to avoid people  still end up meeting loads of people while i travel  dunno how it happens people say i look very approachable so you may not necessarily have a hard time unless you have resting bitch face
  solo traveling around the uk and possibly to ireland in a few months staying in hostels    how horrifying
im in vietnam for one more week what are the rules for bringing back cigarettes to australia
  australians are border control nazis so you wont get to bring anything in
25 cigarettes  not packs but individual smokes  the laws suck
will be in ho chi minh for 5 days in december    what do i need to know  what are the best things to see in the city/surrounding area     i like food drinking live music/clubs nature/hiking museums or otherwise just exploring i dislike sex/drugs tourism dont need to go to another country to do these things      will i be entertained enough to dick around in the city for 5 days with a friend
  eat a lot of good food there are no art galleries or anything like that vietnam is as or probably more authoritarian than china i just enjoyed walking around drinking ice coffee and chilling in the park its a cool city
  thanks go to any dance clubs or anything like that    did you meet anyone vietnamese who spoke english
  not that anon    but my favourite bar perhaps in the world is in hcmc its called carmen its in an old wine cellar or so im told the door in is about 1 metre high so you almost have to crawl through inside is really good live music often latin followed by french vietnamese guy singing in perfect french    i really enjoyed it but i was drunk so maybe its not as good as i remember
finally went to thailand and made use of their services heres my journey    be me  been wanting to go to whore mecca for years  plan trip/but tickets  excite  fly over  get hotel and immediately go to hotspots  get girl  get bbbj  immediately feel ashamed of myself while doing so  see pimple on her chin  hypchondriacexe  convinced that ill end up having herpes  too anxious to even do anything  booked to leave early tomorrow what a waste    im retarded but ive been feeling nauseated over how i felt during it and if i got an std i feel dumb af
  herpes is no big deal
    this     unfortunately op you dont have herpes you have aids needless to say thats much much worse
  you cant get anything serious from bjs dont worry its more a risk for the girl hpv vaccine is recommended    i went to thailand earlier this year stayed in comfy hotels fucked a sweet 30something girl and then for variety got one of those young dark girls with the fake titties plus hung out with a local girl from tinder fun times cant wait to go back dont be ashamed i mean some people can get sex for free other guys gotta pay for it whatever thats just how it goes    my joints were sore for a couple months after i got back though im not sure if i caught something or ate a bit too much pad thai haha
  have u tried wearing a condom my anime posting friend
  sore joints is a common sign of bacterial stds like chlamydia and syphilis these are diseases that lay latent for years and then really fuck you up food would never cause sore joints and anything from walking would be better in a few days     go to the doctor and get some medication before your eyelids fuse to your eyeballs from gonorrhea or your brain turns to swiss cheese from syphilis
  lol im pretty sure it was from drinking the tap water im 100 fine now used a condom got vaccinated etc etc
  hey dude thanks still going home and going to spend my time off doing other things and worrying but you made me feel a little better
  for sex definitely my weeb appreciating friend
ah yes the animeposter correlates having a pimple in humid/polluted climate to having hiv    imagine my shock hearing you have to pay for sex
  i know im good for hiv anon and i know i may be somewhat irrational as well
  could you give a basic explanation of how you think the vaccine works i assune youre talking hpv
  im interested in hearing this too although the tap water in pattaya is garbage
  how is herpes not a big deal
  over 79 million people have the hpv virus at any time if you are sexually active with multiple partners you will catch it 24 million americans have hsv2 herpes in their system with many showing no symptoms herpes has been villainized by governments for ages when the simple matter is your chance of having it already are great you really should educate yourself about these things instead of living life in fear
  thanks ive been reading a bit today it does seem to be that many with it and many do have it are asymptomatic or the symptoms are negligible past the first flare up the social stigma is the largest thing i guess you could say which is still kinda scary desu
  you can contract aids through the open sores if you are a man usually men are at very low risk of contracting aids through hetero sex    if you are a woman it can lead to cervical cancer
  kys  you are an idiot  go and have condorless sex fucking idiot
  these are diseases that lay latent for years and then really fuck you up  unironically this chlamydia eventually renders you sterile a lot of people dont even know they have it they just feel a little tired    im lucky in that i caught it and my balls immediately felt like they had been punched repeatedly then i took the pills and the bugs all died horrible deaths but theyd already triggered an autoimmune problem that left me miserable for the next 18 months not even lying look up prostatitis
dont worry op  i always feel dirty and ashamed when i bareback some strange asian
i have barebacked over 100 ladyboys and i am still clean
  dont listen to the dumbass above apparently he thinks hpv and hsv herpes is the same thing a lot of people have hsv type 1 thats true not many have type 2 herpes genitalis fewer than 20 percent of the population has type 2 and youd do best avoiding whores since they are far more likely to have it outbreaks might be asymptomatic or leave you in debilitating pain that all depends on your immune system herpes has not been villainized by the government it is deemed unimportant enough to not be screened for on a normal std test however it was the big bad among stds before hiv appeared do more research and read on possible sideeffects people can experience if you happen to know youve got it how will you explain that shit to a potential spouse or girlfriend what do you think will happen    however it is true that hpv is very common and unless you get a virgin theres a strong chance youll get it if you decide to fuck hookers dont shave or at least wait a few days after shaving to allow your skin to heal hpv just as hsv are more likely transmitted through bruised cracked damaged or cut skin your pubic hair actually can protect you somewhat
  nah youre not just asymptomatic fuck off degenerate
  well op you should learn from this hopefully youll get away with a scare theres a very real chance ofgetting something from hookers and not all of it is treatable   fucked a hooker too spent the next 6 months living a hellish nightmare im a hypochondriac unfortunately i got hpv from that shit so wasnt as lucky as you id never touch a hooker again
  i was under the impression that most people have hpv and that it wasnt a big deal but i dont really know
  what are you to me  nothing  you will never experience the thrill of travelling thousands of miles to wander in ruined down ghettos under the glittering light of skyscrappers to embrace nimble and lithe bodies beckoning to you to engage in the deepest perversions out of desperation born of poverty  you will never find yourself surrounded completely by chorus of foreign languages singing to you to partake in pleasure natural to them and seen as immoral by moralistic jihad of anglosaxon puritanism  your morals will never melt away in in shady massage parlour in half forgotten town located where jungle meets civilization as you receive a 4 handed massage in a room full of incense as your ladyboy lover sits on the chair and texts his sponsor in new york asking him hows the weather and if he is happy with his career in government service  you will never stand up in the moonlight at the beach looking towards the sky as bodies of smiling satisfied prostitutes surround you    live your your own life as you pay your mortgage court a worn out woman produce children buy a car pay for school get stuck in traffic watch netflix merge with the gray mass of the same moral faceless automatons as you as you all march to the same endfeel free to do it    i will be fucking hookers in cambodia
  you have embarrassed yourself in front of all these people and made yourself a total clown
  it absolutely is a big deal imagine meeting a beautiful woman and wanting to have kids with her but telling her to hold off on the sex because you have the herpes virus     it is definitely a big deal because you can never get rid of it and the link between it and dementia is still undergoing dont be a fool herpes is no joke    there is also antibiotic resistant clap which is way worse than herpes and it too was in se asia     men do not get bbbj from hookers risk is not worth the reward unless you and the hooker both dont care about diseases in which case let it roll
  i was under the impression that most people have hpv and that it wasnt a big deal but i dont really know  it is no big deal at all and the guy you are quoting obviously is a retard
  herpes and dementia is hsv1 oral not genital
  not the guy you responded to but this was pretty funny good for you though anon do your thing are you really clean after doing all of that pretty amazing
  its not a big deal to explain to someone especially  if you love her cold sores thats herpes its nothing there is a hysteria about herpes that is not justified
  its a bid deal to explain to a lot of people really     anybody know where checks are available in thailand
just go and get checked if they ask why youre there just say you had unprotected sex in thailand with a girl and you are now worried you caught something getting worried and doing nothing is worse
i barebacked 4 girls in bangkok last month out of the 9 i had sex with 3 hookers and 1 cambodian good girl dont know what i was thinking since i used a condom with the rest of them it doesnt help that i am white early twenties good looking and i like the thrill of danger today i tested negative for hiv waiting for herpes and other std tests to come this week it was definitely not worth the stress ive had this month however i got to say it was the best sex ive ever had in my entire life the women fucked me for free and mostly for 2k baht all night will test for hiv again in january but i highly doubt i have anything at alll i feel fine    note to self buy decent condoms and a lot of them before going again you brainlet you got away with it this time
  fucking in condoms kek  i always bareback just take prep you crybaby
  thats only for hiv
  other stds are curable or harmless
  what are you talking about   hpv  virii that can cause warts very common might or might not be big deal can cause penile cancer cervical cancer or even throat cancer however generally harmless  hsv  herpes of which there are 2 kinds hsv 1 and 2 hsv 1 is very common and usually manifests itself as a sore or sores on the lip hsv 2 is genital herpes either type can occur in different areas however that is more rare however hsv2 is increasingly found more in the lip area due to oral being more common and hsv 1 in genital area    of these hsv 2 is by far the most unpleasant one if not asymptomatic it can cause recurring painful outbreaks read up on that
  i dont care what you think of me you are a degenrate faggot emrace that if you want i dont give a shit
    pic related its mine    i dont give a shit about taking anything before sex to not get aids i know for a fact i will have to do this again its fucking terrifying not knowing if you have hiv or not because you bare backed hookers     message to everyone thinking about screwing asians hookers or w/e you can stick your dick into    dont listen to anyone and use a condom
      btw im the same anon
  i did hiv tests like 20 times stop crying pussy
  fuck that i paid 40 for this if i was to do this 20x it would cost the same amount for me to screw 20 thai bar girls you know what i would rather do
  paying for hiv tests  you are new to this game arent ya
  i never said it wasnt hence why not to do a bare back blow job bbbj
  mouth herpes is harmless youre fine
  that sounds good and all but i cannot help but allude you to dying like zyzz the self satisfied loser being dumb and gay
    the sheer amount of retards who cant tell the difference between hsv and hpv when its been explained multiple times is astounding    hpv genital herpes is a big fucking deal and it certainly is an important hard thing to explain to a potential wife because once she catches it from you theres a good chance your children will catch it during childbirth which can lead to debilitating lifelong injury
  lmao hpv is not herpes is the wart virus man you done goofed yourself
  this guy seems to be the only one with a clue in this thread    hpv has a lot of bullshit around it though hospitals claiming to do tests for it are basically lying there are no reliable tests aside from scientific ones which arent done in hospitals it has a lot of different strains only a few cause genital warts but hpv in general is linked to cancer more dangerous for women than men most western countries vaccinate all teenage girls because of the risk for cervical cancer hpv cant be cured but can be worse when it flares up such as warts     basically anyone claiming they dont have it after fucking around are full of shit     if you barebacked prostitutes you have several strains for sure and your dick will have an increased chance to cause yourself or your women cancer
you pretty much deserve it for screwing adult hookers in a third world shithole next time go for a reputable place that provides you with 18 year olds use condom and inspect every inch of their body before sticking it in
  any of you know if its true if you have hsv 1 you are slightly more resistant to contracting hsv2
  wtf i love getting my shithole slammed by brown ladyboys now  thank you brother man
    lol just admit you got owned like the npc you are he wrecked you sweetie 
  those are harder to find than one would imagine
  that shit all happens in south pacific islands now if you know any effeminate scuba divers that say they are going to places like gizu theyre actually not going to dive into reefs but dive into little children  the kids grow up into raging violent alcoholics an ex gf of mine works for an ngo trying to track this sordid shit
  tell more genuinely curious
banged over 15 hookers the last 2 years in japan  not a single std tested regularly  real shit you have to be retarded to get a std even while receiving bbbjs
  i dont believe you
  not him but   pedo detected
  no settled science on it but going by expert opinions its not true the antibodies are different so it doesnt help
  i dont believe him because those islands are colonies administered by western countries who would never allow that to happen  i think hes a pedo doing fapfantasy
  actually with the great hiv drugs they have now that can get you to the nondetectable stage herpes is the worse of the two at that level you cannot even pass on hiv although you should wear protection and inform your partner whereas you can give someone herpes in a nonsexual contact
  whore mecca  i always thought that was macau even japanese porn stars go there to prostitute themselves to rich businessmen
  macau has world class prostitutes and whatever but only for the rich so clearly not something marketable towards 4chan users
thats why you only fuck virgins you autistic fucks
  where to find virgins who fuck for money  bareback
  good luck with that
  theres medicine to suppress herpes outbreaks too making you non contagious as long as you take it still sucks to be dependent on drugs either way
        hes not lying paul theroux the travel writer had a book called something like the happy islands of oceania in which he writes about the yam festival on one of those islands basically for a month girls are allowed to rape any guys they want and they do according to him the girls got quite predatory about it    i ran into a newspaper article about it again a few years ago and the article was talking about the spread of stds among the girls because sex tourists were going there and fucking up a storm with all the tweenagers
  no its not true your immune system will be slightly more effective at going after the viruses but that only means that the result wont be quite as bad not that you wont get it    the old chickenpox vaccine also helps to suppress it but it isnt a cure not sure about the new one thats come out
this thread is some sad sad shit
thailand must have nasty shit
  i did something stupid  god punished me accordingly
  they do but its not always the places youd expect iceland has its own mutant drug resistant chlamydia as well
  what all vaccines did you get for protection against stis
  dont be ashamed i mean some people can get sex for free other guys gotta pay for it whatever thats just how it goes    no thats not how it goes some men do prefer gfe freebies even it eventually costs more in terms of money and time with hookers there isnt time to know each other and build intimacy     t someone who has hired sws from most of sea countries
  fuck off anglosaxon npc unlike you most of the humans like sex    you get latin lovers and english patients
     some forgotten island on papua new guinea    how does this beat phillippines exactly

berlin london miami brooklyn kiev tbilisi ibiza moscow amsterdam buenos aries detroit chicago      where is the absolute best city to find some mdma and go dancing to some techno/house music   what djs did you see   how easy was it to find drugs  what were some cool things you did/ate when not partying   whats a good budget to go on a multi city tour on   are there any cities that arent considered the best in the world yet are still solid spots for some partying   what about some festivals   yes techno/house is a must hell even some edm is alright    i got 3 1/2 more years of my navy contract but once im done and done exploring the parts of the world the carrier takes me too i wanna go hard on partying and get it all out of my system for six months before i reenlist or try to go to officer candidate school   so im planning this trip three years in advance
bump
  saw ayarcana and orphx in berlin  10/10 experience pills were 5 euros each and easy to find     cant speak for detroit or chicago but miamis a cringe fest for electronic music  the music is shit and people seem to think a rave is dressing like a cross between a furry and a red indian listening to avicii and paying 200 for a bottle of vodka with sparklers in it for instagram
  ultra is like that and the winter music conference is like that but there are some gems out there club space though they do have bottle service and the electric pickle are great though the electric pickle in particular has no bottle service is a small intimate room with nothing but a bunch of people rolling and dancing their ass off at space ive seen ame tale of us flight facilities matador and a few others who arent that washed down edm that we all love to hate   there are a couple underground clubs in miami that i gotta check out when i go back home       you arent officer material if you wanna spend your free time rolling balls
  how do i get a cute rave gf
amsterdam most of the year is just a smaller version of berlin ade is definitely worth considering de school shelter radeon garage noord are my favourite places to go to and they all fit what youre looking for id say but berlin is definitely superior every week you get to see world class djs if you want to    london wasnt that great compared to other cities ive been but probably easiest for one night stands
  is it really hard to get into some berlin clubs as they say it is or is that just a meme
  be my best friend   party all weekend in berlin decide to go to berghain  waits in que for 3 hours somehow gets in  says its the gayest place hes ever been too  goes to take a piss and theres a dude on the floor jacking off asking people to pee on him   at walks up to him and ask him if he would fuck her boyfriend   guys blowing each other by the bar     why would anyone wanna go to a place like this
  why would anyone wanna go to a place like this  if you have to ask you will never understand
  i just wanna dance on my pill to some techno and i understand the music originated in gay clubs but cmon
  so shut up and dance you didnt get raped if a bloke is fapping on the floor in the loo it means that the women in the place are pretty liberal too also no it did not originate in gay clubs on this side of the pond
  but it did on this side of the pond fagget
  so then you know that techno did not originate in gay clubs on this side of the pond you noob
    where is the absolute best city to find some mdma and go dancing to some techno/house music  berlin for parties amsterdam for cheap and available mdma    what djs did you see  going for bigname djs gets boring after a while see what you like and trust clubs/bookers i rather go to places with homegrown residents or with a more leftfield programming    how easy was it to find drugs  in the cities i mentnioned you can ask a couple people and someone usually has an extra pill for 5 euro    what were some cool things you did/ate when not partying  i live and work in the nl so regular stuff i guess    whats a good budget to go on a multi city tour on  if youre gonna be partying 2 times per week expect a budget of 100usd per day    are there any cities that arent considered the best in the world yet are still solid spots for some partying  the whoremongers of this board consider bangkok a mecca of degeneracy for some reason even if drugs are not in the picture    what about some festivals  the summer and nowadays even the winter is filled with festivals in the netherlands biggest/best/most well known are dekmantel music purists awakenings big name techno lowlands 3 day genre bender smaller but worthwhile are stafwerk soenda drift draaimolen zeezout dgtl into the woods we are electric etc     plus youve got ade where the entire city of amsterdam is one drugged up mess for a week    berlin has more of a steady club scene is less commercial and focused on the incrowd    so im planning this trip three years in advance  nightlife can change a lot in three years look at london dont plan trips so far in advance      retarded post
    this is why amerifats should not be allowed in berghain did you pretend to be mute at the door
  i think its hard for people who are used to north american clubs but otherwise its really not bad not everyone in berlin is some face tattooed techno warrior thats not the only demographic in clubs
  nightlife can change a lot in three years look at london   what happened to london
  half the clubs closed down
acid has become my city exploring drug of choice whos dropped in a club good idea or should i stick to m and cannabis
are there jungle clubs/events in amsterdam
  good thing he didnt go into the lab oratory    that whole joke about not being able to unsee things is way too true that being said the ice cream at berghain is legit
  isnt that a fetish party
    how exactly is it different explain it to someone with a small brain who has only clubbed in north america     does bangkok have good electronic music clubs
  i dropped at the electric pickle wasnt a bad time but me personally id just roll
  theres still loads you fucking dolt  fabric corsica fold paintworks whatever    unsound is fuckin tight ill say
  circus in tokyo    soichi terada is playing there soon  
  many clubs have a door policy with clear goals getting in the people who look like theyll spend a lot of money and then just get in as many women as possible in berlin and id say any techno club worth going to its not about turning up with a nice buttondown but rather looking like youre the type of person who is actually interested in the music this doesnt mean going full technocore with what youre wearing but just wear something practical other common door policy tips are not to turn up with a big group dont arrive drunk/obviously high and be that cunt being loud in the queue basically what you want to achieve is acting as locals do looking into whos performing at the place youre going to is something id advise as well some bouncers ask you about it    this may seem like a lot of things to keep in mind but its mostly just common sense not bragging but just following these guidelines ive been able to get in pretty much anywhere since i was 17
  so tldr just use common sense in any country and you should be able to get it   i mean fuck even in miami or nyc theyre not gunna let you in  out for being in a group of 5 dudes drunk as shit being loud as fuck while in line because you were too busy pregaming to try to get in
  yes

  honestly it sounds douchey but the method of logic for these places is if you have to ask youre not the type

best shoes for walk for sightseeing i was thinking in buy some air max 97 but i want to read some recommendations
how far are you planning on walking sometimes when travelling ill just follow my nose for hours in a city and see what i come across its fun to feel a bit lost  ive probably walked 1015 miles on occasion for that ill wear what they call approach shoes which are rugged enough for a whole days walking on city streets
  i would honestly just buy some comfortable hiking shoes   t walks a lot
  have you tried anything with the nike special field boot sole im trying to find something i can wear hiking but also possible wear to nicer places and the nike sfb bomber seems to cover that
  you can pack two different pairs of shoes bro
  trying to get into the carry on only meme and need all the space/weight saving i can get
  buying nike for anything other than looks    dont do it
  just get a good traveler backpack bro make sure to rig it so people cant pickpocket you
can you provide more information like what kind of environment will you be walking through and what kind of weather youre expecting  if youre just going to walk through a city for a couple of hours then any comfortable walking shoes will do
merrells    just make sure you wear a bumbag fleece and your bag has an america flag somewhere on it
before going to japan this year i got a pair of skechers with memory foam and other meme enhancements theyre very plain looking but very comfortable and bonus waterproof    they were perfect for sightseeing in urban areas but they might not be appropriate for hiking
  did europe with leather soles    cobblestones suck but i was fine walking shoes in urban environs are a meme even in fields desu
  what does rig it mean
wear anything branded a running shoe if youre trying to get laid dont wear dad shoes like skechers or new balance
ecco shoes are the secret weapon look stylish but have nike runner levels of support and cushioning
  ultraboost or get the fuck out
  how are ultraboosts for travelling long walks and hikes and such
  modify it so that people cant pickpocket you or they get a nasty surprise for their long fingers
good pair of running shows will do and theyre light weight i go for asics gel kayano
  excellent may want to go with the all terrain or the ultra boost tr mids if you plan on doing some intense hiking
  the materials in the upper and stuff dont tear thats what im afraid of most putting some 200 bucks down on comfy shoes and them breaking on me during the first real hike
bump
  depends where you hike    if by hiking people mean walking far along paved trails theyll be fine a lot of people consider runyon canyon hiking    they offer very little ankle protection and would likely fall apart if your hike involves crossing streams or any mud     i personally wouldnt trust the glue i hike in arizona and the soles can start to peel away from the shoe because the glue softens in the heat would probably be the same in humid countries too    i have some nb hierro trail runners for everyday runs and hiking theyre pretty good but if im going to anywhere challenging i take some proper boots
for city trips take ultra boosts    if youre actually hiking buy some real hiking boots
  can someone help me please    okay heres the problem i get very sore feet from walking around in europe all day just the bottoms of my feet not the ankles or anything mostly in the heels i tried wearing solid boots slipper type shoes even bought some skechers and still doesnt fix the problem    is this normal do i need to just train my feet or am i flat footed or something
  have you tried using all those fancy foot pads for your shoes  you can also get your foot print analyzed for a custom sole if you find that the commercially viable ones dont provide the support you need
    kek i have a pair of waterresistant merrell hiking boots bought them before going to ecuador and have worn them most days since pretty solid shoestheyve held up over several trips to latin america and india theyre comfortable on my motorbike too         tbqh you dont need anything special unless youre going on trails or through the mud most of my travel is to warm climates and i find sandals or dress shoes to be completely adequate for putting on 10 or more miles per day     not sure why youd think you need special apparel just to walk
  oh okay i might try that ill have to find a place thanks    so is this an issue other people face  this happened when i was walking around for maybe 10 hours a day for a few days in a row
  op i just bought some merrel moab 2 vent type recently and cannot recommend them enough  shopped around a lot as i have back problems and need solid support  money was no object to me and i just needed the best and most supportive walking boots/shoes possible  they are incredible  i am rehabing from an injury as walking for 5 miles teh other day is like walking 30 for most people  i barely had any problems and felt great after thanks to the support and how they seem to promote good posture  get thee to amazon and find a pair
  nike freaking destroyed my feet their soles get old so quick  get really thick soles or just some hiking shoes  some scandi brands do fancy ones
reminder that hiking boots are a mostly a boomer meme and have no real advantages over hiking shoes except maybe if youre worried about snow getting in your shoes
                                                            
    do you have literal autism
  no figurative
  75 yo american traveling to normandy the shoes
literally walked 1000s of miles in these over 5 years through a dozen countries through cities deserts and up mountains 10/10 comfort never worn out looks great with every outfit imaginable   i imagine stan smiths would be the sam deal but i dont have any so cant vouch for them
  i had the opposite experience seems like they need an insert to actually work i wore them on a 3 week trip in japan with a lot of day hikes last year and my knees were in pain after the 1st week the waterproofing didnt work either as rain and puddle/stream water just flowed in through the vents wore asics nimbus or cumulus cant remember which model on a similar trip to japan this year and had no issues with my knees still not waterproof but no worse than my merril moab in that regard i recently bought a brand called vessi that actually is completely waterproof and very breathable great shoes
one of these the brand ofc not this particular model   they are running shoes but they have been more comfortable for me than any other kind of shoe ive tried and i tried a lot of shoes because i also walk a lot and my feet start aching very soon
  whats the brand
  stylish  ecco  pick one    honestly youre probably just fat    really depends on the shoe a high end leather sole shoe from a legit brand like vass or bonafe will be comfortable for extended walking provided you pick the correct last for your foot a marginal quality leather shoe like allen edmonds might be alright for some people low end leather most of the shit reddit jacks off over like red wing trickers etc is going to be horrible youre better off getting a pair of those fugly cole haan dress casual sneakers
  how to look like a korean twink    how to look like an old woman wearing a sunhat    in my experience these work very well
any adidas boost are the best pavement pounders you can buy
  how to look like youre still in high school
  what are fucking autistic or something
  97s will hurt your feet if you wear them a lot   id stay away from retros in general   the nike epic react is pretty nice but ultraboost are still the comfiest shoes on the market
  youre autistic af if you associate plain white leather trainers with korean twinks everyone has a pair you cant go wrong with stan smith style those vans are for old men in that colourteenage girls in any other
air  force  one  if youre in england people will think you are a dangerous drug dealer and leave you alone in these shoes
  not comfortable but retro cool as fuck      stan smith style i agree for some reason i find the real stan smith fucking ugly pinhole stripes are fugly they would look so much better with stitched stripes like superstars or well 99 of the other models from adidas  doesnt help my grandfather wore stan smith when i was a kid in the end of the 80s
  energyboost for me desu
those nikes were hot about 3/4 years ago
common projects  /thread
can someone recommend a good walking show that isnt nike
   honestly youre probably just fat  well honestly im more of a skelly but thanks for the help
where did you move to    i live in the bay area of california and plan to leave this place was thinking montana because of its openness the cost of living here is crazy    what is the cost of living in your state or new location what are the pros and cons of living in your new state/area are there many places to travel to within your state
  holy shit same here anon i grew up in califorina mainly in socal los angeles i love the deserts and some great places but man it not looking good right now this place keeps getting worse with the housing market at its worst expensive shit and people want to keep raising the minimum wage and god people here can be rude if you dont know them crime isnt going down and places are becoming barriovilles and dont pin me as a polack for saying that i took a trip up to norcal not by san fran or sacramento and found it to be a breath of fresh air im looking forward for montana too with a boat load of reasons i just cant stand this place anymore i feel you man
  haha nah i feel you on the whole barrioville thing man the bay area traffic has gotten so bad that it takes an hour to get to some nearby cities    montana just seems like greener pastures because of less traffic open space nature real albeit harsh winters and affordable housing
yeah go to montana and raise the rent prices and bring your drugs and californian bullshit and make it california part 4 youve already ruined oregon and washington
  if you dont like living in your state than move  but dont come to my state because youll ruin it
  oh yeah i forgot about the traffic too god damn and the gas tax is the salt on the wound for it
  this  if youre not gonna bring all of the california bullshit to another state then its all good and you definitely should move you could also move up to far northern california
  yeah far northern califorina is really great even if its not completely perfect wish state of jefferson can become a thing
yeah i dont anticipate shitting up another state by changing another state into californias mold im trying to venture out and live somewhere where taxes are not the death of folks and where there are places and towns to travel to    im also trying to move to a place where there are jobs too
im in the exact same position anon 21 living with my parents 45 min north of sf they are moving down to san diego and i dont know if i want to go down with them dont have enough money to live in norcal on my own so i gotta leave have literally nothing holding me down i can go anywhere in the country i was thinking of moving to the east coast but holy shit idk if i can get used to the winters there is chicago as bad as people say i like urban centers and chicago seems pretty damn affordable compared to the alternatives so its an option im holding onto i wish i could just stay here in the bay but the prices are outrageous
  what makes you want to head toward chicago
go to jew york city we dont want you shitting up white areas i know people who will throw poisened meat in califags and jew yorkers yards to kill their animals we do not want you here
  you have to go back  
  echoing this x1000 its actually unbearable how awful you transplants make every state you move to
  just because we have the money to afford the shit you cant
  shuddup nerd    hes sort of right though californians claim they want to get away from it but when they move they turn wherever they move to into california from the tone of your comment it sounds like you are one of these people and you need to stay where you belong
  youre thinking of la hipsters/scum whose actor dreams have been squashed and want to move away somewhere quaint    they are the ones turning every state into vegan nonbinary mumbojumbo shit i just want a decent affordable house with a porch and to be left alone
  socal here the level of cuckery here in ca is above and beyond anything you can imagine     shit jobs unless you are mexican or black no one will hire you cant get into university with 36 gpa because of affirmative action letting people in with 25 gpa     housing is prohibitively expensive too crowded taxes are off the charts and were it not for hollywood or the legal weed here this place would be bankrupt beyond comprehension     thought about utah texas florida and va va has a few places very good like roanoke manassass arlington just outside dc
  how do you vote im guessing like a faggot you ruined cali now you want to shit every other place up i really hope you fags secede in 2020 id personally donate my time extending the wall to cover yall
  i may live in california but i dont consider myself onboard with the rest of the degenerates out here whining about people misgendering their dogs    what crawled up your ass friend im going to move to your state
  what lol are you trying to imply that moving out of california to somewhere in the us is a luxury that no one else will be able to afford    travel to reno for example and ask the native nevada people what they think about their city after the influx of californians arrived youll find your answer there
  yeah i doubt that because im east coast you say youre not like them but you are you vote blue because im just a normal guy and think that if we can help someone we should which in reality translates to you wypipo need to pay higher taxes and abolish boarder laws bigot
  nah man im not blue im red living in a blue bubble thats why i want to move out to some place where higher taxes are frowned upon
  in that case youre fine with me nc is open for recruitment its pretty damn nice here
  right on man i worked with someone who actually moved out there for graduate studies lots of nature i bet you guys get real seasons too all i have is spring and summer
  yeah we get all of them this year it feels like its jumping right into winter but yeah the economy is great the people are nice and we have everything from beach to mountains
  stay the fuck out of texas and tell your faggot friends too
  friend they are already in texas look at austin
  fuck off faggot you caliniggers are fucking everywhere here in texas raising the goddamn housing prices here reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
  more development my dude it comes with it im afraid im seeing that shit here in my california area and its driving me nuts everything is expensive
  yeah you clearly dont understand these things please stay in your garbage state and leave the rest of the country alone
  oh ok cool man 
  no chicago is an amazing city you definitely want to stay out of the west and south side taxes in illinois are absolutely fucked though so be sure to look those up
  stop fucking replying to that faggot and give him what he wants he sounds like the typical /pol/ npc spouting their shitty ideology everywhere
  hey newfag hang yourself
anyway so besides they hate us cuz they aint us where can decent californians with your values move to to abandon this degenerate state    i heard georgia is nice
  no you fling money at things locals can afford and prices rise accordingly locals are priced out but californians still think its cheap the result is towns of nothing but californians who think theyre living in some comfy small town when its really nothing but a californian transplant colony
  boise idaho
  whats the vibe out there like weather
  go to utah stay out of florida
  fuck off were full
  iraq
stay down south anywhere father north than portland is literally freezing for 6 months of the year minimum asians have price deverything to beyond california and the crime is so bad you risk being shot just walking down the street    seriously dont come here i hear theres some really nice small towns on the interior of california though
fuck off were full  the housing markets in your state says otherwise
  no jobs in small rural california
  fuck off fag were full
  where are you from and how does one move there and assimilate leaving all the city stuff behind
  see 
  same here anon born and raised in la want to move to texas and just be miles away from my nearest neighbor
    let me flip the question on you is it worth moving to california i am a 3d artist worked in games and film and thought the weather and pay would be better there of course the rent may very well nullify everything
  raising the minimum wage is fine we need fucking rent control i dont give a fuck what the kike landlord association says were not nourishing you faggots anymore
born and raised in the bay been here my whole life the thing im tired of the most here is the fucking sausage fest the drought is real my dude     i stay because where the fuck else can my dumb ass get paid six figures for making powerpoint presentations if i had a more marketable skillset i would love to move to nyc i visited once and i was floored by the droves of fine ass women everywhere     i know plenty of people who left the bay but they mostly stayed in ca usually sac or la what states are you considering op
  im from anaheim myself born and raised in santa ana left in 14 because money houston was a great move humidity was actually more bearable than i thought moved in 17 again to new mexico its amazing how cheap it is to live here but crime is definitely higher than la on a per populous rating     the best thing about new mexico is the nature to be honest santa fe has some nice spots in the mountains taos has the best snow ive been in     just move out already youll be happier you did
  youre playing a high stakes game if you move there a 10 paycheck increase is not worth a 50 rent increase shit dont balance
  because rent control worked so well in permacucked la if youre poor stop trying to live above your means and move to a more affordable area or bitch about californias stupid zoning laws to allow more housing to be built so plebs can afford it
  why not just move to a lower cost of living area in california
  no jobs
  yeah rural californian cities/towns are cool to live in when you dont need to work
  i used to live in death valley but now all the way to maryland cheaper gas high wages but also high cost of living although its livable since the taxes arent as high as compared to cali
  i was considering colorado texas or washington for jobs
  reeeee dont move to my state
  i bet your state has lots of jobs a nice housing market decent folk and lots of places within the state to travel to gonna guess you live in colorado
  are the people in new mexico welcoming
liberals breed like crazy in california keeping it blue forever  people move in droves across the us to major cities and spread their way of thinking/living over there turning every fucking city more left and degenerate  it really is a sick cycle that unfortunately cannot be stopped the only redeeming thing being that these transplants cant stand to live in rural areas so they are safe for now
  reno    yurop here and ive been to reno so im generally curious what their attitude is i tried to avoid politics there but i did get a host who threw trump right at my face when i said i kinda have to like him since his wife is from where i live
  thats because californians move to escape the high cost of living then in their new state they vote for the same things that made california so expensive in the first place californians literally voted to keep a 12 cent per gallon tax on gasoline yesterday
  this    i live in a small country town in california ive never been to la or sf in my fuckin life i dont even know what you uptight niggers are talking about
  california is expensive because of voters  holy fuck youre a retard this state could be inhabited by literally anyone and would still be expensive 99 of what makes california what it is is its geography
  wages are shit and housing is getting more expensive due to geography and not because we are inviting latinos and other unskilled labor who drive down wages and compete with us in the housing market    okay
i just quit my job here in san francisco and am thinking about vegas i love it there and go several times a year on trips but i hear different opinions from people i talk to who live there for me i look at what i pay rent here can get me triple the space/privacy there and if i can find a job that pays close to the one i just left here i can live pretty high on the hog any las vegans want to talk me out of it
please come to texas youll fit right in and youll love it so much you wont want to spend a single second reminiscing on how great california is and how much you wish texas was just like california i would especially suggest austin they have plenty of room to spare and people there are always happy to be graced by the presence of yet another californian if you have any opinions on barbecue pickup trucks or the minimum wage please let us know because we would love to get your input
  youre confused friendo  liberals breed  ok lets think about this for a sec the breeders are who mexicans blacks asians white people arent really breeding particularly sjw liberalstheyre too fucked up about gender to even know how to breed or theyre too busy with their careers    besides native califags cant help that weve become a magnet for crazies sjws flock here from your states    people move in droves  yeah mostly a decent white people b people who cant stand leftist sjw bullshit c people who vote red and want to be in a red state    so what does that leave good people coming to the rest of the country while the problems are contained in california believe me native californians would much rather have all these trashy fags go away and leave our state alone but its a bit too late for that isnt it so if we come give us a fair shake to fit in and contribute and well try to not fuck up your wonderful way of life that we are joining in    t californian
  t californian  not surprised
  and colorado idaho is next boise rents are up 40 in the past year california blows and everyone knows it so they relocate and take the shit with them that made california blow in the first place    im more worried about the rabid leftists from the bay area communists in name but usually and ironically very well off    this is why everyone hates californians limousine liberals taking normal cities and turning them into minisan franciscos complete with the degeneracy and unbelievable income disparity
  californians are locusts who will never take responsibility for their locustbeing
  cant get into university with 36 gpa  not true but only because the state universities here are giant fucking scams trying to enroll as many students as possible then forcing them into gender studies by letting all of the valuable classes get full   its probably the same in the rest of the country but i wouldnt know here in ca they are scamming us hard   everything else you said is completely true though hollywood and agriculture are the only thing bringing value to this state but piracy is killing hollywood so pretty soon if no regulations change ca is done
  ever consider decent californians trying to escape this degeneracy
ive lived all over the place in california i feel pretty bad for people who dont live in orange county or south of there by san diego    norcal is nice too but its literally on fire a few times a year lately
all the evidence you need for understanding how retarded /pol/fags beliefs and rhetoric is is to read them talking about the actual area you live in if they are this far off imagine the legitimacy of all their views its like asking the guy you thought was smart about a topic you know about and hearing just spout absolute bullshit lmao thanks for the lesson guys really appreciate it
  please no youve already ruined the city with your shit drivers and whatnot
  scratch out florida out the list its worst than cali  all the other ones are great va is fine but watch out for racist cops giving you a speeding ticket of 1000 for doing 50mphother than that is great
  fuck off were full 
its good you guys are afraid of cold weather  we will be the last to fall to you
  we have adapted we have thick jackets now leave the light on for us 
  this is true i remember going to chicago in january how the fuck do you losers survive and deal with that shit i thought it was cold when it gets to like 35 in the winter here
  its retarded people in seattle that ruined washington  60 or so of the population of washington live in seattle
dont act like the rest of the states didnt have problems before californians moved there most other states had zero economies lol
which states have the best camping spots
  california
  kek
  lived in paradise  in the red county of butte  house burnt to the ground  voted only red and lost on everything  hate california  want to move elsewhere with insurance money  everyone we will meet in new state will think we are sfo fans  it hurts anons i just want a red state for my family to live i want to have guns low taxes and people to do what they want on their property i was looking at new orleans also curious about tennessee kentucky or georgia     any input would be helpful
  sfo fags   sage for typo fuck phone posting but its all i got
  montana  anons  im not american  tell me about these states  montana oregon colorado and wisconsin
ausfag lived in oc wanted to move to georgia or tennessee     ended up moving home anyway the relief you feel getting off at the sleepy australian airport is palpable
  montana is called the last best place for a reason the nature is unparalleled in the lower 48 have encountered bears moose elk deer hiking fishing is great too we have more breweries per capita than any other state the worst one ive been too would be considered decent anywhere else    however  few jobs for most popular professions  everyone knows everyone so connections are important  cost of living in cities really they are just large towns can be a bit high relative to what you will be making  if you dont like drinking you wont fit in  if you dont like hunting you wont fit in  you dont realize how much the cold can fuck things up until its 20f  there is a lot of land but most of it is already owned the cheap places are in areas with no jobs or on property polluted by mine tailings or other pollution or both anaconda libby    that being said you can make a good living in places like nyc or ca but you can live a good life here
  california blows and everyone knows it so they relocate and take the shit with them that made california blow in the first place    let me fix that for you    white europeans blow and everyone knows it so they relocate and take the shit with them that made white europeans blow in the first place    there you go bruh
  i dont buy the political migration narrative about this whole california thing the 1 factor to people leaving california by a large margin is the rental and housing costs even if other factors are involved in the choice to leave its the check every month thatll decide to big move for most the housing costs to the amount of wealth produced by these area is a a normal ratio the same shit is seen in almost every wealthy western major region and has nothing to do with specific california policy the amount of people this crazy wealth is drawing drives up the housing costs further the difficulty of building quick high density housing is difficult in every city in america only less so in nyc because of idiosyncratic building codes there   i think people underestimate how much wealth such a small population california produces its 40 million people and richer than the uk who is surprised that this effects the national currency of the country this region is located in how ignorant are the american public who think such a region as influential and wealthy on the world scale somehow wont influence the states backyard people take the border map of the usa too literally as reality from years of its repeated use in schooling instead of population density and wealth if you offer free travel through these made lines people will cross them
i moved to nyc because i fucking hate car culture i love the climate in ca i love the food and i generally love the people assuming palo alto is a good representation of ca obviously debatable    the housing is more expensive per square foot compared to the bay area but its worth it to have a smaller space and not be road raging inside a metal box for 20 hours a week
  agree 100 i live in a great place but have a need to live in a walkable city also happen to live in a country where thats the rarest people think im trying to move to nyc because of the energy or some shit and am dumb because of the housing costs but i would easily live in a cheap second or third rate city if it was dense and walkable like nyc or sf thats all i care about most countries in the world have that option accept america ill live in a cheap city in europe if i lived there because they are all dense and most are beautiful clean and safe in america its either live in a suburb cheap city center where you might get shot on your way home every day or a moderately dense city paying in personal organs for rent
  anaconda  pop of 9298  9th most populous city in montana  what the actual fuck
  stay in fucking california the only thing worse than california liberals trying to turn every western state into san francisco is california conservatives you guys like guns and religion and red culture not because you grew up in that kind of culture but because youre edgy contrarians from growing up in a shitty liberal suburb people in idaho and montana and georgia are conservative because they grew up in towns and families with traditional values not because they spent their life on autistic antarctic spearfishing forums you might not think it but youre never going to be fully accepted because your basic values and upbringing are different
  please dont move somewhere and vote for the same policies that drove you out of california  t texan
lol at the backward ass texan hicks crying about californians dragging their shitty state into the 21st century    theres a reason austin is the best place in all of texas
  if texas is so shitty than why are californians flocking here
  its pretty great honestly you dont realize how much nicer things are with fewer people around i like places like nyc but wouldnt want to spend more than a few weeks there lack of nice restaurants is a bit of a bummer but there is plenty of wild game to cook with which sorta makes up for it
  to make it better while saving money in the process
  you dont realize how much the cold can fuck things up until its 20f  20f  cold
  its actually like 100 increase for engineers/computer scientists if youre in the midwest
id love to tell you where i live but youd probably bring all your fucked up ideals with you   typical cali snot that moves to my area and tries to end field burning tried to promote diversity  and general faggetry stay in cali
  just do me a favor and remember that your politics ruined california when you get somewhere else rethink your ideas    yet youre moving because you cant afford rent this is the attitude that everyone hates
  i gave 21k for a shithole gave 10k and put 5k in a rental paid 45k for a 3 bedroom on 4 acres nearest neighbor is a mile away we are saving for a /diy ski lift between our houses
  btw northeastern ok
          pure unadulterated cringe
  im originally from texas but i lived in santa barbara for the last 5 years     just moved to seattle this summer pros are lots of good food and hiking cons are the cost of living is still pretty high if you want to be in the city its still way better than san francisco though not nearly as good as austin though     if youre into outdoors shit then youll never run out of places to travel to the airport is good for cheap flights though plus canada and portland are easy for weekend trips the bus to portland is like 15 bucks
  oklahoma reverse grapes of wrath
  how bad is the supposed seattle freeze really i never had trouble making friends anywhere ive traveled or lived in but theres this reputation about seattle is it real or is it the petty traits americans larp about their home city or state in order to differentiate it from the rest of the country weather is fine with me i dont mind rain and it makes no difference in a city imo because most of your time is spent indoors or walking to another indoor place
have you ever found yourself on a trip to the other side of the planet thinking fuck what am i doing here i want to go home
  everything is better than home anon
  the absolute best travel for me at least concludes just as you reach the point of missing home more than you are enjoying the trip
  yes first few days after arriving in delhi but then i got used to it and stayed in india for 5 months
  i want to go home  ive never had this thought ever
  in athens after a few days didnt have the best time there had quite a few problems with the locals but had to stay anyways for a whole week
  after being an aimless expat for a few years i realized i was just wasting time and wanted to go home to be a good little wageslave
  i had that thought in south korea once when i was fighting with mt asian girlfriend over something stupid my dad had just died and he was my best friend who i could tell anything and then when he died i had nobody and found myself in asia fighting with my girlfriend     i just wanted to yo home becsuse i felt so alone with korea being very keep to yourself the fight and not having anybody to turn to it was also winter there and cold that didnt help i eventually got over it but i think i wouldnt go back without a native korean
  this i got bit by bed bugs my toothpaste exploded in my bag ruining a ton of clothes i was at 3 weeks without jerking off i missed my cat was starting to seriously penny pinch to get by and heard hold on were going home on the radio all in the last two days of my trip
  just when i have a horrible airport experience like a 3 hour delay inside a plane    outside of that never i always find something to do that doesnt make me think of home and if something is wrong you only need to find another activity
  my toothpaste exploded  worry not   ziploc masterrace reporting in    ever since i met mike a good african american whose both toothpaste and bar deodorant exploded leaving him with a total mess at his first day in amsterdam i started using those little cheap bags
home is an ambiguous termi guess in the context of the forum it refers to your home country    first time was only one half id spilled my honda cb1300 less than an hour into a five day moto journey across japan while attempting to execute a u turn on a twitsy two lane road on the izu coast one of those guys driving a tiny japanese cargo truck stopped and helped me lift the bike i rode back to the cafe id passed and awkwardly managed to order water and coffee sat overlooking pacific break on the cliffs below supping my cup with trembling hands literally asking myself who the fuck do you think you are what are you doing here
  fucking phone posting garbagewhy even try well ill try harder on this one    second time was when i was scouting a route through mexico and central america for the group that was planning to do this trip with me in reverse months later ended up buying the bike in cancun down through belize and over to guatemala i had intended to go further south but guatemala kicked my ass on the eve of my birthday i made the mistake of haggling an 8 hotel rate largely because my conversion was fucked up but also because i was tryingg to make it a general point to practice el gordo gave me that room i distinctly remember having a moment aisde with the 8 year old assistant asking if it was safe no well i met and drank with a cool doctor guy from next door and a couple young dudes at dinner staying in the hotel who commutted those 15km of hilly muddy dirt i was looking at for the next day they inspired confidence head to bed start to drift off then i heard the buzzing feeling the whisps jump up lights on cockroaches everywhere huge fuckers sperg the fuck out ran out to the desk guy itsa big courtyard with a fully gates door to keep fucker out little staff house hy the gate and demanded another room 15 year old kid informs me its full demand my money back he doesnt have the lock boss will be back in the morning its pouring out probably about 11pm tell him fuck it open the gate im not staying here load up the bags and rode off as he heads into the room shaking a can of aersolized insecticide    i went to the only other inn in town that i knew of banged on the door till the guy opened practically beg mercy he takes pity leads me up to my room i sit on the bed recounting how fucked up that situation was he sits down bext to me put his hand on my thigh and reassures me and gives me this queer little giggle no thanks bro stand up take out the money he leaves
  went to bali cause had money and was bored i am an experienced traveler found myself overwhelmed by the general shittyness of my life crying in some shitty hotel room in kuta beach on new years eve while the coverband from hell played for hours and hours next door
    locked the fucking door and huddled with an open knife under the pillow while blowing 3/4 of my data plan on old westerns to help me fall asleep grab a couple hours and split at the crack of dawn rain had stopped riding was technical but i went slow and it was fine resolve to fet the fuck out of guatemala and spend the next four hours with thag singular focus in mind had made it and was so overjoyed at having gotten out of guatemala that i try to over take an suv racing me on a dirt diversado and nail an 8 inch asphalt shoulder merging back on to the road rim looks great by christ get to the hotel oil all over boots forks blown happy fucking birthday it was a low night just wanted to complete the objective the focus was intense the story that follows the mad dash to villahermosa riding shotgun with the mad grua man is one of my favorites tho    and frankly the feeling youre talking about that sort of desperation that didnt even hit until three days later the time when i called her when wed agreed to talk and she didnt pick up
  goddamn anon thats fucking crazy south america just sounds wild
  haha amazing hotel california cover
  fuck reminds me of vietnam even though central america must have been way harder    i went down on my first day of riding trying to do the whole hanoi to saigon meme went into a low slide after coming down a steep mountain gravel road bike landed on top of my foot and the angle i laid it down at had me pinned to the ground i had a bigger bike also not one of the 100cc honda wins most people rode a lone 5 year old picking mushrooms on the side of the road saw it all happen and i yelled at her to help as if she could do anything lol but that scared her off and she ran away the pain in my foot was getting bad and i was imagining the worst and pictured having to ride down this mountain while engine breaking shifting gears with the bone sticking out of my leg i was able to shift my body enough like i was doing a sit up and lift the bike just enough to pull my foot off the crank case i look at my foot and nothing is wrong and was able to make it to this random fucking container hostel in the middle of the jungle central america will come one day but i know everyday will be an unimaginable challenge
  of course all the classics alice who the fuck is alice etc
how long does it take for you guys to start missing home    i remember back when i was an antisocial neet i took a 1 month trip to a distant country i missed home a lot when i got home i practically hugged my desktop pc and i was just so happy to see my bed and things     these days im a normal functioning member of society so when i go away all summer for 3 months and come home and i just dont feel that great to be back back to the drugery and grind     im not sure i ever miss home anymore i just kind of want to keep travelling forever
    this is while il never travel by motorbike
  never lol how old are you    ive lived away from my home country for the past decade i dont miss it at all these days home is where my bed is
  dont be a pussy
  youre missing out pussy
  never i pretty much hate canada miss my senpai of course but one night back with my friends and thats enough theyre better when you dont have to be around them much
    retarded wannabe manly men faggots i literally race motorcycles every weekend and never drive it on the road its idiotic imagine thinking youre hardcore because you cruise on the freeway at 80 mph and hit the twisties once in a while lol getting rearended twice and t boned twice since i started riding at 16 is enough for me to resize that motorcycles should not be ridden in the same road as other vehicles
  when i got home i practically hugged my desktop pc
  yes usually happens when im shitting my guts out on a toilet somewhere in vang vieng
  damn i loved athens the locals were nice to me sorry bout that anon
    cool pic dude    oddly i feel the oppositedont really like travelling any other way airports suck buses suck cars are just as bad as buses    nope moto travel for me fuck i doubt i would have even made it the 4 years i did at my office job if i didnt have the screaming death race splitting bay area traffic at maximum speed to look forward to every morning and evening    things are quieter now though work from home the 10 day japan moto trip this last sep was fun thomade it to lots of places i probably wouldnt have gone with a car
i often get travel fatigue but not as severe as other posts on here if i get travel fatigue i just need a few hours on my bed mindlessly looking at memes and chatting to ppl back home then im good    once though in budapest i got sold some dodgy mdma and ended up going completely crazy this polish bus driver who was driving us round said i was an in the closet gay and for the next 12 hours while i was waiting for the drugs to wear off i was on my hostel bed eyes wide open questioning my sexuality i couldnt take it anymore and was going crazy so i messaged my buddy in another room and practically begged him to get up and calm me down he had taken the same stuff as me and was also freaking out lol but about different stuff then i finally got to sleep and all was good     worst night of my life lol but 3 years later im still pretty sure im not gay
  only once and fortunately only for a short bit this is kind of long and nothing was really bad just a lot of really small things adding up to get to a moment of i put up with all that shit for this    my second long trip to japan first time in the summer  before i even leave night before flight departs hear my phone buzz right after i went to bed  my flight from atlanta to chicago was cancelled  all remaining aa flights capable of getting me to chicago in time for my flight to narita were instantly booked  had to spend an hour of sleep time finding alternates and talking on the phone with aa to get rebooked to keep my travel plans intact  other than having to wake up earlier and losing business class seat on the domestic part of the trip because now im connecting through la instead of chicago flights are uneventful  land in narita barely feeling excited only tired  first night is in kanazawa so i still have to take a train into tokyo then another train an hour later to kanazawa getting there around 11pm  it was hot during the afternoon in tokyo and its somehow even fucking hotter in kanazawa  reach ryokan after 2km walk check in and immediately crash  worst sleep of my life since absolutely 0 padding on the futon  fml im stuck with this for four more nights  at breakfast next morning see news saying 3840c temps  for entirety of my stay in the city i am emptying vending machines of their water bottles to stay hydrated and breaking my back on the futon feeling absolutely dead during the day  realized i booked about half my nights for the trip in ryokans with a futon no bed options    after night 2 in kanazawa i was very close to saying fuck it going home after i finish my nights in tokyo things improved a lot though since after kanazawa i had 6 nights in actual beds and matsumoto was a bit cooler really everything improved a ton after i left tokyo for tohoku
  i have a work trip to romania coming up and ive been dreading it for months so yeah hopefully it will exceed my already rockbottom expectations
  i started riding at 16 also and never stopped because im not a pussy
  3 years later im still pretty sure im not gay  sure thing bby

prostitution is legal in turkey  buying and taking illegal drugs is depenalised in turkey  so has any of you taken drugs or fucked a prostitute in turkey protips please
  prostitution is legal in turkey  buying and taking illegal drugs is depenalised in turkey    source    i remember reading a story in the news about how an angry mob destroyed a cafe because some hipsters were drinking beer and listening to radiohead     cant believe this is the same as the country you are talking about
  some hipsters were drinking beer and listening to radiohead  whats the problem with that the fact that people have taken to listening to radiohead ironically is a sign of the end times
  i fucking wish i got a blowjob on my first date
yes prostitution is legal in turkey there are legal brothels you can find in every major cities there are two brothel streets in istanbul for example and there are streets that you can find street hookers as well technically only brothels are legal but officers dont bother those streets hookers    buying and taking illegal drugs is depenalised in turkey  thats not happening but you can drink alcohol on the streets thats something new for burgers     t turk
  what it costs
  that image  the biggest fool is the man on the left prolly not what the author intended
  i dont know exact prices but probably around 2025 usd until you cum
    i was under the impression that turkish brothels located within designated red light areas are for turkish nationals only i vaguely remember reading that there are police or security personnel outside such tolerance zones who are specifically tasked with checking the ids for anyone wishing to enter
  you can drink alcohol on the streets thats something new for burgers  lol its so true    moved to asia now i can buy a beer in a convenience store and walk around enjoying the day and drinking it without getting arrested freedom
  american here ive never had this problem must be a big city retard problem
  i dont know exact prices  can you ask them for me
  whats the price for a whore a whore in turkey    in thailand i was spending 2000 baht on average 66 for having her the whole night
  its not only for turkish citizens you can go in       it depends on whore independent girls are more pretty so they are more expensive there are russian ukrainian hookers and there are gypsy hookers as well all have different prices    cheapest whores are located in legal brothels prices around 20 usd for 1 time fucking
  where will you be this month we can meet  t op
  t turk    we can meet  t op  and that was the story of how op was got behead
  big city retard here it is
    sometime bible belter here its a problem everywhere down south
are there any thoughts about france mates
  eiflee tower is really cool to go check out
  funny how ive drunk a smoothie up there once
would be really nice if it wasnt for the french people best part of the country are the mediterranean coast and normandy
extremely overrated but extremely pleasant without expectations
paris paris is no longer paris
  paris a shithole go to spain if you really want a euro vacation spains kinda fucked too but the food and overall mood is better at least in barcelona madrid is kinda meh
  after the parisien the mediteranean people are second most hated
  maybe its from limited interactions but i love the french very direct they have no problem with sitting silence masters of the art of drinking coffee and smoking cigs while starting at nothing and everything good banter when needed delicious food excellent taste in boats
    just went there a few weeks ago to be fair we just did the touristy stuff eiffel tower louvre shit like that so that may paint a different picture than someone who actually lives there    we did not see niggers swarming all over the metro and we used it several times however there are niggers swarming all around the eiffel tower literally thousands of them laying out blankets in the sidewalk full of cheap souvenirs seriously like every 10 feet for several blocks around the tower in every direction     we did not experience parisians being snooty to english speaking americans without exception every waiter employee etc we dealt with was pleasant spoke english and was happy to do so even when i attempted to speak french in most cases they spoke english by default and i never even had a chance to attempt to speak french
  true ive also heard something about more scammers around the streets in spain but is this actually for real these days
planning to head out for marsillés in april i might just go dig up some hoes by then
  too much refugees coming into the country which is not so good for the economy
    we ameriburgers know that feel the only difference is we get called racist bigots when we say it
  delete this
    paris has cool museums and sights but you will have to deal with all the bullshit that people say its just a matter of if you think its worth it i think it is but thats just me     outside of paris though france is lovely normandy especially was relatively nigger free and the people were very very nice
a lot of people dont know this but france was actually originally made out of croissants only after joining the eu it had to be rebuild as a whole in accordance with a eu directive on noncroissant buildings
  especially whatever trump is doing right now is best for us anyways
    so what just because muslim refugees comes into america doesnt mean that you guys have to complain about it this much about it duh plus look at these muslim bitches in the photo
frenchman here  these   are correct    the problem with the best tourist places ex  le louvre is that they are incredibly crowded french in general and parisians in particular are getting better at english but were still pretty bad overall
    i rest my case other countries are allowed to complain about refugees but not america
    why i gave an honest assessment of what we saw and experienced in paris
  because /trv/ crybabies love to complain about muh rude french people they may have a hard time to cope with your post you should delete your post to protect them
    ah     we were told that everyone in paris is rude but in the smaller towns they are nicer interestingly the one stereotypical englishhating rude french waitress we encountered on our whole trip wasnt actually in paris it was in honfleur
  true well america wasnt meant to be a liberaltard country anyways so its a good thing
  ah   we were told that everyone in paris is rude but in the smaller towns they are nicer interestingly the one stereotypical englishhating rude french waitress we encountered on our whole trip wasnt actually in paris it was in honfleurwell were just making a point thats all the fact is that a lot of immigrants and refugees nowadays have been taking over half of the us health cares economy and education plus not to mention that even the housing prices have all gone up overtime yet its more crazy enough to know that our taxe money are especially going to these people and not to ourselves oh and btw fuck the halifax regional police officers here for bullying and making me cry too
   vüddles
  watch out for acid attacks
  the problem with the best tourist places ex  le louvre is that they are incredibly crowded    dont try and visit in the middle of july maybe then  ive been to the louvre in february and just had to waltz in there absolutely no wait line
  is march a good time in terms of crowds im probably going to paris and lyon in early march right now were planning on going to see a bunch of churches the roman theater in lyon the conciergerie the catacombs versailles and of course the louvre about 15 days in lyon and about 3 days in paris the rest of the trip will be spent in non touristy parts of switzerland probably in between the two french cities because i dont enjoy large crowds or panhandlers
  march should also be low season for tourists enjoy your time in france
  acid attack  in france  its a paki thing you stupid /pol/nigger      take a walk along the coast and go hiking to the calanques its pretty great
  well yeah i didnt thought of pointing that out but thats absolutely true
  thoughts about france  marseilles is better than paris
  agreed and less crimes as well
  muh dick  ngger

  is it true that people pee in the streets
  there are almost no refugees in france though most of the non whites in france came in the 60s/70s      march is ok just dont come in the summer
  some street corners/metro stations smell like piss but thats mostly in the poor areas the center of paris and the rich areas are very clean   the biggest problem in terms of hygiene in paris is dog shit especially in the grass   the streets obviously dont look like an indian railroad but still be careful
  around downtown yes but theres not that much around the suburbs however
  well just in indian traditional ways that is

why does every france thread get swarmed by /pol/tards who obviously have never been to the country
sup my dudes  flyin to berlin in 2 days   just wonderin if any local could recommend me some places to have dinner and drinks  far from touristic places    any recommendation would be appreciated
heading to dubai soon any advice and things to do
skydiveif youre on a tighter budget you can free fall off the burj khalifa
  heading to dubai soon   dont  any advice and things to do  yes nothing   the uae no the entire arab gulf for that matter should be wiped out total ethnic cleansing  its a disgrace these shitskins sit in their ivory towers with impunity drive luxury cars while the fuck us over on oil why do they deserve any of it theyre stupid low iq ive met a few of them and theyre dumb as rocks even if you look at the language its barbaric and literally uncomplex just like their minds  they have no right to exist i refuse to set foot in their arid lands and give them any tourist money whatsoever all that oil could be taken over by a western power and used for her citizens but it isnt because we are weak
  yeah on a tight budget
  bump
  what sort of things do you like to do    everybody is going to want to take you to the palm island thing  resist that from the ground it is just buildings on an island nothing particular to see and nothing to do    hang out around the base of burj khalifa for people watching and the dancing fountain shit while there might as well poke around in the big ass mall    do you do water activities  kite surfing over at jumeirah beach is good    if your budget allows go spend a night in a tent in the wildlife preserve see oryxes and shit being in the desert at night is reasonably cool    worlds longest zipline would be worth trying    i enjoyed skiing in the not quite as big ass mall it is obviously not great skiing but the incongruity of it is fun    there are plenty of good indian lebanese etc restaurants and seafood places    the museum in the old fort is only going to take about an hour but is the only place ive found with any sense of the historic dubai    have not found an actual traditional suq there so far only touristedup ones    big thing is you have to get into the right headspace its a kitschyass place you have to get in the mood to enjoy that sort of stuff
  have not tried this but if you have somebody to do it with you it might be fun    
  this guy is right dubai has no cultural value if you must go then you might try an arabian adevtures desert excursion theyll take you out in land cruisers and drive around sand dunes and stuff still better to just skip the uae altogether     unless you need to fly ek their business class on the a380 is decent and often quite convenient
  hell their steerage on a 380 is not bad    that really is a comfie plane    sorry you did not enjoy dubai to each his own
ever notice every faggot going to dubai never checks if theres already a going to dubai thread  unironically dont even bother going to that desert shithole and kys
  thank you
planning on doing this drive in the span of a day leaving in the morning any worthwhile detours/stopoffs so far i have      the grand mosque in aksaray   the mevlana museum in konya  i want to make a nature stop of some sort between konya and antalya the terrain looks nice there but i have no specifics    also turkey general
isis training camps
im going to be out in flagstaff for a week anyone whos been have any recommended spots to go to in between snowboarding at the snow bowl
  depends do you drink stick near the tracks and youll be fine flagstaff is a stupidly small niche town
also if anyone wants to meet up im down
  depends do you drink  yeah i love a good scotch whiskey rum or coffee
  lumber yard brewing good hot sauce brew their own shit    altitudes bar does good shotslike 2 dollars during every train which is like 3 or 4 every 5 minutes    lowell observatory is neat    iirc there is a bus to the meteor crater dont think you can go in the volcano caves in winter though
  sweet thanks
  meteor crater is a rare opportunity that most people dont have a remote chance of seeing     the little museum is a must if youre somewhat into space
honestly flagstaff fucking sucks and is a major letdown the town is small and full of socialist college kids with dyed hair and drunk navajos its good to visit for one day and after that there is nothing to do
  i think i agree with this unless youre into the outdoors and its not winter     captcha mountains or hills
  flagstaff aint the best thing but a week will let you do anything you could think of around it a bus to sedona is cheap and a good day trip there is enough with snow to keep you interested for a week to see virtually everything
alright /trv/ i am going to sri lanka probably next march for a little short of 3 weeks so far i was reading a bit about the place and everything but id like to have some firsthand experience from people who have been there or living there wed like to travel around the country with our backpacks and naturally not being ripped of completely by all the tourist traps which there certainly are what to see what to definitively avoid i would like to have at least couple of beach days preferably at the end of the journey to wind down
not sure what youre referring to by tourist trap all the ancient ruins are expensive but worth it id have paid twice as much to see pollonaruwa and anuradhapura i recommend renting a bicycle to tour around those places as theyre huge and theres cool ruined stuff out on the fringes where the fat tourists dont go  i found the tea plantations to be very disappointing people talk about them like theyre beautiful pastoral landscapes but all i could think about was the fact that 100 years ago this was one of the most biodiverse rainforests on earth and now its a boring monoculture touring a tea factory was cool though and the tamil slaves who work on the plantations were genuinely cool bros   there are probably a million great beach areas but i had fun relaxing at mirissa in the far south good for whalewatching eating freshcaught fish and drinking lion porter on the beach nearby weligama is the goto place for surfing if thats your thing
oh and get to sigiriya early it opens at 7am iirc and about an hour after that the german pensioners start pouring in by the busload getting there at opening time will allow you some solitude to enjoy the monkeys and the mist dont miss nearby dambullah temple
      thanks already for the tips tourist traps are for me places where you pay a lot and you get nothing out of it except anger of having paid too much hows the travel inside the country i havent read anything about safety concerns so i guess with common sense youd be fine no
  train travel is the way to go theres no better way to see the natural beauty of the country we took buses a few times encountered a few shenanigans with the bushustlers  for example lying about how soon they were departing just so wed buy the ticket tuktuk drivers can be really annoying but be nice to them cause they live shitty lives they will rip you off if they can though ask at your hotel how much you should pay for a tuktuk ride to the local attractions   tuktuk tours are a good thing to do on our sigiriya day we paid a driver to stay with us the entire day and take us around local attractions we did the same thing around weligama and our guy drove us to all kinds of fun activities like a snake petting zoo and local product factories these tend to operate on a pay what you think is fair plus petrol basis
that place rocks
can anyone tell me why restaurants are so hard to find in sri lanka outside of the big cities and tourist hotspots i really struggled to find anywhere to eat is it just not part of their culture
  i think its because a lot of restaurants these days have been closed down due to inspectiona lately
  is it just not part of their culture  yes its similar in india and bangladesh too
  what to see  sigiriya rock expensive but worth it in my opinion  pidurangala rock  adams peak  knuckles range  bahiravokanda vihara buddha statue  dambulla cave temple  just exploring the city colombo  kandy are surprisingly comfy    what to definitively avoid  the marketplace in kandy its a massive clusterfuck that i wouldnt wish on anybody plus most of their goods are more useful to locals than foreigners  the temple of the sacred tooth relic its not a bad sight by any means but its just expensive in terms of pricetoenjoyment ratio  any seafoodbased street food this may not always be readily obvious i got diarrhea from fish samosas so just ask if youre not sure dont avoid all street food because otherwise youll miss out on a lot of sri lankan culture short eats kottu roti etc  wild animals be extra diligent ive seen monkeys stealing shit from people many times also if youre in the sigiriya area apparently wild elephants can come out at night and theyre not friendly
  ive seen monkeys stealing shit from people many times  heres a story for you  go to sri lanka with qtgf  buy her an engagement ring made from local sapphire  carry it in plastic bag so she wont suspect  go to dambulla temple that same day  sacred monkeys everywhere  sacred monkey sees bag  sacred monkey thinks food  sacred monkey steals ring  i chase after monkey desecrating holy temple by yelling fuck repeatedly  i get it back but surprise is ruined for fiancee  asian tourists taking photographs all the while
  avoid beggars with fucked up legs cause theyll try and put a curse on you and your bloodline for eternity
go to pidurangela instead of sigiriya take the train instead of the bus when possible colombo is a much cooler place than kandy better food a bit less hassle from tuk tuk drivers and kandy is generally a boring touristy place however you should consider staying on the outskirts of kandy in the mountains i had a cheap private room with a superb view of the mountains also make sure to visit the botanical gardens near kandy you can take the bus at least do it on the way back to the city as all the busses go there so finding the right bus isnt a problem and its way cheaper than a tuk tuk    the food is for the most part shitty and generally southern india is a better though different place imo less hassle cheaper and more raw in sri lanka i felt like a walking atm
  trains are very high on my list i definitively want to take trains whenever i can i read on the ella  kendy route is that something you did       freaking monkeys are a hassle that i learned on some other trips but thanks especially for the seafood tip       gotcha      do you have a recommendation at hand
my suggestion is that you could travel around colombo and find lots of restaurants with great cuisines and bars mostly around the downtown vacinitys
  go to pidurangela instead of sigiriya  i would honestly recommend both if youre not strapped for cash the most common criticism i hear of sigiriya is the pricing if money is an issue then yeah stick to pidurangala but otherwise do both if you can afford it i dont regret it one bit    take the train instead of the bus when possible  i assume you mean long distance charter buses but man public city buses are a fucking nightmare them shits are probably the fastest thing on the road when passengers want to get off they dont really stop they just slow down ever so slightly and the passengers are expected to jump off i saw one guy jump out and his feet were skidding/shuffling on the ground like some cartoon character    colombo is a much cooler place than kandy  i dont know if i fully agree with you but colombo is pretty fucking cool i was expecting india 20 but no it was actually pretty welldeveloped    the food is for the most part shitty  thats unfortunate i suppose i guess not everyone can like the same things but i hope anyone else reading this isnt discouraged by this sri lankan cuisine actually ended up being one of my favorites ultimately you gotta see for yourself
regarding cuisine first of all you cant say anything negative about short eats theres such a wide variety and theyre all not only tasty but also fun and satisfying in some restaurants they just bring a huge platter of short eats to the table and you just pay for the ones you eat 10/10 lunch  also i went to a fancy restaurant in colombo and it was sublime all the traditional elements of local cuisine like coconut hoppers done to a 5star standard i paid like 20  but the grilled snapper i had in mirissa stands out as one of the best meals ive had sitting on the beach there are rowboats packed with ice and the days catch and you point to the fish you want and the hotel will grill it for you then and there
    the train that goes from kandy to colombo is actually quite fun and youll likely garner a lot of attention just by being there people are extra friendly in sri lanka
  you cant say anything negative about short eats theres such a wide variety and theyre all not only tasty but also fun and satisfying  dude fucking this    i once bought samosas from a vendor expecting them to be regular ol samosas that you can find literally anywhere in the world nope they had poached quail eggs inside
  poached quail eggs inside  and did they tasted great overall or were the regular ones the best
  i liked them more than the regular ones actually
  well not bad still i actually would love to give these a try someday as well
  hire a boater to take you to a remote island with uncontacted peoples on it
  i hope people will show the sri lankans how fucking ridiculous the price for sigiriya is by staying away it just added to the feeling i had of being a walking atm    yeah i mean intercity busses fuck being crammed into a seat that is way too small next to a fat lady youre right about the insanity of the busses but generally i found that they will make a full stop for tourists    what did you like about kandy it was touristic as fuck people hassling you or trying to scam you everywhere temple of the tooth is overrated walking around the lake was nice and so was the botanical gardens and the mountains around the city     what did you like so much about the food i will admit that i didnt try as muxh seafood as i should have but the dhals and curries were bland and virtually none of them were better than any meal ive had in india tried kottu twice one time it was pretty tasty the other time it was terrible
  how fucking ridiculous the price for sigiriya is  dude its only 30 for sigiriya and 25 for the other two ancient cities you dont think thats a fair price to see some of the most impressive ruins in asia sure everything in sea is supposed to be cheap but dont let yourself get spoiled   if sigiriya were in europe youd consider that a great deal it costs that much to get into the prado in madrid or the halfassed science museum in my home city   you even get to see cave paintings of topless women well worth it in my opinion
  if sigiriya were in europe youd consider that a great deal it costs that much to get into the prado in madrid or the halfassed science museum in my home city  not really usually entry fees in europe are in 1015 euro range prado is 15 euro btw
curious about going to sri lanka this winter to surf for a while how abrasive are touts and people trying to rip you off there any scams to avoid
  in my experience touts there are on par with all the worst countries like morocco and vietnam i never met any scammers though and the surf towns were slightly more chilled out
galle old town and fort is comfy as fuck i loved sri lanka all the good bits of india without half of the bad
    definitely a better texture also
found the ruins a complete ripoff and not worth it in the slightest maybe im spoilt living in europe but found them very disappointing    food was very poor as well and found it difficult to find decent restaurants that served local cuisine and not poor western imitations    trains were dangerously overcrowded so get first or second class reserved or dont bother    natural scenery is fantastic dont waste your time with towns and cities
we are landing at 9 am in cmb and wanna stay the night in colombo or negombo before we leave by tuktuk is colombo really the shithole that i read everywhere
  no i dont think its fair lots of good and cheaper stuff to see in europe made me feel like a walking atm a feeling i had a lot while there       good post i know that im an idiot for even trying to order a burger outside of fast food places but i had a burger that was so disgusting that i still cant even think about it without gagging    trains are cool though they always gave me a 2nd class reserved seat and then you just go hang out the door for the whole trip
  colombo is a cool city negombo is comfy with some decent food options where will you go to by tuk tuk public transportation is cheaper and you dont have to speak to some idiot trying to get more money out of you    to people who keep talking about india as if its an unbearable shithole either you should stop travelling outside of the first world if you cant handle some weird smells or a bit of dysfunction or you need to get out of rajasthan
sri lankan here check r/srilanka they have a travel guide     try all the food especially rice and curry hoppers and kottu eat from roadside boutiques called kades also short eats    i am a colombar so i love colombo it has everything you need when it comes to gastronomic experiences try sri lankan food at upalis beware of 24 hour eateries as they compromise on hygiene     negotiate tuk tuk prices before hand i am not aware about current prices but a few years back a kilometer cost like 50 bucks     wear longs when visiting religious sites check out mirissa galle fort and hikkaduwa but be warned that they are very touristy hill country is a must too  check out nuwara eliya and kandy if you like nature there are a ton of reserves    check out the north central ancient cities of anuradhapura pollonaruwa and sigiriya for ruins and a taste of sri lankan history the east coast has trinco and passikudah which are beautiful coastal resorts    the north was battered by a brutal war which waged for 26 years however i have heard tourism there is booming as they are pumping money to develop it so please check it out tamils who are in the north have a different culture so it will be a nice contrast to the south which is predominantly sinhalese    beware of people who ask you too much questions as they will try and solicit like people asking if you want a tour or what not if they charge something reasonable please go for it as you are helping someone out too but sometimes they have very high rates always ask for the price of anything    anyways have fun anon i will be monitoring this chat in case you need suggestions
maybe this is an isolated incident but the tipping culture with sri lankan tuktuks  taxis is weird    say that a ride costs 300 rupees you arrive at your destination and you think the driver did a good job so you give him 500 instead despite having obviously given him a higher than agreed amount the driver will still have the audacity to ask you for a tip they ask for a little extra every time without fail like theyre on autopilot    i advise anyone riding tuktuks/taxis to consider paying them the exact amount first then based on the drivers service  attitude tip them accordingly or dont bother with the archaic tipping system at all if you have the balls
  lol thats a hefty tip a 200 rs tip is insignificant for you but thats like two meals in sri lanka especially considering a rs 300 ride is like 15 minutes anything more than 50 is considered too much by my standards if they took you around for an hour that is kinda ok but still these drivers are the laziest mofos and have their three wheel mafias sri lankans dont encourage this livelihood by rewarding them
  nah colombo isnt a shithole it has its own vibe like any big city compare nyc to cape cod it doesnt have much scenic and natural attractions but it is where everything is happening and lively
    op here    thanks for everyone for the your ideas and opinions luckily i am not that cash strapped that i have to skip a 30 usd attraction but i hate nothing more than being cheated on i dont have a problem negotiating prices and haggle over 2 pennies if i have to so as a rule of thumb what is a fair price for lets say a km with a tuk tuk or something when you said 50 bucks it means 50 local currency    our route would be for now landing in cmbnegombo up to anarudhapura down to kandy then i would like the scenic train to galle and afterwards maybe a trek tips anyone and i would like to spend at least 34 nights at the beach to wind down we have in total around 25 weeks without travel days
    this     theres so much cool shit in india and there are very very few touts outside a handful of popular towns and cities i cannot comprehend why people who cant stand some jostling and dirt would ever even want to visit india
    yes lkr 4050 is the norm per km refer the article below to understand the taxi scene in sl if i were you i would take google maps and find the distance first before the journey tuk tuk drivers can be annoying and stubborn but they are getting desperate so if you are within that ball park you should be good you should also be confident and not act like you are a first timer when negotiating    i think ella is pretty good for trekking i have heard good things about meemure too also bandarawela        i also suggest you check this website for restaurants and other things to try    yamulk    they list restaurant reviews of famous restaurants and the blogs are quite informative wannabe sri lankan buzzfeed
    thank you mate that sounds quite cool i suppose sri lanka is cash country
    not necessarily for big establishments shops and restaurants the roadside shops and eateries are cash only they usually indicate on the door if they accept cards or not but the best give away is that if the place looks good crowded or airconditioned most likely it accepts card
just landed in sri lanka going to be seeing the places close to colombo the next few days
    ive managed to pay by credit card at a small local restaurant in colombo it really looked like a whole lot of nothing but they took my foreign visa credit card just fine    ive even managed to use my credit card at a small 3bedroom bb in sigiriya this was actually some random familys home in the middle of the jungle and even there they accepted credit cards in contrast ive stayed in genuine hotels in major cities that were cashonly    sri lanka is full of weird surprises
sri lanka is quite exotic i definitely recommend hikkaduwa  you can see giant sea turtles there that come to the beach sigiriya is cool but do the hill opposite to it its waaaa y cheaper and offers the same view    definitely do the elephant safari i have never seen so many elephants in one place than in sri lanka also they have these full moon festivals which are a unique experience ask the locals if there are some festivals happening soon    for me food was good i loved the seafood someone mentioned a grillled red snapper that was the best fish i ever had and i live close to the mediterranean but after a week the food got boring so i needed something western to break the monotomy then i was good again    ella to kandy is a must nature and wildlife all over sri lanka is just fantastic the fruit is delicious as fuck    dont eat meat chicken is fine but the rest is terrible its low quality and tastes like cardboard also its very hard to get any liquor due to it being buddhist you can find beer but anything stronger is very very hard to come across especially outside of biog cities
  anything stronger is very very hard to come across  i didnt have much trouble finding arrak in mediumsized towns and lion stout is sold everywhere and itll fuck you up as well as any hard liquor
  hikkaduwa  
  dont eat meat  dont have to tell me twice many places dont always remove the bones before chopping the meat so you might find bone fragments in your dish    my first kottu roti was a challenging experience because i had to keep spitting out tiny broken chicken bones my second kottu roti experience was very enjoyable because i ordered it vegetarian
  its very hard to get any liquor  my sentiments are similar    oddly enough marijuana seemed pretty easy to find i wasnt even actively looking for it random guys would just come up to me and ask me if i want to purchase any ganja i cant vouch for the price or the quality because 1 i dont smoke and 2 i somewhat had a suspicion that these guys mightve been undercover cops
  oddly enough marijuana seemed pretty easy to find i wasnt even actively looking for it random guys would just come up to me and ask me if i want to purchase any ganja i cant vouch for the price or the quality because 1 i dont smoke and 2 i somewhat had a suspicion that these guys mightve been undercover cops    lol dude dont do it especially kg kerala ganja shit is like laced with insect repellent shit causes brain damage also note that moonship known as kasippu is brewed in outside barrels and most of the time snakes fall into them and drown stay away from drugs in sl unless you want to get brain damage or robbed
    in my experience from many years back sri lanka was the worst drug destination ever fluffy and light buds that just seemed dried wrong and still were quite costly only ever had such bad weed in indonesia there was some charas available at an insane price that i never partook of
    looks like i didnt miss much then again i live in western canada so the bar was set pretty high if i were to ever try marijuana i think id rather do it at home where its legal as of a month ago  safer
op here can anyone recommend some place where you can get in touch with the wildlife there i dont mean this fucking ride an elephant animal torture things but something more ethical  in case this does exist
    yala wilpattu and udawalawe are the two main ones to sight leopards and elephants note that these safaris involve going in jeeps in trails which are paved so dont expect a lot of animals to be on the trails as too much traffic has taken its toll i like horton plains as the weather is great and it is very scenic not sure about the animal scene there but it has all the dairy farms so if you are into cute cows like me you might like it    i have a friend who started a new safari company called vanya safaris his photos seem legit so idk he might be good    avoid pinnawala as their elephant sanctuary has been in quite a bit of controversy for abusing them plus it is filled with tourists i believe there is whale and dolphin watching down south in kirinde and tangalle iirc benthota has boat safaris into mangroves which have quite a bit of bird life and there are quite a few turtle hatcheries in the area
  i came back from horton plains literally minutes ago nice nature but didnt see animals leopards are elusive and rare
    well i wonder how much worth is it just being driven around in jeeps that might be then a bit of a disappointment but maybe i am expecting it to be more like a safari in namibia or rsa
  i liked tea plantation landscape in nuarva elija or something like this
  im not american so i dont tip
  i havent been to africa so idk i am also not into wildlife so it is not my cup of tea however i have been on one and it can be fun when you are in an exposed jeep with a wreckless driver the more you spend the more likely you are going to have a better experience and likely to sight animals you should also remember that sl doesnt have a savannah like landscape with a full field of view the safari i went on had only a handful of such scenes when like 70 of the ride was through roads surrounded by foliage     however i personally dont think it is worth to spend like 20 dollars to be covered in dust only to see some deer that being said i was unlucky the people who went ahead of me on a different road said they did spot leopard 20 dollars is a lot of food in sl and being a foodie id rather spend it on food when i know there will be 0 disappointment
  i went there around 1000 am    i had to deal with surprisingly wellbehaved chinese tourists they werent perfect but they were a hell of a lot better than the chinese tourists youd typically see in a city    i also encountered several russian tourists who needed help with their cameras and a group of british college students obsessed with stranger things
  20 dollars of food in sri lanka will be 100 disappointing    really struggled to get any kind of good quality local food kottu was fine found the curries pretty poor to be honest and hoppers were very meh can only assume its americans and europeans that arent use to good quality curry that are raving    disappointing as food in india was very good    interested to hear if anyone in here found anywhere that did streetfood or similar
    you have been unlucky with the spots you selected mate hoppers are meant to be eaten hot hot and there is a lot of variance when it comes to quality of hoppers as the price for roadside eateries is regulated by the govt so many skimp on the actual ingredients     of course you must be a meathead and we dont have skewers and bbqs on the street like in asia if you want to eat healthy sri lanka is the place as we dont load our streetfood with a ton of fat like in india    20 dollars of food is like 10 meals in sri lanka from like middle class eateries

okay lads  im indian and im graduating from uni next year my friend and i were originally planning to travel to north east india pic related once we graduate and that eventually changed into travelling the entirety of india  were both fond of travelling but havent really vacationed for durations of more than 2 weeks   wed be starting from kerala where my friends house is  weve planned on visiting the following regions for now  kerala karnataka maharashtra its capital is mumbai goa gujarat not entirely sure about this one yet rajasthan punjab himachal pradesh one of our friends lives here jk uttarakhand and the entirety of north east india  if theres any other states that are worth visiting then please suggest that as well also if its possible wed be down to visiting bhutan and nepal since india has open borders with both of those countries  were open to renting motorbikes to traverse certain regions would like to keep planes to a minimum  how would we go along planning this trip how long do you think the trip would last how much would it roughly cost    i know theres an anon here whos like an expert on india and theres others whove travelled to india as well so id love any sort of advice or suggestions   thanks in advance    ps between the two of us we can speak fluently in english hindi and malayalam i can somewhat speak and understand marathi since i was born and brought up in mumbai
  india is huge with ordinary infrastructure that trip would need to be at least 6 months i would pick a few areas and do them in more detail i recommend rajasthan and kerala and definitely nepal long distances in 3rd world countries is always hazardous on motorbikes
  im thinking of travelling via buses and trains for the most part motorcycle travel will be limited to only traversing certain regions certain north east states ladakh himachal pradesh maybe kerala because renting one for the entirety of the trip would be quite inconvenient for the following reasons   1 unnecessary expense  not just the cost of renting it everyday but also the expenses of paying for the fuel petrol prices are at a record high in india rn as well as for the maintainence and repairs which will be plenty considering the road quality of most roads except for interstate highways freeways and national highways are quite poor  2 it would take much more longer and be more physically tiring than just riding public transit  3 most importantly if we do end up renting one and riding it throughout we have to also return it back imagine driving back from the north east to kerala just to return the bikes you rented it would be seriously taxing as fuck    i recommend rajasthan kerala and definitely nepal  any specific places youd recommend here

how clean is india in 2018 same as 2010
  yes

  1 more year and it will become superpower  just wait and watch you filthy gaijin  namaste
  i am a canadian who loves india and loves indians it is one of my favourite places to go because i love comedy india is a land of absolute morons to the level of complete hilarity everyone is so incompetent and the systems you have in place are so inefficient and futile it is absurd everything is done backwards and attempting to explain plain simple white logic to an indian can never compute i am sorry bro but there is no way that india can ever be a super power outside of creating the tools and technologies that the western world utilizes as a low cost because of pisspoor wages i am sorry to say it like this but just embrace your goofy comedic heritage just look at traffic look at electricity and plumbing systems look at the belief systems hinduism hilarious childrens stories that adults fully believe in you have a sweet country though but indian food is mostly terrible i hope this wasnt insulting
hello im a 22 y/o american student i need to kill some time this spring and summer and instead of working the same bullshit jobs in my hometown i would like to go somewhere else in my country or in a working holiday country like ireland what is the best website to find cool jobs that offer accommodations no indentured servitude wwoofing suggestions please   also general working abroad thread
  coolworks is pretty much the central hub for seasonal jobs in the us and some abroad  btw summer season in alaska is great its like a giant drunken sleep away camp with a season end bonus

  lots of museums
   rio has a pretty good variety of museums  of course not world class but interesting nontheless
   really known for food or parties so good to discover great unknown stuff    wat    i get that this is probably a troll post but ive long been under the impression that rio is an international party hub
how many time zones have you been in  in flight doesnt count
  20 or 21 crossed the oceans a couple times on cruise ships and theres a couple of spots where ive done half hours newfoundland nuka hiva
there was a thread on here that must have died about a week ago where a certain anon was talking about west africa more specifically mauritania i was looking into it more and i came across a really long freight train that goes from nouadhibou to zouerate that you can ride for free if you climb into one of the carts just wondered if anyone had done this    i also read about a ship graveyard in nouadhibou that sounds cool again anyone seen it and what other cool stuff is there to see i know about the geology of the country like the richat which is the main reason i want to check it out
also im gay i dont know if that makes a difference
  fuck off you mutt
  gay  anywhere in africa    some places are worse than others but understand that you could literally be given the death penalty in some places only go if youre 100 sure you can keep it hidden and dont fuck anybody
  op here i appreciate the concern but that was not me
  youll be lucky to make it out alive  mauritania is maximum shithole status
    the ship graveyard extends over a very large area you can take a taxi to it but its probably best to rent a driver for the day for maybe 100 you can also have them drive you down to nouakchott from nouadhibou because the ship graveyard extends down that way also the journey is like 7 hours long or some shit its a full day affair there are some decrepit ships just outside of nouadhibou which are really cool but the most famous ones are further south quite a ways away from nouadhibou    pic related turned out i was taking photos on military land so some soldiers radioed their superior who basically told us to fuck off past some point and take pictures in the other direction pretty cool about the whole thing actually    i have stories about the ore train and other shit too but i find that after i type up a long story the thread fucking dies instantly without any responses or appreciation so the worth it factor is pretty fucking low
  i have a specific question about the train although its not the main reason to do it part of the allure is watching the stars in the sahara at night and of course the landscape during the day however you have to wear sunglasses due to the dust wont that take a lot of the pleasure away    also were you ever worried about falling off it seems like the wagons are quite full and i suppose that its a bumpy ride
  do you have any pics from the train journey id love to hear some stories about the whole thing and i promise ill keep the thread alive also are there any interesting things in mauritania worth seeing that most people who go wouldnt know about
    i was looking forward to stars but got clouds the whole fucking way the landscape during the day was cool though and overall it was pretty awesome i never wore sunglasses it wasnt much of an issue desu the biggest issue was iron ore dust in your mouth breathing it in it was hard to get that wrap right theres no risk of falling of the train whatsoever    do the ride to nouadhibou for full wagons its better that way
    most stuff i saw was common info online the only thing i hadnt heard of were the barbershops wherever you go look for these theyre really cool with bright colors and handpainted signs that are quite interesting
  this is awesome i have so many questions so here goes  did you go alone  how long is the train journey  did you go both ways  is it worth doing the whole thing to/from zouerate  if you do the journey to nouadhibou whats the best way to get to choum/zouerate  when in choum/zouerate where did you stay  is the train from nouadhibou to choum/zouerate completely empty    also were you the guy in the other thread who mentioned hiring a camel for a week
which airline has the best looking flight attendants
any asian or arab airline that hires based on looks thats all of em cathay pacific have these tall han chinese the prettiest one i saw on the way back from asia recently though after 4 months in sea this qatar hired ladakhi tibetan was the hottest thing id seen in a long time about 175 tall asian mixed breed almost all asians that are freakishly tall are amazing    also ethiopian airlines are a wildcard they have some stunners
ethiopian hnnngh
  any asian or arab airline that hires based on looks thats all of em  dunno some of the girls on korean air looks kinda weird
  every asian airline has rice farmer looking women on them good bodies but extremely bad faces    honestly the best ones ive experienced were ryanair ironically its because they just pick women based on appearance and give them a couple of months of training and then put them in the plane for low pay they are literally hired with that prospect in mind from the start
im a recovering ethiopian bleaching addict ama
  aeroflot they still sack flight attendants if they put on too much weight/get too old    honestly the best ones ive experienced were ryanair ironically  flown with ryanair at least 50 times and id say theyre the worst maybe thats just with flights into and out of the uk though  flew vueling from porto to milan once and all the hostesses were attractive southern european women
apparently finnair hires their attendants on permanent contracts and now 80 of their cabin crew are 50yearold whales    why the fuck would a company do this to themselves
  i would really like to see this question asked on pol m8
anyone have experience with any mongolian airline young mongolian women have this weird mix of asian and caucasian looks with a rosycheeks complexion that just makes me go hnnnnnnnngggg      governmentenforced labor laws same reason american companies hire barely qualified semiilliterate blacks
iceland air   c   e   l   a   n   d       air
  ryanair  flybe  easyjet     in that order
      finnair have to do with what they have locally they do not want to tap into the scratchcards scratchcards pool of slav bimbos and finnish women themselves are busy studying and clever enough not to fall into the waitress in the sky trap     i assume finnair are relying on gov subsidies too so they cant just import long legged laotian women for looks finnairs edge is bringing nordics to asia faster and cheaper than anyone else and they do a very good job of hat      ba is another airline that only hires old women and old gay men they just wont cater to anyone nonbritish just look at the food they serve raisin filled sponge cakes covered in icing that has no taste yet still makes your teeth ache like youve downed a tablespoon of sugar
tfw you will never have an ethiopian qts nylon covered legs wrapped around you as she calls you a sex god in a flagrantly blasphemous statement  how does it feel /trv/ pretty bad huh  hnnnngh
is emirates really like this    i want the atomic blonde qt    
  how often do you larp on egyptian economic discussion boards
used to be malev combining beauty with sternness but they are no more
  yeah but still theyre the best looking girls in korea
  do not mention a demon by name lest he should here you and be summoned
  its not a larp in fact my ex was very angry when she found out not only about the bleaching but how prolific it was   i even managed to pull it off during the trump inauguration with all those pussy hat dykes swarming around
  raisin filled sponge cakes covered in icing
  epic xd
  i fly finnair a lot and you are greatly exaggerating have you ever flown with them what you described happens with many airlines but the worst ones by far are the ones from burgerland with finnair usually the head purser is in her/his 50s on long haul flights but there are plenty of younger ones as well    tldr you are full of shit and i dont know why you randomly picked out one airline which doesnt stand out one way or another in this aspect
  yeah this and wow air i love me some icelandic blondes
  mercy i fly ryanair 5x/month and 90 look like goblins guess im on the wrong flights
  dude weed lmao
  do you fly wizz
  shut the fuck up faggot unlike the shit tier airlines you have in muttia finnair actually offers their workers decent working conditions a permanent contract and good pay companies should treat their workers well just like finnair in the us nobody even wants to become a pilot because you are treated like a slave
  its not because youre treated like a slave its because the costs to even get to the point of getting hired is over 6figures our major airlines unfortunately dont have apprenticeship programs if youre a military aviator leaving the air force or navy however its easy to pop right over to a major airline and skip the regional airline bullshit
airlines with the ugly only hags as hostesses have the best service and the best prices
  the cost is around 6 figures for finnair too but after you are guaranteed a job  i mean you have shit salary and shit working conditions with little job security for new pilots in america
  also the best blowjobs
im always stunned by the bad nosejobs on korean airlines all of them otherwise they look good  mainland china seems to have the policy of stationing all model/god tier policemen and soldiers on the borders and airports no matter what armpit of a chinese city you are in you see the han peasant face in town and suddenly its all models when you get to the airport
  sometimes yeah theyre fine but dont measure up in the good looking stewardess stakes the very oldfashioned malev uniform helped and the fact it was not pink also helped
just don t expect any hot flight attendants on any us airline geez it like hire them on purpose to be nasty fugly   i was on a united flight dengeg and this f/a had thick ass coke bottle glasses and motor oil greasy black hair   its their fucking unions that allow then to look like slobs
this is far far from the best but indigo was a diamond in the rough not only are they based in india they are also a budget airline so they have two things working against them yet their attendants looked surprisingly not bad
  meh finnair is cutting back just like most other airlines due to pressure from low cost airlines the flight i took with them last month was mediocre the food in business was bad the stewardesses and the purser although older were the only good part of the flight completely professional and friendly then again im old enough to remember flights serving jumbo shrimp and filete mignon
  long haul or short haul finnair has really improved their food the last year or two and in business its always been quite good in my experience i actually prefer the food when leaving from helsinki as opposed to leaving from whatever asian destination
is air stewardess the most alpha position a stacey could ever dream of
is there anywhere to go in bahrain for good night or is it all hookers everywhere id like to know a place where i can roll in solo and have a chance of talking to different people and girls is that even realistic in bahrain from what ive seen its all working girls empty bars or bars with only dudes
  but arent clubs and whores haram
  get a passport you dumb flyover
  flyover  but im not american
in the us    is there any train service from san francisco to new york      with a bunch of friends were thinking of doing a road trip from ny to san fco and were trying to figure out how to return using another way that isnt by driving
flying
  yes but it takes like three days and it is much more expensive than flying
if you had spent just one minute googling it youd have gottn your answer but yes california zephyr from san fran to chicago and from there you can take another connection to ny probably isnt worth it if youve already road tripped the same route but it looks awesome and id love to do it myself one day
  it actually takes about 5 or 6 you have to shoot up to sfo then shoot over to chicago hop on another train to nyc its also kinda boring once you leave the rockies not cost effective at all and very eh on stop overs
  you go from sf to la la to chicago and then chicago to nyc    its expensive slow uncomfortable and just horrible
  burgers are individualists so they dont have as much trains a commie europeans have
  we have a shit load of train systems across the us we had a shit ton of rail pre 1950s the death of rail in the us was due because to air travel being far cheaper and easier for most not to mention the cost of cars and gas is far under that of most places in the world    cant imagine why anyone would want to do a 3 day train vs a 35 hour plane for a lower cost
fly and use the days saved to spend longer on the roadtrip over    yolo
long distance trains suck ass in america better off flying
  itll take you nearly a week on amtrak and would blow if you cant afford a sleeper cabin just fly it takes 4 hours
  fly    people underestimate the size of the us there is a train that does that route but it will take multiple days
  fuck this damn thread is nearly bringing tears to my eyes because of the memories  i had no cell phone service unless we had just left a train station there was no wifi and i had no books with me alone with my thoughts through miles and miles of corn surrounded by strange religious folk that stared at me    trains can be great if youre traveling on the east coast like between new york philadelphia and dc otherwise just forget it
  people underestimate the size of the us  the us isnt that big anon its like only slightly bigger than the mainland of eu or something though feel free to stroke your ego on how you need to overcompensate for just having shitty rail systems
  more than twice the surface area of the european union    whats the longest by distance plausible rail journey in the eu glasgow to athens lisbon to stockholm it might be interesting to compare
  yeah but its very easy to travel around all of europe without ever getting on a plane when it comes to the us only the coasts can be travelled via train
  group of countries with their own cultures and economies sets up a rail system to get around and it just happens to connect with other countries   states in the middle of nowhere with populations of only a few million people most of whom live in one or two cities or miles from anyone   i wonder why there isnt one especially when flying is easier/faster
  california texas florida and the dcboston corridor are all dense enough to support high speed rail but the distance is way too much to interconnect these 4 regions    personally id be stoked to be able to hop on a train in downtown houston skip having to be sodomized by tsa take a 2 hour train trip and arrive in downtown dallas much more convenient than flying since iah and dfw are both way on the outskirts of town and driving basically requires an overnight trip
  
is it really that shitty of an experience i bought tickets to take amtrak from the east cost to the west cuz it sounded like a chill trip and ive never done rail before i actually went out of my way to take the zypher so i could see the rockies over taking the southwest chief and not should i cancel the tickets
  the time during night is really boring without a sleeper which is expensive  if you want to see the rockies id fly to denver and go to grand junction and back that stretch is amazing the sierras are nice too but the western end of the appalachias to denver its just cornfields then theres another 12 hour stretch of high desert  you will be bored and probably surrounded by boomers for a large portion of it    id suggest fly to denver but the station is far from the airport and the train leaves really early heading west
  dope
perfect timing im actually planning on doing amtrak across the country this january yes planes are cheaper and faster but i love train rides and i want to take my sweet time getting from point a to b its been a decade since i left america and im looking forward to getting reacquainted with her  on the california zephyr what are the cities worth stopping off in im thinking id like to stop for a day or two in denver or glenwood springs opinions
  its not about size we just have shit infrastructure because thats gommunism and because americans shit themselves with fear when they see a minority     even a shitty regional train in europe is faster than our acela its disgusting what the nimbys have done
   we just have shit infrastructure because thats gommunism and because americans shit themselves with fear when they see a minority     its not that you fucking retard here is why trains dont work in the us or russia or other huge land nations    1 there is a shit load of different terrain that you have to account for seriously going from east to west coast you have 2 huge fucking mountain ranges desert and various nothingness the cost for a rail system just to properly go over the rocky mountains is astrofuckingnomical for a dedicated rail line on solely public transportation  2 the us when compared to any asian country eu or other places is stupidly far less dense wanna know why china has a railsystem for many things because it makes sense theyve actively built railroads to no where for the sole purpose of a political reason or fuck it why not  3 economically it makes no fucking sense outside what currently exists in terms of a rail system why the ever loving fuck would i go pay 300 dollars to spend 8 hours on a train when i could do a quick cheap 1 hour flight  4 when you build literally anything such as a road rail or other shit you always always have to plan for double anything because maintenance/repair    bbut my high speed rail like china or japan  see point 2 because america is so less dense per square km it doesnt make jack shit sense to build a flight would be cheaper regardless the only cities you could run to for those dense populations already have airports so why not take a cheap 50 dollar flight also due to the amount of mountain ranges and other shit you would have to constantly snake around shit or just drill through shit      america has rail to get around most people just dont take it since most people own cars take a bus or fly because it is so fucking more cost effective
i need something to hold my power bank cables wifi buddy and other small stuff while traveling in japan would a sackpack suffice or is there a better alternative
get a tote bag or messenger bag dont be an unfashionable cunt and get pic related
  both of those are inconvenient though
  sack bags suck because they will digg into you after a while just a normal backpack is fine or just get something with better than string strap quality you will be walking a shit load in japan more than you realize those strings will cut into your underarms
  op should get that sack thing so its even easier to tell that op is a fag
pockets can hold all that otherwise just get a daypack
  normal backpack is a bit too bulky      pockets arent big enough      
  i disagree i carried all of that in my pockets for two weeks while there but a messenger bag would also work
  how big is your power brick all those should fit fine seriously you can split things between eachother
  my pockets are just tiny
over the shoulder slightly bigger than a fanny pack has done me wonders the last few months in sea holds everything you mentioned any little things that you buy
a thread died for this garbage thread figures that op is going to japan
oh so you are one of those people who wear the small tight pants figures enjoy rashes on your armpits by day two dont say you werent warned    also  battery  lipstick sized battery packs are like 10 dollars on amazon and usually provide most phones one full charge  cables  require no space you put that in your back pocket  wifi pack  are very small similar to a cellphone shit usually smaller this could also fit in back pocket or friends pocket  other small shit to carry  protip here when you are going to buy something plan to go back and drop it off at your hotel room walking around with it will be annoying and you get it in a plastic bag anyways thats all i can assume you mean by other small things that could be too big for a pocket
1 for fanny pack  i have a manfrotto camera bag for things like this
  ive decided to switch to something like this because its so much less conspicuous think about it people take these to the gym or school everyday but how often do you see someone walking around with those big dumb blue osprey packs its like a rob/scam me sign
  messenger bag  fashionable  kek and i love the things
  get a day pack
  daypacks are a bit too big
  its like a rob/scam me sign    youre dumb youll looks like a tourist regardless unless you already know the area anyone attempting to rob or scam you knows how to read body language and pick you out in an instant changing a backpack wont mean anything
who here teaches in asia without a high school diploma so far ive taught in thailand/vietnam and now im onto cambodia i have a fake one i am able to present what would the repercussions be in cambodia if they found out i wasnt so far ive yet to be questioned about it and dont worry im not saying i have a degree or anything this has been working for five years for me
  i actually have a college degree the only reason i havent signed up to teach english is because i do not remember all the parts of speech and sometimes when autists try to learn a language for the first time thats how the like to deconstruct it    i dont like flying by the seat of my pants my nightmare is that a kid will ask anon whats a participle ill just shrug and then everyone will say but how can you not know its your language then i will lose my job and be kicked out of the country
  getting your tefl helps a lot i usually get a refresher course every few years when they go on sale some of them are really good
  fuck thats awesome all the time ive been told  i need a degree im a male white native speaker with blue eyes i think it could  be a fun game like the movie catch me if you can how easy is it anon
youre my hero i alt in japan and k do nothing i have a degree but cant teach for shit    ur a true nomad i hope you slide into the loins of a few of those third world sluts
i know people teach without degrees and as nonnative speakers in vietnam although its getting harder
  im pretty sure with the right connections one could simply buy a degree from a school for a few grand
i have bsc degrees in anthropology and neuroscience and an ma in public health could i get a reasonably well paying job with a tefl certificate in latin america i heard its a lot easier to get good positions if you have any type of grad degree
  why not get a job in public health a lot of those countries could use the help you could go digging up old ruins and awakening horrible monsters in your spare time
    i just assumed they probably dont need foreigners to do what many locals already can
  tefl is fantastic for teaching you how to teach but holy shit my celta program didnt teach me a goddamn thing about english  you basically had to know it coming in or figure it out from the lesson plans you were about to teach everything ive taught is something ive learned on the job in texts or remembered from prior foreign language studies french has similar tenses the best way to figure out how to teach parts of speech  grammar is to open an esl textbook and learn what the students will    i just applied for jet last week what am i getting myself into im already a tefl in the states but christ i want something different
how hard is it to do reputable teaching in china without a degree im white and an anglo leaf willing to do tefl/ielts but i might be too iq89 to get a degree
  if the locals can then why havent they    its why mexicans are more appropriately called mexicants its been a shithole for literally ever theres a famous book called two years before the mast about some guy who went to work on a merchant sailing vessel back around 18346 he sailed from boston to california this was back when california was still mexicant territory and he remarked in his book that california was a beautiful land with endless potential but the mexicant inhabitants were a bunch of lazy shiftless garbage who were pretty much useless i was shocked when i read it because it was just an offhand mention of what utter shit they were he wasnt even trying to make a point of it it was pure random observation of reality that was 180 years ago    within a couple of decades of his trip wed murricaed and annexed all of that beautiful land and then we made it productive a veritable beacon of prosperity and then reagan issued an amnesty for illegal aliens and they all invaded california and turned it back into a shithole      china requires a degree officially unofficially you can still find jobs there but its not like it was a decade ago keep in mind that their population bubble has popped due to their one child policy there are no more yellow peril human wave attacks of toddlers entering kindergarten whose parents are desperate to give their kids an edge by forcing them to learn engrish youd be better off in cambodia or vietnam    also iq has little to do with getting a degree any more ffs one of my grade school teachers was literally diagnosed mentally retarded and she still got a teaching degree and was teaching us 8th grade chemistry
  iq has little to do with getting a degree anymore  i get that im just tired of putting in the effort for what seems to be pointless in the end please write 400 words on why dostoevskys writing is /based/ isnt hard but its monotonous and i feel almost sick doing these little projects i like to learn i just hate the formalities
  dostoevsky  after high school  yikes
  пpo cмeшнoгo чeлoвeкa нaпишитe 400 cлoв o хapaктepe глaвнoгo гepoя    t russian major
  why is that yikes what do you read
  some guy 18346 he said  argumentum ad dead guy from the past says so it must be true    its been a shithole for literally ever  please post where you live
  butthurt mexicunt detected
  not even close  still not saying where he is from  ok
  no hs diploma    how do you get away with this in thailand i thought the cops raid schools like every day there and check foreigners for the right visa and degree etc is that just fud spread by old jealous farang farts     did you ever get stiffed out of payment by shady schools
  how into tefl if youre not a native english speaker
  pretend to be
tefl was a huge mistake on my part ama
  why im considering now i want to get away for the winter and life sucks at home
    you wont just be getting away for the winter the contracts are typically a year long and most of the schools for which youd teach will be outright garbage cram schools are among some of the worst places ive ever been and youd be lucky to have decent materials or be paid the correct amount
  contract schmontract you can just skip out once the weather warms up and they cant do shit you wont get your completion bonus and you might lose your most recent pay periods pay if you cant sweettalk the school into believing that your mother just came down with cancer or something      the cops do check if youve printed off fake degrees and filed the right paperwork theyll never know you only have a third grade education you just have to worry about the visa processing not doing a thorough check if the school you go to work for bribes them enough theyll ignore just about anything short of being black
  kek    you sound knowledgeable on tefl any experience in china im thinking of using a fake degree to get a work visa i heard it can be done but not sure how thorough a check the chinese embassy does im assuming its nothing     heard about anyone using fake degrees and getting work visas recently is it risky or nah
  it was for many people dont worry be grateful you have a first world western nation to return to instead of having to live all your life in the orwellian insect hives of asia
  not him but if rural areas or lower income school zones they will take anyone that can fool them    i have nothing past a highschool degree and a little college and have been asked if i wanted to come in and teach or tutor the second you leave a main city the instant shady shit like that starts poping up and becomes common
  sorry no idea about china why not go to thailand they have ladyboys there
  orwellian insect hives of asia    at least thailand is fun
  i guarantee 90 of american high school students dont know who dosto is
  different anon do people get jobs without degrees in thailand i know the pay is shit just wondering because it seems illegal to do without a degree do people get fake ones    i have heard of isrealis teaching with no degree and shit english     i have seen non whites like indians teaching in thailand too but people online say its impossible
  thailands lowend tefl market has been hiring filipinos like  says it just depends on whether your school pays off the right people
  if im a short brown man and have an online degree will i at least get payed better than the filipinos im a native english speaker but i know they value white skin
we now invite travellers in rows 116 to board the aircraft  entire planeload stands up in line people have to be repeatedly turned back by boarding staff wasting time and delaying the flight
  lmao fly business or get priority boarding like any other sane person  no need to put up with shit like that
  paying more money to literally sit down and wait while you arrive the same time as everybody else    lol
  being so new to air travel that you honestly cant fathom the difference it makes to be bumped from the rest    jokes on you mate  and i say that as a guy who only afford business through miles upgrades about 1 every 2 years though my membership gives me priority boarding
new to flying but holy shit i hate that in some airports you have to basically do everything by yourself like printing and tying those stickers or whatever to your luggage like bitch i dont have time to figure that shit out almost missed my flight because theres always fucking problems and i just dont have the time to understand how to do the whole process with all that pressure on me
  airline / alliance membership  travel often for work  if youre in rows 1732 wait for the first line to solidify and then join in  get advance access to seating does help you can get early dibs on ideal overhead storage
  cant speak for your experience but did you fly on a budget airline    some airlines will charge you a fee to interact with humans and shit compared to printing boarding passes at home / at the airport kiosk
  yes and the more people crave for cheap flights the less service is to be expected  when i was a kid 90s we realized how lucky we were to travel internationally there was staff everywhere both on the ground and airborne making sure everything was smooth and nice airports were relatively crowded but everything was quite nice  then everyone decided they had a right to travel market became extremely competitive staffs were shorted working hours were lengthened services were reduced or terminated altogether add the bullshit security processes post 9/11 and emerging countries now traveling too and air travel is becoming a living hell thats made bearable only because  a youre so excited about your trip you dont realize how shitty the conditions are   or  b you can afford business/first
  i feel bad as my first time on a plane a year ago i got up before the guy in the row in front of me as some people behind me did and started walking he asks me in a hurry and i respond confused um no thanks haha he probably thought i was such a little douche
  i hate people who get up and start collecting their bags before the seatbelts sign goes off but i also hate people who remain seated for ages and then block up the whole queue because they were too retarded to start packing up prior to landing
  sitting up front or having frequent flyer status doesnt prevent gate lice a well defined boarding procedure does southwest is objectively the best out of any us airline especially when it comes to boarding everybody else with 8 different groups for business/first/platinum/diamond/bismuth/tanzanite status and then 6 more groups for all other passengers need not apply
  this tbqhwyf  the airline i need to fly most has 2 lanes priority boarding business/first/ff above tier 1 and regular boarding  i appreciate that even though im the one with ff status im allowed to bring my companions in the priority boarding lane
  we dont know about the other travelers  perhaps they have a tight connection or some shit    anyhow id rather spend more time in the terminal waiting for my checked luggage sending messages to those who im visiting than spend time in the airplane    along your direction the people i have the most are the ones who remain sitting and then stand up expecting others to give them room to get their carryon luggage or to leave
  im biased because most of my flights include chinese travelers 0 discipline or pure tourists aka people who travel once a year to a resort and come to my place for that sole purpose next to 0 flight experience/etiquette  the result is the same they usually overpack and/or reach the plane late so the overhead compartments are already full when they board and their belongings are scattered they are anxious to collect them upon landing jumping out of their seat at the first occasion and ending up standing like dummies with their arms full because its 10 more minutes before the doors actually open and exiting the plane starts  i hate them because they force me to get up too and hurry to get my backpack with my laptop in it before they scavenge through the compartments like pigs after truffles and toss everything around half the times the passenger next to me sees this as an opportunity to get up too further clogging the row and leaving me sometimes standing up like a dummy with my arms full    i agree people with a tight schedule are justified to be ready to bolt out of the plane but anyone with a small flight experience knows that a fully loaded 777 or 380 will not start unloading passengers as soon as the taxi is done there is no reasonable motive to run like a decapitated chicken as soon as the plane stops
  although i travel to asia ive only flown into hong kong and for the most part the majority of passengers were okay  those who were ethnically chinese were either hong kongers or chinesecanadians both who have a good chance of being westernized    if more people would check their larger luggage thatd hopefully lead to less problems with carryon luggage assuming they dont exceed luggage limits  then again gate attendants should flag people for bringing on large suitcase sized cases as carryon    its definitely made worse with people either not knowing how to stow their luggage maximizing space carrying two smaller cases as carryons as opposed to one personal item moving the carryons of others or those who sometimes understandably dont want to have their carryons at the rear of the plane
not airport related but people reclining pisses me ofr even if im realistically losing very little leg space
  care you elaborate on anything specific on why people who recline piss you off    this can go a few layers deep
  have business class ticket  walk to the business class boarding desk  get told to stand in line with the rest of the sheep  weirdest thing it was at the emirates terminal in dubai     pet peeves  that guy who unloads his entire workstation in the seating area and takes up all the charging plugs  that guy who talks at the top of their voice on their phone in the boarding area  the indian/paki family who are trying to haggle the staff about price over something  the chinese tourists who always can be found repacking their suitcases on the terminal floor  at security asked to remove your shoes belt jacket accessories unpack bag etc expect you to redress in 5 secs  walk into toilets welcometomyofficeveryniceofficewelcometomyofficeveryniceoffice  work at the airport and interact with travelers all around the world doesnt speak any of the international languages  staff have no clue where anything is in the airport they work at have to ask store clerks  sign says go here get there and there are no further signage   lack of signage altogether
  im not sure just feel like ive been cucked feel the same way when someone cuts me off in traffic why does this happen
only issues i have is when families buy seats in separate areas and they sit in my spot i always choose a window so its not like im sitting in the middle of a row however for the most part everything is fine and ive flown probably 50x in the past two years i dont see business/first being worth it for the prices they ask
  ive got mine or i have the right syndrome  you should buy a first class ticket excusers    take the same mentality for other pet peeves in this thread and a similar mentality in this thread   and youll have a better idea    theres the right way and right time to recline but flying novices generally dont care to learn this sort of thing why should they care about you until something bad happens    transit buses have notices on how to make everybodys trip better airplanes understandably dont but perhaps airports should have informatics/diagrams on these topics      in a similar vein passengers behind you who grab your seat/headrest to gain leverage  so they can adjust themselves/their seat        kick them out of your seat just before takeoff
   i let them stay so they can be together aslong as i wont get wedged between two other people flight attendants love it too when you sacrifice your seat for a family so theyll be extra nice overtime ive learned to pack very light for the actual onboard part of the trip so i always board near the end of the line and i usually dont need overhead storage but even if needed the flight attendants usually close the full cubbies so its easy to identify where to put my jacket or something
  walk into toilets welcometomyofficeveryniceofficewelcometomyofficeveryniceoffice    i dont understand this one
the inconsistency in security protocol between airports  shoes off shoes on  laptop out laptop in laptop in its own tray  take your hoody off sir no your hoody is fine you can keep it on  when youre hitting lots of different countries in a short period it gets really annoying    long walks/poor signage to the lounges    people that video chat or stream videos in the lounge with no headphones    women who dress for flights like theyre home with the flu and just had a brutal breakup
  in south africa and other countries the toilet cleaning staff greet tourists to their office as a joke to get a tip the problem is that they do it with every patron who enters so you will try to take a shit while the toilet cleaner will have his own form of verbal diarrhea ad nauseam
   off shoes on  this is why god invented slipon shoes
  its still ridiculous     the terrorists won richard reid totally failed as a shoe bomber yet has probably cost the world economy hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars
  more loss of personal space considering that you already have limited amount of space while seated
  lose of personal space is unfortunately a given but hopefully people dont recline all the way    have you tried hard shell nonreclining seats
  i was told to stand aside during boarding even though i was 1a    when the gate agent was doing a precheck in the aircraft he locked eyes with me using a shocked expression    yes i tend to dress like a slob        plenty of ways to cost governments more money with less effort its everything else that comes along with it    if you travel enough go get something which gets you tsa pre
  i would think if youre flying that much youd get bumped up alot no    i only fly for work a few times a year so so im always with the plebs       the chinese tourists who always can be found repacking their suitcases on the terminal floor    i feel like every time i check my bag at a small checkin counter i always get stuck behind a family of africans/indians/jungle asians whose bags are overweight and they spend 20 minutes trying to repack and i end up stuck until theyre finally sorted or another worker shows up to the counter
  arab families with their 10 suitcases each what do they even pack in there
  high chinese tourist density on particular route  they start lining up 15 minutes before the gate even opens  5 minutes before the gate opens theres already a quarter of the plane in the line  stewardess announces the opening of the gate asks for rear/front of plane to line up first  no one actually gets turned back despite lining up 15 minutes before and being from random rows  youre seated right at the back and have to stop 10 times on the way while chinese people stop to get stuff out of their bags before slowly putting it in the overhead  get to your seat and a chinese person is sitting in the window despite you prebooking it  passive aggressively moves after you show them your ticket
indians and chinese with no concept of personal space who will literally stand so close to you that they are touching your back like its somehow going to make the line you are in go faster    happens to me all the time in asia
  this isnt airports so much but sometimes things with long unorganised lines full of tourists in se asia youll very often find locals who will just will just cut past them all and straight to front of the line i saw this all the time for the chao phraya river ferry in bangkok and ended up just following closely behind them as if i knew them saved me 20 minutes every time at peak hours
all the retards in economy class trying to board the aircraft immediately when the staff specifically repeated business only ten times already
  tnt
why do people stand in line for like 20 minutes while the crew faff about at the gate planes have allocated seating and the plane isnt going to depart any sooner or later whether you get on the plane before or after the other 250 passengers
  at least in the us on most airlines people think theyre saving an appreciable amount of time at their destination by packing carryon only so they crowd the gate attempting to be first on so that they get overhead bin space and can just walk off the plane and out the airport when they arrive us carriers except southwest also charge for checked bags so people try to save money by going full carryon and dont want to have to gate check the bag
when i was in munich a few months ago some fucking bitch ran past security right as my plane landed entire airport when on lockdown and was subsequently evacuated we were stuck on the plane for a while and then left through the back of the plane on buses then we stood in line for 2 hours waiting to go through customs because the airport was shut down damn krauts are too cautious
arriving just after a couple of planes from india/china and having to wait hours in the border control queue with pajeets and changs who always have visa issues
  no most airlines bump those who have no seating assignment from my experience but even that is rare make sure you already have a seat usually done when you buy ticket but can use official airline website and check in the day before
    oh and sometimes theyll pay people to take the bump seen 500 before i probably shouldve jumped on that but last day on visa
  get advance access to seating does help you can get early dibs on ideal overhead storage    want to stress that for any new traveler who missed it    ive pretty much gone back to checking bags i often have to anyway as i travel with gear just to avoid the angst of fighting for bin space stick my stuff that cant be checked under my seat and remain calm and unrustled
      but if thats the worst thing you have to deal with that day youre going to have a good day
  there is no reasonable motive to run like a decapitated chicken as soon as the plane stops    depends on how long the flight is though airline seats are not always the most generously padded sometimes my ass has had about all it can take for one day and standing up at least is a blessed relief
  takes up all the charging plugs    i always have one of these in my carryon now
  have you tried hard shell nonreclining seats    if you mean what i think you mean the important thing there is to make sure thats the row in front of you not necessarily the row you are seated in i cant get comfortable in a reclined seat so you guys sit behind me whenever you can
  i believe he meant bumped up like get an upgrade
  i hear ya but standing doesnt mean clogging up the aisles  i advise you try and stand up as much as you can during a long flight to release the pressure on your glutes also if you manage to steal an extra blanket you can fold it and use it as cushion
    fucking chinese indian and arab passengers are the worst    be me  flying to muscat from dubai  flight is filled with indian expats and smelly arabs  not a single one of them is listening to the flight attendants telling them to sit down while the plane is taking off  indian people attempting to light up cigarettes inside the plane  arab people treating stewardesses like shit    i like to think that by using basic fucking manners i improved emirates perception of white travelers immensely
  aww i havent usually they require additional  to upgrade when you check in im only 57 so leg room isnt a horrible experience as much as i fly im not a member of anything or have a credit card im not picky on airlines as long as its one way really unless multiple stops is extremely cheap and not much layover id do 600 one stop1000 one way but ive seen 400 two stops with 36hrs of layovers which is a nono
i much prefer being the last person on the plane no reason for me to get in line and wait i just sit and chill until the line dies and then head up after a minute its incredible how predictable humans are in a mob even when it doesnt benefit them at all to line up early they always will
  with 36hrs of layovers  it depends on if its a leisure trip or not and if the layover airport is in an interesting city those super long stopovers can make for an interesting vacation stop in and of themselves
trying to navigate through an airport without getting your instrument checked will definetly give you grey hairs so many horror stories of colleagues getting their guitars and other equipment smashed and yet the policies are only getting worse     once its on the plane its pretty much safe flight attendants are much more accommodating and always find a spot     other than that i just generally hate the fact that i have to go to some airport out of the centre of town 2 hours early just to do a bunch of sitting around and waiting    both reasons is why i prefer train no luggage hassle and you can show up 2 minutes before departure and youre good
for me its asians i refuse to believe anyone who says that american travelers or tourists are the worst because they obviously havent travel past their nose     that one highschool or college student trying to practice english with you  that asian family that lets their kids do fuck all  that asian couple that is super nice yet the dumbest mother fuckers and wont ask for any help with shit holding up everyone for their dumbshit  that asian couple that forgets sound travels yet again and is up at 3 am yelling at each other because the man was flirting with someone  that asian who gets told no you can not do this thing smiles and nods and goes about doing the thing they arent suppose to  that asian who doesnt understand that yes we can see your porn on screen   that asian who decides he can masterbate if he is quiet   that asian family who spends a shit load of time loading up with food and eats only like 3 crab legs leaving the rest untouched  those not yet out of college age asians who saw a movie about america an now somehow know everything about america  those asians who think they are badass because they can say fuck in english
  oh also  that asian family that pushes the limit of what is allowed by carry on     some how i dont think your 5 year old kid somehow needs a suitcase that is bigger than himself  a personal item
   people attempting to light up cigarettes inside the plane    oh shit this isnt just me    excuse me sir do you know if we can smoke on the plane now  uhh i think this is a non smoking plane as just explained by flight attendent   oh okay i only have 1 cigarette  no you cant smoke on plan  yes yes quick one cigarette do you have lighter  no i dont smoke and you cant on this plane  ah yes yes maybe they have matches    like the fuck is wrong with indians
  as an australian  that asian who gets violently angry when theyre caught by customs trying to deliberately sneak 15kg of birds nest and 24 different species of invasive larvae into the country  sir youve clearly stated that you had no food or animal products  me no speak engrish
  those australian border guard episodes are fun to watch
  i was trying to find a compilation of asian food smugglers breaking down but i cant find any 
  that asian who clearly is over duty free allowance trying to bring in a fucking truck load of goods to sell or some shit  sir are you sure this in under duty limit  ah yes all my thing here yes my luggage yes  sir i do not believe those items are under duty limit  yes this is my things yes   sir i am going to need to inspect your luggage  instantly flips the fuck out and starts yelling random shit
that asian family who has 0 trouble asking you for directions to their gate if the plane is here yet or other stuff clearly understands everything you just said  ask same asian family for virtually anything or about anything  sorry no english good i no speak english      every fucking time out of lax
  just watch random episodes they are like 50 of the material
  i dont think your 5 year old kid somehow needs a suitcase that is bigger than himself  a personal item  theyre paying for a whole seat fucko
  id bet the parents care more about the luggage space more than whatever the kid does the issue is more when a couple has a kid or two and because they have extra tickets they push the absolute limit of what they can do then getting on and off you have 2 people struggling hard as fuck to get items in or out
  c travelling is so stresful anyway that minor differences in comfort are undetectable
  you should try layflat seats some time
  trying to find somewhere quiet to relax and maybe try to catch some zs and someone else comes to the quiet secluded place to loudly discuss bullshit
  people who think its a good idea to eat dodgy airport chinese takeaway or fried chicken or something before flying and give themselves food poisoning that kicks in halfway through the flight  people who get drunk before/while flying  people who wont stop eating throughout the flight  people who recline their seat right into your face especially when the flight is under three hours
those people that act like i somehow know more about the plane stuff moreso than the employees or flight monitor    do you know if the plane is here yet  do you know how to change planes at destination  do you know why the plane is late  how big is the plane do you think my stuff will fit
lol  you pussies that complain about leg room im 62 and fly sydneylondon all the time in economy no fucks given obviously id take the upgrade to business but half you cunts are so soft
  why do people stand in line for like 20 minutes while the crew faff about at the gate planes have allocated seating and the plane isnt going to depart any sooner or later  this  aside from some trouble putting stuff in the overhead compartment theres no reason to be first on the plane  i always just stay seated and get on last no crowds to fight or queuing and my seat is still going to be empty obviously or the aircrew will move whoever thought they could steal my seat if i even want it after seeing what else is empty    theres always somewhere to put my bag anyway even if its not directly above me
  taking chinese airline  plane lands comes up to gate  people begin lining up  no ones even got off the plane yet  huge mess of people at the gate making it hard for people to get off the plane
  aside from  nigga that is the only reason i jump up to board as quickly as possible i regularly fly between america and asia and after a 14 hour flight im ready to blast out of the airport overhead space fills up fast and i aint gonna be one of the chumps who has to have his carryon luggage stowed below
  this is the chinese in every country at any event anywhere a line is required fuck why are the chinese such a meme race
  cleared aisles and access to overhead storage is the big one    lets say youre the last to board but youre ticketed near the front of economy class    the only available area for your carryon luggage is at the back on the opposite aisle    this means if you want to grab something out of your bag you have to go through an obstacle course of elbows and legs    at the end of the flight although youre sitting near the front of your section youre going to be the last passenger out of the airplane    the last person who leaves the airplane will also be the last in line for any immigration and customs      may i ask which chinese asian airline are like that    mainland china  eva air taiwan  cathay pacific hong kong  singapore airlines ethnically chinese    also where were you flying to and from      legroom is one thing but its also obstructions as well  supports for the seats in front of you force your legs to contort
arabs indians and chinese can be friendly wonderful people but god damn the shit you see them try to pull in airports/airplanes is unfuckingbelieveble
  i regularly fly longhaul j for work im not paying for it
  passive aggressively moves after you show them your ticket    after living in china ive learned to take this with pleasure and most of them know if they ever try to be cunts theres the risk of being put on the tourist blacklist or worse loose face in front of the entire chinese zerg rush
  those one hour layovers of which the connecting gates are at the opposite end of the airport through layers of security checks and during rush hour    malpensa and schipol never again
  theyre the worst people on any form of transport just rush rush gotta get on and get a seat fuck the pregnant lady or old man
  i see this complaint a lot but i usually try to get on first because sure i have a seat but i dont have allocated baggage space and im not storing my bag 10 rows away from my seat i want it directly above me
ive taken 16 seperate flights in china and ive not encountered anything worse or different than on other airlines in other countries     i think you guys are just extremely sensitive     the worst passengers ive experienced have been russians who seem incredibily fucking rude
  i dont relate to your anecdotal evidence however ill stand by my own anecdotal evidence  i dont even disagree with you i have dozens of plane/train/bus travels in china under my belt and i believe they were not more or less shitty than other travels elsewhere however this thread like 98 of threads on /trv/ is just about personal feelings and opinions you cant contradict an opinion with another opinion
  you cant contradict an opinion with another opinion     sure i can this is the internet
  then ill have to fight you
  but you already agreed with me i dont know why these other people have such wildly differing experiences with the chinese than us     the main complaint is that they start to queue before the plane is ready but that happens in literally every airport its the same with taking off the seat belts and getting luggage out moments after the plane lands the chinese try to do that but so does everyone else except me because im not a fucking retard
  you are the first person other than me on /trv/ who says this  i think /trv/ just hasnt met any russians and they dont dare to admit they havent met any russians
  i agreed on the chinese part i disagree that an opinion is more valuable than another so ill have to fight you even though we agreed on a different issue
  that indian who takes off his shoes and then the old indian woman who smells like curry trying to bring weird shit onto the airplane  fuck
  depends time of year you went what type of airline and how long you stuck in airports also its worth noting that while chinese people are in china act completely different the second they touch down in say japan canada or la they know that some of the shit they try to pull overseas doesnt fly in china
  the best thing i saw was a chinese guy wearing a black t shirt with the pornhub logo written on the front he had no idea and he was walking up and down the whole airport in london
  youre on 4chan and on /trv/ you are dealing with the same board that will have threads to bump limit about how someones holiday was completely ruined because when they were traveling an american was loud in public or drunk in a bar truly hard times for all people on trv    biggest thing i will say regarding chinese is that they are fine when flying within the country generally have people who will be quiet limited rudeness and just getting from ab issues do tend to come up with the ones who go overseas and try to get away with everything they cant in china though for the most part you wont get too many bad ones unless it is a tour group/bus
  jesus fuck why would somebody do this
  exchange rate and cost for exotic pets is just that worth it
  they are good people when they dont consider something part of a business transaction then its bad
  they are good people when they dont consider something part of a business transaction then its bad  seconding this  nice until money/business is involved then intolerable
    indians are literally the jews of asia they will try to save a buck in absolutely any situation its not even smart or money conscious its just cheap and pathetic
my longest flight was 10 days ago from amsterdam to vancouver a person died on the flight and it took us forever to disembark the aircraft on the way back there was this kid screaming consistently for 8 hours straight annoying everybody in the plane i wanted to cut my fucking throat off only business from now on
  either for the money or to satisfy a rather unique kink
  people dont die up in business that might be worth paying a bit extra then
that fucking hippie with a guitar/longboard/5 foot bong that acts shocked when theres no place to stow it  makes my blood boil  flying will always suck because people move too fucking slowly and have no sense of urgency at all i always sit aisle cause when that seatbelt light goes off im on my feet rip out my luggage from the overhead then full back my way down the aisle
  saw a chinese tourist lift a kid over a bucket with umbrellas so the kid could shit   i thought that was a meme
  most airlines bump those who have no seating assignment from my experience    an airline will bump a passenger with status before they bump some random yahoo who didnt pick their seat when they booked the ticket or checked in for the flight
as a kid i used to take a 30min flight in a turboprop the route was launceston to melbourne or vice versa so it was full of country bumpkins    without fucking fail some dumbass tasmanian would slump in his seat and then fully recline it onto my knees     nowadays i find the same kind of dumbass caveman like behaviour from kiwis and islanders basically the same thing at this point theyre like untrained animals
my swimming trunks in my cabin baggage setting off the radioactivity detector at budapest airport having spent several hours in the previous few days swimming/bathing in thermal and in some cases mildly radioactive waters in budapest and elsewhere in hungary  happened to me twice so far
  couple behind me watch tv show on their tablet full sound on so everyone can enjoy their shit tv show  pay for front row seat next to me stacy bring her lap dog and im allergic  a wild group of jews appears with travel for israel tshirt reserve all self checkin kiosk for their (((friends)))
  swimming/bathing in thermal and in some cases mildly radioactive waters  uh is your junk still working
  haha yes the hungarian nation have been doing this shit over the millennium since they settled in europe and arent dying out yet
  teen girls behind me on plane put their bare feet through the seat gaps    like wtfwhy do they do this
  i love flying i love airports and being on the plane with the odd drama and shit that comes with it i love the atmosphere its so comfy especially if you make a friend on the plane or in the airport  i purposely book flights with long layovers so i can spend more time in transit
  is it any different than usual the pool not your junk
that one backpacker dude who thinks he can take his bags on as carry on when it is clearly way over the limit  feels the need to argue with gate staff about how nuh uh it can fit i know there is room  its clearly well oversized and probably has a tent and sleeping bag in there    i not always a fan of airline staff but i always feel the worst when some idiot tries to argue his bag full of shit can fit when it is clearly not going to
  paying more money to literally sit down and wait while you arrive the same time as everybody else    based and redpilled
going through tsa  forget to take out that one tiny scissor   contents of bag gets thrown all over the counter   okay sir everythings fine now    this has happened more than once and i keep doing it
  i just cant fucking believe every single airport that sees more than 10 thousand people a day dont have a layover sleep hotel where you can rent a room for hours instead of a day and just sleep for a few hours or take a shower and freshen up i cant sleep on a plane and i sure as shit cant sleep in an airport on some shitty benches my biggest grief ever with travel is not being able to sleep for 40 hours travelling across the world
  agreed with this some airports in asia have cheap sleeping accommodations in the terminals like cubicles in japan and a spa lounge in korea but there needs to be more
i literally bring the tiniest fucking carry on because i always have checked luggage and when people stash 2 fucking suitcases and all their duty free shit and look at me like sorry youre going to have to put it somewhere else no cuntthis is why i bring only the neccessities on so i can have them near me
  there are hotels in or near airports but those are generally going to be large/chain hotels    and those large/chain hotels have corporate mandated pricing for the day and not by the hour    i havent tried it but you can probably get away with staying an extended period of time 6 hours at an airport lounge      id like to have a jjimjilbang / onsen close by/linked by a shuttle but this sort of thing is associated with asian cultures    itd be kind of weird to have a russian spa / banya in north america without some weird connotations    also access with going back to security lines which may take an hour would also bite into what little time you have to relax
    i havent tried it but you can probably get away with staying an extended period of time 6 hours at an airport lounge  i was just about to mention this just find a lounge that has showers and get a day pass
    some decent business lounges offer quiet spaces and shower facilities other airports like dubai do offer various sleep capsules that they charge by the hour really is dependent on the airport      god i hate this people who bring all their luggage as carryons instead of just checking in a suitcase the overheads need to have assigned space if your shit is over taking other passengers space then your excess shit need to be moved
  cringe and undertraveled
      fucking old muslims en route to hajj all traveled with small wheelie suitcases that they managed to keep as cabin luggage  since i always arrive just before boarding call and usually breeze through physical checkin i check in online the day before and carry only a 48h small suitcase i was pissed that the staff wouldnt let me keep my suitcase and made me check in  no shit it got lost during transit and i spent 4 days in china with my travel clothes only fuckers
i havent been on a plane since 2002 looks like im not missing anything
  you transited in saudi arabia
  not even reunion to mauritius to shanghai return from hong kong my phone died it was during a typhoon and i was in a different province each night so collecting my luggage was a bit of a mess
  hello fellowformer tasmanian
  that seems like a weird route for muslims to do hajj
  theres a huge muslim population over the general population in the local territories after slavery was abolished contract workers fled to reunion and nearby mauritius from china and india hence the large tamil/muslim/shintoist population in the current population  inb4 /pol/ local muzzies are pretty chill lots of them drink booze and prayers are mainly done in french because almost no one speaks arabic only late immigrants from mainland france or mayotte are more orthodox
  generally its because many airports were made when flying was stupid expensive and shit the concept of someone flying around but not sleeping in a good standard hotel was a head scratcher
travel more frequently than my peers  young as fuck i look like a teenager but imstarting my twenties   always get to conversate share my story and feel relaxed with the tsa and customs agents because im so young and travel so far     feels good

california is extremely boring and expensive ive lived in hollywood and the central valley
  nah man kaaskroketten      ive lived in hollywood and the central valley  theres your problem    the classic ca roadtrip typically goes like this sf  yosemite  sequoia  la  sd      it really depends on what youre into theres so many hikes about the whole state and most of them are pretty spectacular     top of my head i could recommend   kings canyon  monterey and the aquarium over there 17 mile drive in pebble beach big sur  ventura  oak tree gun range just north of los angeles its a nice range up in the hills  just about any hike up in the santa monica mountains although im not sure how viable that is right now due to the fires that just passed through rip paramount ranch  the snake part of mulholland drive if youre a car guy  the getty villa and/or center    theres too much to list actually
mexico is a complete shit hole every single spic has their beedy little eyes on your cash there are sinkholes filled with garbage and piss there are a constant hazard on every sidewalk best of luck
californians are shit tier people and hollywood is an organized pedophile network have fun
please help me find where this is i need to know my guess is florida or cali good luck
its in tampa
my professional opinion would be hialeah or miami springs
  read the knowyourmeme article dumbass
  hialeah does not have that many trees
just find any random white neighborhood in summer

anywhere cheap/nice in the us maybe other countries i can stay for a month or so and learn to snowboard play in the snow and fuck girls from tinder
  some of the canadian ones in bc are cheap because the local economy sucks and lower canadian dollar    kimberly and red mountain/trail can get accommodation under 1k cad and a seasons pass for 1k cad

  move to some ski town in colorado with public transportation like breckinridge    understand though no matter what ski town you move to getting laid is tough there can easily be a 10 guy to 1 girl ratio imagine walking into a bar with 200 dudes and 20 girls if even that many chances of leaving and getting laid are pretty slim if you know what i mean
  understand though no matter what ski town you move to getting laid is tough there can easily be a 10 guy to 1 girl ratio    i didnt think of this at all _
  if 101 ratio keeps you from fucking in the first place than any other time youve ever had sex was just pity sex or nearest best option if you can pick up women easily in a normal ratio nothing will change but your own choices being slimmed down
  get a job at a ski resort for the winter pay is shit but you get cheap dorm housing a season pass and youre surrounded by drunk hormonal twenty somethings every day  most ski seasons kick off in december but theres always vacant positions because people flake out fuck up get fired leave early or just dont even report in the first place
  ski town  cheap  pick one and only one  i live in a ski town that isnt even particularly popular and studio apartments or one room cabins routinely go for over 1000 a month
  i work online and dont want to live in a dorm/hostel but i do want to be around drunk/stoned 20somethings      1k is okay
  1k is the low end in an unpopular ski town
  not in utah/
dude ive looked around i wanted to take an off year or two in a ski town and just ski and have fun i looked around the fucking world it just isnt there man it is even expensive in places that are usually really cheap even in asia anything close to resembling the resorts in the us are going to cost you big
  you could rent a cheapish place in salt lake city and drive to the wasatch every day to go skiing but the traffic and air quality suck in slc
  yeah i think im just going to stay in california and go to tahoe which is expensive but manageable my problem is i dont have a car and i dont really want to buy one for a winter so it fucks everything up    bansko bulgaria looks cheap in terms of cost of living
  yeah my kick is i want to be able to have a drink while skiing and not have to worry about getting a dui so even though i have a car i dont really want to use it im looking up bansko bulgaria right now if i can find something that seems like a compromise ill report back ill also be super excited because that will 100 be my next travel destination

why are tourists pretty much universally hated    and im not even talking about the obnoxious travelers with massive fluro coloured backpacks i quietly keep to myself when traveling and i still get dirty looks
  you answered your own question  all tourists get lumped in together man
selfconscious people dont like the idea that their everyday life is a spectacle to somebody
  but he didnt get banned did he
  the problem isnt necessarily the tourists themselves but how mass tourism is handled in the city
  barcelona would literally go bankrupt without tourists
  correction  without tourists people in barcelona would be free to work jobs for their own sake again and not hand them over to international criminals who dice up the local culture to sell to traveling petty criminals whove been invited there by a moneygrabbing international conglomerate    there are embassies for a reason   simply forcing all potential tourists to go to the embassy of the country they want to go to complete a basic language test and answer a few questions without exploding would solve most of the problems with tourism as the people who get insulted at the idea that they cant just decide to walk into peoples back yards screaming and hooting and demanding preferential treatment will sperg and get themselves banned from international travel for ten years  the criminals are caught in the net the entitled invaders are caught what remains are only the people whore willing to spend a millionth of the time on another country that the natives have  it only goes to figure that more should be expected of a tourist than should be demanded of a citizen whos supported the culture and economy since birth
  implying people are forced to work in the tourist trade    so you mean that there are industries in catalonia that are just crying out for labour forces that they can not get because the labourers are all busy cleaning hotel rooms interesting take
  this
  real traveler tm seeks to have his one true way legally mandated    now the list of things i have seen contains everything
  i dont think they are hated schemers love them people who learn foreign languages too and people who want foreign sex
  yeah i cant imagine why a bunch of non native people coming clogging up what can often be a peaceful area would be bothersome to people
  why are tourists pretty much universally hated    assumes facts not in evidence
because youre literally so well off that even if youre backpacking on a budget and eating ramen you still have more disposable income than most countries that you go to
  back to /pol/ asshole
  ill bite because in areas where tourism is a major part of the economy infrastructure and services are often structured to benefit the tourists and not the locals take airbnb for example sure it started out just as a way for people to make money renting out a spare room but its really fucking with the housing markets in a lot of places because what used to be full time residences are now becoming parttime vacation rentals that reduces the amount of available residential property and drives prices up which mostly impacts the working class locals or when the local hardware store is replaced by a gift boutique yes both businesses make money and employee people but one provides a valuable service to the local community while the other only provides a service to tourists  tourism brings in a lot of money but it also ultimately makes it harder for the locals to live their lives
  you sound like exactly the kind of person who gives tourists a bad name
  whenever i see this image i always imagine an asain walking around an aussie city with an akubra not sure why but it cracks me up each time
  is there anyone on this planet that doesnt despise chinese tourists    im australian and fucking hate other aussie tourists there was one time in austria where i was touring a palace quietly the building was filled with red carpets rolling gold ornamentations and lavish furnishings and i see this dirty unkept fucker with a headband and huge backpack saying to the guide yeah nah mate wheres the toilet have some respect jesus
    fellow aussie here cant stand korean/ chinese tourists where i live in there are hundreds of these guys and theyre absolutely braindead they have no respect or consideration for others    any time i encounter them overseas is just as bad if not worse
  are they ive literally not had this experience
    the problem with living in an australian city is you cant tell the difference between a chinese tourist and one whos lived here for 3 years and still doesnt speak the language
  the people that benefit the most from tourism in spain are the already mega rich hotel owners chains banks and real state agencies that own most of the touristic flats and airbnbs     the salaries in spain have stagnated and outright dropped since the crisis and seasonal and hospitality workers have lost a lot of rights privileges and job security while prices keep rising in particular rent prices in barcelona and ibiza are insane and people blame it partly on the tourists why rent to a worker and make 500 a month from the flat when you can rent it by weeks to tourists and double or triple the amount     so when you say that people should be grateful for tourists coming into your city you are saying that you should be grateful for having a shit job where you are most likely underpaid overqualified and overworked and that barely allows you to cover basic stuff like your rent the same job also offers you no stability and you may only work 5 months a year whatever the owner requires to keep milking the tourism cow with minimal costs and service
  theres also the factor of gentrification and loss of culture most european capitals have long lost their city centers to tourism no locals live eat drink or party there due to inflated prices and turning traditions and local culture into an spectacle for tourists can be a sort of prostitution that ends up changing and losing the authenticity of it again barcelona has the clear example of festes de gràcia which were relatively unknown by tourists until the last couple of years now the massive influx of tourists has made them put additional regulations into place which imo are necessary and do not affect the whole experience that much but is a step in a worrying direction
i live in venice and id just say venetians are either communist or fascist assholes its not like we dont get special walking lanes or public transportation for a tenth of the price  and theres still plenty of businesses useful to the residents and its not like the non tourist part of the city on the mainland has many more mestre is filled with shady immigrant businesses  also every local moves out of venice because having a car is so much more comfortable anyways
  fucking kek  yep all according to xis plan who needs to learn the language of a new colony  t student assessment officer whos had to bring in translators for masters students
    thats all good im getting off this god foresaken island as soon as i finish university
  i quietly keep to myself when traveling and i still get dirty looks  we dont get that anon i think its just you  why do people give you dirty looks literally everywhere you go what do you look like
  thats the problem tourism should never be the majority income source for a city or hell even a country its an unstable industry and it mostly creates low wage service jobs  belize is another good example of why you shouldnt have a tourism based economy
spain is a socialist shithole so i am not suprised about turist atitude  because in areas where tourism is a major part of the economy infrastructure and services are often structured to benefit the tourists and not the locals  it like saying that minining or fucking it foregin company is destroying local economy   this is not how economy works desu go read rothbard
  youre oversimplifying it if the tourists are gone and the house prices are lowered but you lose all those tourism related jobs you cant afford those cheaper places anyways spain is a clusterfuck of an economy they dont produce anything of value they dont have resources to boost up the economy and now these idiots want to drop another income sounds like lazy southeners who just want to be spoon fed a good life to me    the world is not perfect its not severely overpopulated the competition for jobs and resources is higher than ever to me spain just failed at adapting the older generation fucked the younger ones hard and the younger generations arent smart or clever enough to improve the situation as an example here in vancouver where house prices are high people pushed the government to change regulations to both tax foreign investors more and ban air bb except for those with special permits or in a persons main residence why isnt barcelona doing this no its better to spray paint tourists go home on city walls that will do the trick if they were hard working enough to produce other income sources for the citizens of the city no one would care about the amount of tourists      you cant compare belize to barcelona a city in western europe to an impoverished developing nation like i wrote above blame the people for not diversifying and now crying about it
  sorry meant to write its now severely overpopulated
  this is not how economy works  go read rothbard  lol
  well i agree spain is not a functioning economy without tourism we have no secondary sector that can compete within the eurozone however much of the touristic model is based on low quality and low prices that are sustained by low salaries and bad working conditions i am not saying that i support the hurr durr tourists go home i was merely answering ops question as to why tourists are hated and explaining why the richness created by tourism is not fairly distributed when your only career options are to serve as a waiter to the richer economies of europe or emigrate somewhere where you can actually put to use your higher education you sure as hell start resenting the people you are serving to
  or emigrate  i have 2 things to say about this one is that migration is a natural path for humans think about it if you were born on the coast and you developed a love for the mountains youll likely move closer to them if you were born in colorado but your whole life you dreamed of becoming a marine biologist you will likely move to the coast if you were born in a small town and get a degree in finance youll likely be looking to move to a financial center like new york or chicago its just natural and the spaniards have it easy they have all of europe to do it and a top10 passport which gives them the ability to go abroad easily    the other thing is many other countries dont have these opportunities its not like these people were born in some bumfuck village in india where they struggle for food and education spain has good universities barcelona itself has a couple good ones including some of the best business schools in the world get education get a specialization learn english and some other language and move where you can get a good job my parents moved in their late 30s to canada because they werent going to ever have a good life in poland at that time i was a child when i moved with them here in canada they have a good middleclass life theyre not crying about it because they worked their butts off and didnt have a fucking entitled attitude
what is it like for nonamericans to visit america what are the first things you notice does it make you miss home after a few days every time i leave the us i start remembering how comfy i am at home in my own environment after a week or so but maybe thats just because living in hotels sucks
they go to nyc miami or la and complain about everything
  lol first post is best post
  i live in canada and go to the states 35 times a year mostly for shopping and to eat mexican food or buy lottery tickets if theres a billion dollar jackpot bu i also travel a lot in the states been to 13 states in total seen pretty much everything there is to see in wa and or did a motorbike roadtrip down the 101 all the way to san diego my favourite part of the world is actually around the grand canyon such immense natural beauty in southern utah and arizona    my experiences are almost entirely positive next year i plan on spending at least a week going over to yellowstone and glacier national parks i would also love to visit the east coast in the near future    i guess youre looking to hear something negative so here it is in the cities the first thing i notice is how soulless the suburbs are while san fran or portland city centres are great everything that surrounds them is just rows and rows of houses it gets even worse in places like phoenix where the good areas are few and far between
my experience traveling to the states from canada is that it is almost identical and so i assume the rest of the world is too    what a boring planet
  well sorry pal i have been to la new york miama and san francisco and las vegas and it all sucked   but really it a great place to travel to and especially liked the free pot in la and great craft beers on the west coast i went to oregon and really enjoyed portland and also washington state  and ny is really fun liked the arab/mexican food from those street sellers  one day will get an rv and do the national parks waiting for the dollar to be more in my favour
  i wasnt really looking for negative or positive i just wonder how my normal seems to someone else canada doesnt really count desu
the first thing border control they are the biggest scum out of any border control people on earth and ive been to a lot of places us border control is the only one where they would dare to try and ask for my phone number suggesting they want sex ive been there many times before but after that one time i decided to stop going unless there is a family emergency  so thats the very first thing you notice how much you are looked down upon as an alien freedom  at the parking lot i always internally cry at the lack of passable public transport  it takes a few days to actually mentally arrive and relax but afterwards its really nice i love the nature wherever i go in the us cities are meh but whenever its a less populated area its invariably beautiful
  canada  lmao
  for the bay area you should check out the north of sf not the east or south bay sonoma and napa county is beautiful it feels like youre in an idealized tuscany mixed with pnw nature
  towns have a classic americana feel too
  can i have your phone number babe
  america is pretty diverse place the architecture/urban design might not differ much but the beautiful nature plays its influence in each different ecosystem
  yellowstone is based to the highest degree its my favourite place on earth and thats coming from a yuro
  picks a 15mm sonoma county mansion to illustrate that american houses reflect the natural environment    yeah nah
  i seriously dont get you guys its natural disaster all right is it now gonna be brought up in any mention of norcal even if its not relevant at all its for a tourist in any midwestern place i can post tornadoes and say its shit or hurricanes on the gulf japan is an objectively shit place to travel and work at because of earthquakes
  im not sure what natural disasters have to do with the conversation yes some places have different kinds of natural disasters a 15mm mansion carefully landscaped to resemble an tuscan farm house but with regionallycorrect flora and minimalist irrigation techniques is still not a typical representation of the relationship between buildings and the environment in this country
  i always immediately feel at home although more on the west coast than east i always stay with friends and never in hotels though    i enjoy the energy of places like los angeles and nyc that always keep moving mentality it energizes me just be around that
  those hills is not the result man made techniques its a manifestation of a pygmy forest pic related 19th century my family has land like this its filled with wilderness like those hills the average middle class home in the suburbs has that view if theyre at the edge of town its rare and only occurs in a few places in the world
  something like that doesnt even register with me it was way worse
  seriously do you have huge tits and were flauting them or something
  story
    i was on a business trip then i was flaunting my laptop backpack more than anything my tits are not for any random persons eyes in the first place and are especially well hidden when i travel for business very formal loose blazers all  i regret not having recorded it i was just totally caught offguard cause this happened after the usual immigration process  some us border control guy asked for my passport right after the immigration desk and held it with that predator grin for minutes while telling me how hot i was and how i should get into modelling how he wants to take photos of me he proceeded to go on and on even though i had my most jetlagged face and my only verbal response was asking if there was a problem with my passport after the nth question he realised that i was very desperately looking for a supervisor and then he finally tossed back my passport  i wish i recorded it ever since then i have my phone ready for recording before talking to any sort of person of power one on one i dont care about the no cell phones signs    could have been worse its just i havent experienced this in shitholes so it was interesting that the us has this scum on the border
      tldr i dont remember precisely
  yeah those trees that just happened to be in a perfectly straight line at exactly the same height spaced symmetrically around the terrace obviously just happened to be there idiot    also you havent addressed the question about natural disasters why is that
  why are you on /trv/ lol
  it was interesting that the us has this scum on the border  interestingly enough as an american im always shocked how many of our customs agents have fucking foreign accents
    going to europe honestly doesnt even feel like youre leaving north america
  was he black
    were you molested as a kid the reason i ask is every woman ive met who has stories like this was molested or raped early on by like their dad or their teacher or something i think that makes you permanently give off this special phermone or something
  good job moving the goalpost after being called out for your ignorant take on shit you know nothing about nobody is talking about trees people plant on their fucking patio you literally thought those hills are the result of landscaping lmao also dont understand why youre targeting that one specific picture as if posting the terrace of a wineryits not a home implies every home looks like that i can walk outside and end up in wilderness that looks exactly the same in less than 5 min
  so this is the hill youre going to die on is that it    you overreached got upset when this was pointed out started raving about tornadoes and are now trying to turn this into a debate over which trees specifically you wanted the conversation to be about    btw you should look up what moving the goalposts means you cant just randomly throw that in when youre losing an argument to try to turn things around
  unfortunately you cant say america in public and hear nonnegative things in response
  from 19982009 i lived a fiveminute drive from that park haha    sonoma county is awesome fuck everyone else
from a dutch perspective    giant food portions  soda/pop/coke with every meal  no public transport  homeless people everywhere  people chatting you up all the time  hunting/fishing culture is much more prevalent
  his hair was between scandi blonde and slav blonde natural blonde for sure generic white dude    no is that why this never happened to me elsewhere
  similar thing happened to me after clearing immigration in my home country australia not sexual just the guy acted like he could do anything he wanted and was asking total bullshit questions i think they do it to entertain themselves i was so tired i wanted to kill the guy probably what makes it fun for them
how freaking huge the us is the first time i went i thought i could drive nycmiami in about six hours
britbong here  everyone friendly and quick to start conversation with you  root beer literally the tastiest beverage known to man  waitresses at diners refill your coffee without you asking them  beautiful countryside  american flags everywhere  strong desire to become a cowboy hat wearing redneck driving a big truck  america just gives me a warm fuzzy feeling i cant stay there too long or ill want to never leave
  dominican here the only thing i notice is how everyone keeps to themselves which is great given how people here are nosy touchy and a little overfriendly    besides that ive never had any cultural clash or problem in the us thank god ive been in naples atlanta chicago and orlando     ive never felt like missing home there and cant say americans have treated me bad in any trip i really like your country friends of the north
  root beer literally the tastiest beverage known to man  youve gotta be the first euro ive heard say that i got a can and gave it to a few friends norwegian and danish and they all thought it tasted like some kind of cough syrup    then again mug or aw definitely dont do root beer justice to get the best stuff you gotta go to the independent root beer stands
  same here root beer kicks ass
  soda/pop/coke with every meal  ive heard this from other people and it strikes me as really odd i rarely order or drink soda with a meal maybe its where i live but i think i know more people who drink no soda than i do people who drink a lot of soda
  ive never been to the us but it always amazes me how vast the country really is gigantic desu
im going to portugal in december i was told i need a international divers permit how long does it take to get one
5 minutes and 15 minutes at a aaa office bring 2 passport photos
  my state just updated their ids to confirm with the national real id law they are hilariously slow on getting new ones out and i have a temporary paper one you think that will be a problem
  nope
what are most airlines policies on having aerosol deodorant in hold luggage seem to be getting mixed messages from google
whats the best place around munich to snowboard in february
  how big i dont think one less than the 3oz should be a problem
from southeast us been to peru before but only on a short trip with a group ive got long summers off so would have about two months to relax would spend short time i guess in rio just to take photos and to avoid getting favelad before heading to the south of brazil into uraguay and some time spent in argentina sound for two months enough to keep me busy what would be a good gestimate for costs of it
  depends on how outdoorsy you are i could easily spend 2 months hiking around patagonia but if youre from the south you could hike the appalachian trail and get the same experience youd get in argentina
do you ever feel lonely travailing alone
  from my experience most if not all airlines would prefer aerosol to be in carryon/hand luggage not checked/hold luggage reason being that many aerosols are an explosion/fire risk if that were to happen albeit unlikely at least its easier to control in the cabin if its in the cargo/luggage hold next to nothing can be done about it    now if youre bringing aerosol deodorant in carryon/hand luggage you now have a volume restriction youre gonna need a can that holds less than 34oz or 100ml
  what are most airlines policies on having aerosol deodorant in hold luggage seem to be getting mixed messages from google  itll all be ripped from tsa guidelines if in carryon it needs to be 100ml or less checked just have a normal size nothing that will freak them out they do worry about leaks in the belly of the plane so have a ziploc around it and everything else in the bag pretty tightly wrapped
    be me living and working in japan  have two friends who were originally planning to visit me together  they recently had a falling out it might be the end for their friendship  friend 2 is planning to book a flight to visit doesnt seem like hes gonna tell friend 1 either    friend 1 is my best friend and i feel like the other guy going behind his back like this would be a giant fuck you to end their friendship should i tell him about this as a headsup is it possible hell feel betrayed for being complicit in hiding it if he finds out afterwards i dont want to be caught in the middle
i dont think there is a need for an idp i rented a car in portugal march this year and drove with my florida license with no problem    note that car rentals in portugal are notorious for scamming people look up the reviews from the lisbon area    in case this is something youre doing renting a car in lisbon i highly highly recommend renting a car from echo rent  not shilling but i had a great experience with them in a very nice car for not much money what ive heard from friends that drove in portugal is that they would find the tiniest scratch and charge hundreds if not thousands of dollars for it    another thing that is done in portugal which is stupid is they advertise the car rental company on the car so thieves know which car to steal from essentially echo rent as far as i know from my experience did not do this
i think you can scuba dive anywhere once youre licensed
  wow im an idiot i read international drivers license  my bad im an idiot
  not renting a car im renting a motorcycle i contacted the company and they require a idp for any non eu citizen rentals
does anybody have experience traveling in middle america islands is the island hopping as easy as in sea thinking of from dominican to puerto rico and so on to the smaller islands in east
confused brainlet here how do i get started on points/rewards systems such as air miles frequent flyer airline clubs/alliances credit card travel rewards etc    how much harder is it if you have varied tastes in traveling im based in north america but just in the past few years alone i ended up in northeast asia then southwest asia very few alliance overlap with airlines that is im considering europe or central asia in future trips at any rate its not like im a boomer who sticks to a single vacation spot or a businessman who flies back and forth between the same two countries
  without flying youll have to catch rides with yachts there are virtually no international ferries in that area
    there are easily accessible ferries within the bahamas and a ferry to florida but in my experience flying will be the easiest way to go in the caribbean proper       pick a credit card that offers huges signup bonuses and then pick one of the 3 alliances to concentrate your points into i only fly star alliance unless im flying domestic and then i prefer southwest and theyve got great coverage all around the planet including avianca and ethiopian for south america and africa plus singapore is pretty much the best airline around    the great middle eastern airlines arent part of alliances unfortunately
  didnt work you need the plastic i guess
hostelworld or bookingcom
  both compare prices and book with whoever is more to your liking
  ive carried spray cans of off and such never had a problem
  from my experience most if not all airlines would prefer aerosol to be in carryon/hand luggage not checked/hold luggage      has anyone else encountered this it runs exactly opposite to my experiences
  your best source of info on getting such a permit would be your local dmv
  thre are ferries hopping between islands that are near to each other few making longer crossings among the close islands there are more likely to be ferries between islands that are in the same political distribution though there are a few ferries across international lines such as between the us and british virgins    but ferries are not a viable way to get from one end of the caribbean to the other
  i know i gotta get one at aaa just have to hope the plastic card gets here before i leave
  i never had a problem with either version i always made sure my stuff was below 100ml though so that i dont have to worry about putting stuff in either bag
  not so much a question as a big shoutout to baltimore waaaaay underrated as a city really cool place great architecture really nice people cool history great food zero crowds if anyone has the opportunity to check it out highly recommend a long weekend trip
  yes force yourself to act out of your comfort zone

i dont know shit about diving are the suits thermically isolated the atlantic in december would be extremely chilly
do female expats hate their male expat counterparts   every time i read an article by a white female expat in an asian country like china or japan it always seems like they have a subtle hatred of white guys especially in asian countries    this particular woman seems to be a common character she excludes the local asian mates exclusively pursuing/expecting a white male expats boyfriend whilst also showing a veiled hatred for white males in asia she laments that many of them are too spoiled for choice with local women to pick her but then also discredits them as too undesirable to find a mate in their home countries  it just doesnt seem to make sense one could say shes just one bad apple but i see these characteristics commonly in white female expats in asia
  well her reaction is pretty normal women in sea tend to do ngo stuff or teaching and similar there is a small subset of sea expat males that are in the same situation but there are 900 more that are there to taste the lbfms some expat women know and accept this part some do not some expat women are into lbfm lesbians as well and who can blame them    at the end of the day i am quite interested in female expats especially those from the more educated parts of europe when youve spent a couple of years with women that know next to nothing it feels quite good to have a drink with a woman that can talk about trotskij as well as napoleon somebody that is aware of world history and actually have an inkling about the political system in the country or countries where we are residing
is my dog going to be safe in cambodia more specifically phnom penh if he was stolen or killed to food i am sure i would die there i read horror stories about stolen dogs but is it just hype anyone know anything about this
  dont travel with your dog
  i am planning on moving out of the country for a year id really like to bring my dog but he could stay with my mom i guess it seems mexico may be the best solution i just need to find a safe and cheapish spot     how much do you guys think it would cost to live lets say a year in or around la paz or similarly decent area and have a pretty good standard of living i mean i figure 20k should cover it pretty easy
  im a sucker for branding and baltimore seems to have the natty boh branding down speaking of beer in baltimore  de kleine duivel had an amazing assortment of beers and knowledgeable staff i really enjoyed it

are there any fast food restaurants ie mcdonaldstier that are actually worth visiting in the world    a lot of people say that jollibee in the philippines is pretty good  apparently people also like to visit the harland sanders cafe in kentucky ie the precursor to kfc  many americans also talk highly of chickfila  mcdonalds dubai is apparently very luxurious    for the record fast food doesnt revolve around my life but its kind of a tertiary hobby
  for me its the mcramen the best fast food soup dish only found in hawaii
  i definitely wouldnt go out of your way to see the original kfc its cool for a stop if youre passing through but its nothing special chickfila is great but youll find that almost anywhere

how does the number of days work with visa free countries  say you have a limit of 20 days in country abc you stayed for 15 days in country abc returned to your home country and wish to return to country abc  do you get a new set of 20 days does it vary from country to country    i have only ever gone in to them and never came back this time around im gonna come back and possible exceed the limit
  some counteries have hard limits like you can stay 90 days out of ever 180 days after that you cant come back it prevents people from living there and just doing visa runs like they do in china
  it prevents people from living there and just doing visa runs like they do in china  oh no im talking about taiwan i hope they dont have the same thing ive checked their policies for my home country and dont see any hard limits mentioned nonetheless i tried to contact them asking about it

  that sounds like a pretty cool idea but i see a couple of drawbacks if you use this bag for traveling it might come off as a very obvious sign that youre a tourist making you a bigger target than usual if one of the flags sewn on your bag happens to be an enemy country of wherever youre going you might get some dirty looks or even worse some serious questioning examples bringing an israeli flag to an arab/muslim country or an armenian flag to azerbaijan etc if you mean like a gym bag then disregard i suck cocks

in nepal currently  hoping to see hornbill in northeast india  then myanmar    but im in a world of visa pain  a i can only get an indian evisa if i fly twenty times the price of the bus  b if i get an indian visa from kathmandu ill have to extend my nepali one as indian processing times are poor and pay for a six month indian visa even though im on going for a month  c arriving in myanmar by land is an option but i dont have time to get indian inner line permits on an indian transit visa  d im unsure if i can get myanmar restricted area permits outside myanmar at all even if i get the regular tourist visa as soon as i cross from the west im in restricted territory
  ive seen people who put patchs on their jacket which they just take off if they thinik it will be an issue
  i keep thinking about this i have a pretty decent sized budget if i paid like idk 20002500 a month for rent that should be enough to keep my dog safe right be open spot and guarded i would want an enclosed area so i wouldnt have to take him around the shit seeing as its a third world country and i pay less for rent here that should be possible right
is scrapbooking for women  faggots    for better or worse i have a lot of stuff left over from past travels im talking things like boarding passes event tickets etc of course i even have photos i want to compile them into a book of some kind for muh memories does anyone who identify as a straight male do this kind of shit
  who the fuck cares man jesus christ just do it if you want to you know worrying like that about what your mates will think of your scrapbook is 100 times gayer than the book could ever be
how fucked will i be if i just get a rental at the airport without booking before im going to rome with a friend for a few days this weekend
  i say do it my mom started a book of my travel photos and surprised me with it its really a great conversation starter more personal than just posting on facebook and nowhere else
  is this you coming out post    i move too much to be able to keep this sort of stuff and im also quite lazy however my friend creates these pdf printable photo books everytime we travel together its quite cool easy to show to the family
my family invited me on a trip to south carolina they tend to do the same things they do at home with the addition of different places to eat question is what do you do while travelling touristy shit tends to bore me the people bore the landscape is nice
  theres no reason to rent a car in rome anon

how do i get over pretravel nerves ill be going to china for my first ever solo trip and im pretty hyped but it can also be a really scary idea at times
  depends where youre from youre kinda dumb for not mentioning what country youre from right off the bat but whatever     if youre american you dont need one i rented a car twice in portugal this year on an american drivers license with no problem     if you ever want a international permit you just need to go to aaa they offer this service
  this  worked in spain for a car rental company international driver licenses are only required for people coming from countries that use a different alphabet altogether i e chinese arab cyrillic     some things that actually are required and you should bring with you when renting a car  another valid id besides your drivers license  a working credit card from which to take a deposit  making sure that your drivers license is in order and not expired     also look into online insurance the one offered at the counter is usually a big ripoff

can you take books from a hostel
  wouldnt leave the airport desu 4 hours isnt much time to go somewhere and then get yourself back through security and since the airports out on an island with nothing around youd have to take the express train into the center to go anywhere worthwhile    that being said hkg is one of the best airports in the world and pretty large so theres gotta be at least several sports bars both before and after security you could check
  in that case i imagine that it would depend on how clearly it states in your license what type of motorcycle you are allowed to drive to be completely safe you should follow company policy but desu the people at the front desk probably wont give a fuck
indians     oh no no no no
  that would be stealing
  bring something to mask the smell
  what is that for

what the fuck is even going on in this thread
what asian country has the cheapest and most accessible heroin i was thinking cambodia would be a good go for things but maybe laos or myanmar would be better thoughts and price per gram
  around 90 percent of heroin in the world originates in afghanistan
  i doubt they even grow it in cambodia laos might be your ticket some areas of myanmar perhaps
  i know the middle east it the ticket but dude fuck going to afghanistan to cop some dope im trying to stay with real asians and not arabs to cut down on danger       yeah i think cambodia is a little bit south of where they grow it i know laos and myanmar do well it just seems with cambodias economy being so shitty they might get it and sell it for cheap i guess laos may be what im looking for heard bribes are much more expensive there though
  milanon here ask me anything  milanos metro will surely work im not 100 about torino but im pretty positive it will work too  btw if you arrive/leave late at night or super early in the morning milan has a system of citybus that substitutes the metro after it close it might be useful  milano is quite an intresting city btw not really turistic but full of cool stuff

ive just read that in some muslim countries namely in the middle east not so much africa or southeast asia men with long hair is illegal or frowned upon ive even read that having western hairstyles is outright illegal in iran    does this normally apply to everyone or do they generally show some lenience to foreigners/tourists
  should be fine then

planning a last minute trip with my gf we decided between nyc or boston how would you compare both these cities in december
  boston slightly less shit
both are too cold
absolutely nyc boston is not even 10 as interesting especially if youre european and youve never been to the us before nyc will be pretty cool and novel boston will just look like a fake and boring copy of an european city    ive seen both during summer so i have no idea about the cold but i guess it depends on what youre used to anyway
  boston isnt fun at all its visually interesting but its a cramped expensive city full of arrogant yuppies and aggressive scum bags thats really about it nyc obviously has more diversity in terms ofeverything honestly i cant think of any reason to go to boston unless youre a revolutionary war history buff or youre an asian high school student who wants to convince their parents to pay for a free trip to scout colleges might be worth it if you really love seafood i for one do not
new york is fucking great to visit the only people who bitch about it are midwest jealousfags who hate on everything thats not rural bumfuck nowhere and those who are born and raised there because native new yorkers complain about everything but as a visitor you dont deal with any of the problems like insane rent prices or the daily commute so the complaints are all invalid    the good things about new york are the excellent food the generally great architecture the sense of being swallowed up by a massive sprawling city without compare worldclass museums history and convenient transit its impossible to be bored there    boston beats out new york in seafood but how many fucking crabs can you eat youll get sick of it and when it comes to general tourism its not even half of what new york is    go to new york ive only been once but it was fucking great american cities generally suck dick but new york is something else i recommend spending an entire day checking out an art museum or two visiting china town for lunch little italy for dinner and dessert and spending at least a day with zero plan just wandering around manhattan and seeing where it takes you
would it be a mistake to visit london and dublin in february is the weather going to make it a bad experience
bbump
  going to be pretty miserable tb h being your rain boots
depends on what you want to do weather wont make a whole heap of difference if all you wanna do is get pissed in temple bar for a weekend and maybe hit up a museum or two     also lately irish weather has either been a fucking storm complete with weather warnings or a heatwave general rule of thumb is if the irish weather isnt to your liking just wait an hour and itll have changed
  its a bad exerience no matter the weather
  you could get lucky but mostly the weather will be awful feb is the worst time weather wise and mood wise people in ireland tend to hibernate a little during the end of january and start of february due to the excessive spending and drinking over christmas holidays that being said therell always be good nights out in dublin and the winter light in the mornings in ireland makes it one of the most beautiful places in the world so if your site seeing try go early for this reason also it gets dark at like 5 in february rather than 10pm in summer
  i live in london february will be grey bleak windy dark and cold have you got to visit then if you could hold off until easter it would be a more enjoyable experience
  would it be a mistake to visit london and dublin in february      both these places are good for bars pubs shopping and museums which are all inside i dont think the potential of bad weather would hurt the trip     february should be fine
we used to have a regular here who used the name tethered aerodyne to post hed dump albums of images from kite festivals    havent seen him post in years im not him i hope hes doing well and still around    anyway heres the kite festival from the north coast of taiwan back in late september ive been meaning to post these for a while but depression

what nonenglish speaking culture would be easiest for an american to adapt to
  pacific island countries theyre already just as fast as americans
  western europe anybody who says anything different is a dumbass
  what if he isnt a muslim though
cape town and the developed parts of sa made me think a lot of the us as a tourist in both countries i have no idea how an actual american would feel
quebec
  stale
  how widespread is afrikaans spoken in the developed areas what are those
  they very much dislike haole i got beaten up in hawaii just for being white
  could you be more specific why do you think its self evident
  france spain portugal italy belgium netherlands switzerland germany denmark switzerland its like asking whats the closest relatives to humans that isnt a neanderthal and not saying chimps its literally the same up until the point of divergence you dont say elephants because they have eyes and an asshole
  quebeckers and islanders and even mexicans are much more close to americans than europeans
  mexico  no
  lol  letting manlets beat you up youre a trollllll
western europe aside probably mexico colombia and urban tracts of latin america the culture isnt jarringly different in the cities and spanish isnt awfully hard to at least become conversationally proficient in     and unlike western europe locals will treat you better for being foreign when their cousin ricardo isnt trying to snatch your backpack from atop a 125cc motorbike
  salty
  hawaiians/islanders arent manlets theyre just fat with lots of muscle as well thats why so many of them play football
iirc south africa has 12 official languages you really only get people who dont speak or refuse to speak any english once you travel way the fuck outside the cities
why do you want to inflict upon yourself the huge pita of living in a nonanglo country its not worth it and besides its very unlikely that there isnt some place in the anglo world that meets the same requirements
  lmao
no unneeded politics please keep it clean
famalam wants to go around the holidays to visit grandmums hometown will be spending most of the time around manila though  compared to travelling on the offseason what can i expect from the holidays
  no unneeded politics please    bad idea anon its like youre using reverse psychology the fuckers are sure to show up for sure now its best if you keep it in the other thread instead       crowds longer waits for transportation the horrible song that says shopping shopping shopping on repeat in sm malls
are there even politics outside of the us these days
  nice try libtard back to  with your ass the fact that cannot be denied is that filipinos smuggle missiles into our country
  is anything at all better during the holidays will i meet other 2nd gens at the bar

    ph expwys are quite fun
  never been on slex but ive taken so many trips on nlex sctex and tplex ive also taken a trip from manila to angeles city while avoiding going on nlex using only jeepneys takes pretty much a whole day
  ive also taken a trip from manila to angeles city while avoiding going on nlex   using only jeepneys  wow i personally dont like jeepneys that much and would rather prefer riding on airconditioned vans youre great on that and once skyway stage 3 is finished going to the north of luzon will be much easier and faster  
  yeah ive done the trip via uv express and bus many more times for me it was fun just learning the routes and trying to think of different ways to get back home bus drivers here used to drive much more dangerously and crazy i hated taking the bus so i wanted alternate options usually i would just take the uv express from sm north edsa to malolos then try to ride to angeles from there if i got there too late i would have to take a jeepney back then the bridge connecting calumpit and apalit was broken so i would have to stop and walk over the foot bridge then wait for the jeep going to san fernando when i got there i had to take another jeep going to angeles and would usually be there past midnight
im going to stop in manila for a few days as a connection between australia and japan november 13th16th way there and then december 18th20th way home what is there to do   i have seen there are a fair few gun ranges which interest me also are these ok for foreigners do you have any recommendations about these  but other than that im not sure what to do  i just booked the extra days staying there because they added almost nothing to flight costs over having a 510 hour stopover so now trying to figure out how to fill them
any recommendations for really hot prostitutes best escort service
help im stuck in masbate again
  what is there to do  go to places like makati batangas clark go shopping eat filipino food meet other foreigners etc  also are these ok for foreigners  yes      what happened this time anon also arent you the anon who married a filipina in masbate in the previous ph threads
good afternoon yall
  i hit jollibee today too my wifes mother needed to go to philhealth to take care of something so we were stuck in a mall for hours i ate the double amazing aloha always a good bet also had some of my wifes spicy fried chicken that she didnt finish    observation jollibee fried chicken is of better quality than both mcdonalds and kfc their burger patties kinda suck though they have some great burgers anyway the cheesy bacon mushroom and amazing aloha are my favorites all the extra toppings dressing cheese etc makes for a more tasty burger than you can get at mcdonalds even though the meat is lacking on the other hand despite their chicken not being as good the new mcdonalds spicy chicken has the edge on jollibees the flavor is better jollibee workers also tend to lump the powder on one small area of the piece of chicken youll handle it and end up with a bunch of the powder stuck to your hands and way too much on your tongue too
  so i wrote in the other thread looking for apartment prices close to the malls in makati 400500 per month short time stay 12 months    seems like 400 is doable but it is difficult are there any other areas in manila that are similar for my purposes needs safety tidyish gym in building good internet malls office girls on lunch break
  kamusta
  also arent you the anon  yeaa  i went back to the uk for some months now im back out here
  ill likely stay in makati as it is close to the airport seems to have a fair few of the gun ranges i want to visit and hotels seems decent priced is there any specific things youd recommend doing there other than shopping/eating  not really sure what id go shopping for but ill likely visit the giant shopping malls just to see what its like compared to home
  this pic made me confident philipines is the right place to go to score thicc sea girls
  you should also try greenwichs fried chicken its a mix of jollibee and mcdonalds also mang inasal bbq chicken is also pretty great      consider renting a condo instead it would be 2k  4k php but you do get acess to all the amenities and privileges smdc jazz for example has a mall in the lobby floor       glad to see your doing fine anon      recreational activites perhaps theres a kart racing circuit in makati if your interested in that
  yeah there are a few shooting ranges in makati and theres some in quezon city too i went to commander shooting range with my ex who was a foreigner and it went well its somehow more expensive for a foreigner than for a local but the two of us cost almost p3k with pistol 9mm forgot how many bullets was it and a shotgun with 6 shells but the paper you shoot at is pretty thin unlike the one in armscor makati
  consider renting a condo instead  condo  apartment yes it was something akin to jazz i had in mind but i want a monthly price ideally not exceeding 400 usd p/m
  how much of the philippines are in english
  majority of the country can understand and speak english pretty well except for the remote areas like batanes perhaps
  2k  4k php  for how long thats only like 80 bucks
has anyone been to ticao island  ive been told its full of rebels and not safe but there seems to be plenty of people who visit the resort there at least
  per month      its safe
  4k monthly near makati thats unrealistic af unless you mean usd do you happen to have any examples of these
  is that james franco
    lol php2k4k per month is not real he probably meant usd even a fucking dormitory where you sleep with 24 other people in one room wont give it to you for 24k per month
  i dont see james franco in that pic if youre referring to the guy modelling the phone hes a local model/actor
      meant 20k  40k php per month my bad
  something like this for example
  1 year contract  that wont work but at least it is a baseline to keep in mind
  some unit owners are flexible with their contracts managed to get 3 mos for p25k per month sm jazz aswell
  that is sort of acceptable no extra utilities fees whats the bandwidth like do all jazz units have balconies
  whats the bandwidth like  horrible terrible atrocious this isnt a unit problem its a philippines problem
an apartment near the beach in mexico is only 2 to 3 hundred a month
  utilities fees comes with the p25k a month im paying also subscribed to pldt fiber so 20mbps download and 20mbps upload not all jazz units have balconies those that dont have balconies tend to be less expensive like p17k to p22k
  actual mexico or mexico city pampanga
  bandwidth here isnt as bad as it used to be i live in the middle of nowhere and i dont even have running water electric lines are the only infrastructure here i still get 20mbit downloads on lte just a few years ago the best i had was 5mbit cable in pampanga if i lived there now i could get 25mbit fiber for the same price    if youre really going to be staying in jazz you could always go to the mall on the bottom floor and use the sm free wifi limited to one hour per day you can get more if you use multiple sim cards  macs to download things at 60mbit thats what i do since the internet where im staying is only lte and therefore capped whenever i go to the mall i download a bunch of stuff from my seedbox onto my phones sd card
  mexico city pampanga  the fuck
  its not mexico city just mexico its next to san fernando sm pampanga is there right on the very edge of town
  why on earth is there a town in the philippines named mexico
  actual mexico i mean   sorry confused this thread with the cheap places for winter thread  i am looking for the cheapest winter beach vacations
  so what is the cap on lte how many gb  not into downloading too many things 12gb per day will suffice whats more important is ulspeed of about 3 mbps or faster
  on prepaid they give you 1gb for 3 days for about 1 usd 50 pesos it also includes 12 gb per day for youtube 1 on smart/sun 2 on globe     in manila the speeds are excellent on both im fond of sun since its on the smart network which has the edge on globe speed wise in the provinces sun has lots of cheap promos with good value the one i use is 200 pesos per month unlimited texts to all networks unlimited facebook whatsapp viber etc basically all messaging apps and also 2 hours of calls to smart sun or pldt numbers but globe is kinda considered the young peoples network you might have better luck with it if youre trying to pick up girls
  not liking the sm jingle  cmon anon  
  that one is alright its the christmas one thats horrible they have a version on youtube but its not nearly as obnoxious as the one they play in the malls 
  oh jesus thats horrible  so uh apart from not going around christmas how can i get away from christmas
so smart decided to do a nationwide upgrade today without announcing it my internet from them has been down since this morning i had to buy globe load to get online and the connection is total trash quote from twitter    smart agent may nationwide upgrade po tayo kaya hindi po kayo nakaka connect sa data service by 9 pm pa po sya babalik    theyre doing the typical routine for all the people sending messages to smartcares which include lots of f bombs customer service from corporations in this country is the absolute worst    from what ive heard everything is still up in manila though      go stay at a nice resort somewhere youll still see some christmas stuff but youll be away from the nonsense
    in the metro none    if you want to experience proper filipino holiday season go to the provinces
    probably pagpag its leftover food from restaurants eaten by the majority of the filipino poor in the metro    pagpag means to vigorously remove dirt on an item you could probably guess why its called like that
    living in this country is like riding a rollercoaster blindfolded but since the moment youre born and you dont know when it will end
  kart racing circuit in makati  awesome thats something i have been wanting to do at home but this sounds a lot cheaper anyway so ill do it there      i had seen commander from my googling so thank you for a first hand experience of foreigners being alright there  ill have to look at armscor too then if they have better targets as id like to keep the paper if possible i have a collection from different ranges ive been to with different weapons its fun to look and see which guns i do well with
  i need someone to tell me this is not true   you mean like food off peoples plates that they did not eat
  i need someone to tell me this is not true   this is true   you mean like food off peoples plates that they did not eat  yes but like  said only the poorest of the poor in metro manila does this
any dangerous parts of manila to avoid any beach areas or jungle i should check out if i get sick of the city pls respond
  any dangerous parts of manila to avoid  tondo and slum areas    any beach areas or jungle i should check out if i get sick of the city pls respond  laiya nasugbu taal and palawan
  only the poorest of the poor  so they are not going to try to sell this stuff to a white guy r right
  yeah not going to happen unless you go looking for it    also a shout out to whoever the loser weeb is that shitposted with this ip sm free wifi in rosales pangisinan on /a/ and got it warned
this is why i recommended the sm wifi for downloading
  nice you can spoof your mac address and keep getting free wifi on sm on ayala malls you cant anymore since they ask for your phone number
  sm uses sms verification too but you can verify multiple times with the same phone numbers and different mac addresses iphone users will never know this freedom
the only thing the philippines is good for is sex filipinas are good at being whores and thats about it fill their pussies up with cum drop loads on their face accidentally put it in their ass treat the philippines as that old sock you used to cum into when you were a teenager masturbating in the basement
  is this real or just some incel fantasy    i want to go to the philipines but im afraid that its just some sex country without any actual things to do there besides sex
  unless theyre jailbroken      just some incel fantasy he probably only went to angeles for sex the philippines has a lot to offer
  i can tell youve never been here if you have you probably just stuck to angeles or similar places like the other guy said you sound like a boomer not the 30 year old kind either the kind that still pays for home phone service and reads newspapers    go to a country with stunning natural scenery mountains volcanoes beautiful beaches diving opportunities and best of all its cheap  lol its only good for sex    this aint it chief
how much should i budget for 2 weeks in philipines this december excluding flight tickets    i want to experience a lot in those 2 weeks but i have absolutely no idea about the costs involved think comfortable hotel rooms but not luxurious
  funny that they use mbps wonder if they mean mbps megabit or mbps megabyte both are pretty fast tho thanks for the screencap
  megabyte is exactly 8x the speed of megabit theres an extremely noticable difference
  theres too many variables involved for that where are you flying from you should start with that skyscanner google flights etc but that also begs the question where are you flying to luzon visayas mindano theres just way too much here to give a guesstimate without at least a rudimentary plan
  excluding flight    i just want to hang out at some beaches see lots of nature and maybe experience some nightlife    but ive no idea if it would be 50/day or 300/day since ive never been    i dont want to use hostels but i dont mind cheap hotels as long as they arent absolute poverty shacks flashpacker style stuff maybe even fly domestically to see different islands i dont know just wondering what scale of budgeting i should think in
  its megabyte the sm mall wifi can reach up to 100mbit you dont always get that speed i think it depends on the location and the number of other people using it today in rosales it fluctuated more than it usually did it never dropped below 30mbit but it was as low as that and as high as 90mbit its a saturday and the mall was super busy usually when i go on weekdays its much more steady another thing to factor in is that its downloading from a gigabit seedbox located in the netherlands
  if i were you id set it up so you can spend a few days of your trip at fancy resorts also in trendier parts of manila in a nice hotel so you can hit clubs and if you decide to bring a girl back to your room she doesnt judge you for taking her to something like sogo consider those 300 days id also look for whatever cool places you want to experience maybe stick to luzon at first get a good plan for transportation in place there is info about bus routes and costs going from manila online if you are looking for hookers and end up spending time in angeles you can factor that in too going anywhere north from there dau bus terminal is going to be slightly cheaper and take less time thats going to be the hardest part of it all really figuring out your transportation part of your trip could be spent stuck in traffic if youre really unlucky
  yes i know i was referring to the fact that that speed 8 megabyte per second is fast enough for all my purposes it would have been fast enough even at 8mbps       cool i guess all the coffeeshops in the malls have their own inhouse wifi do you see a lot of nomads spending multiple hours in there everywhere else i live in sea i get no problems at all when i sit down for 6 hours and spend 10 bucks on food and coffees
  i guess all the coffeeshops in the malls have their own inhouse wifi   yes  do you see a lot of nomads spending multiple hours in there   yes and mostly in makati malls
    the coffee shop wifi is usually pretty trash compared to the mall wifi though it would be like 3mbit average better to use the mall wifi to do all your downloading change macs on your rooted phone/pc to get more than one hour in sm and use those wifi networks for lighter activities its good to get a pocket lte wifi modem too one of those will run you about 20usd and its 1usd per gb for data
  cool actually the upload speeds are what is most relevant for me i need to ul about 500mb a day i can spend a lot of time on it though so most will be done from my apartment
  on the sm wifi i think you can upload just as fast as you can download lte upload speeds arent bad here either depends on how congested the network is in your specific area though    if you get the smart lte modem here pic related you can unlock it to use both networks i have it and it works great on globe the unlock code is the same on every modem i did it using a tutorial on youtube
  tutorial is here     
  thx anon appreciated
do they still block pornhub
  probably but even the most basic ass free vpn will get you to it see     usually im using ssh tunneling with a sun sim theres a hack that allows you to do it with a very cheap promo 50 pesos for 10 days of access to chat apps can get 3gb per day with it you just spoof your connection as a chat app and you get through since all my traffic is going to singapore no porno is ever blocked you just cant post on 4chan with that shit i tend to switch back and forth depending on my needs
    is it being blocked i know youporn is but i have been able to access the site a few days ago
  it still is
  with the sole exception of salcedo district everywhere i went in manila some mindanao pick pocket hordes emerged from the side streets or a 711 and tried to steal my phone/wallet   i also had issues with taxis dumping me blocks away from destination were here you can walk that way and it was a complete slum sidestreet he was dumping me off at in the middle of the night     other than that hassle there was no security issues except whenever i looked in the local paper some foreign run hotel got robbed usually run by koreans or chinese i only stayed at philippine run hotels with security out front i also had a really good local meal once and decided to tip 10 usd for a table of 5 people which is 500 pesos or so and the idiot waitress turned around and started making fun of us in very loud tagalog what fools we were with money causing all street junkys within distance to immediate congregate at our table and harass us       never touch street food with few exceptions if youre near a mall or office and you see one of those official food carts with a lineup of salary men waiting to get lunch and you can see them cooking and how they handle food safely or youre around a beach and some guy there is fanning a big ass fresh fish on a grill everywhere else is selling rat meat or god knows what they picked out of the trash thats been sitting in the sun all day with flies around it baking that special food poisoning for you western and foreign food for the most part is also pure garbage so just eat the local food
my vpn seems to be extremely limited on globe homesurf although i sometimes get fast speeds early in the morning but right now im getting 4mbps without the vpn but only 05 mbps with the vpn  is it likely they are doing some kind of throttling  anyone have experience getting around this kind of thing would an ssl tunnel help
  your vpn is a tunnel if you are having issues it is due to your vpn and not your connection try vpngate in combination with softether free mainly cracked servers and see if you still have the same issue
where/how would you meet some cute young girls that would want to fuck a white guy  girls like 14yo legal age there is 12 and 14 in my country so fully legal because while it is legal here its also not overly socially acceptable im 19 but fuck do you i like the bodies of 1315 year old girls so much better than girls my age honestly 1416 would probably look quite young in phillipines right  or am i more likely to mugged/stabbed trying to do this
  dont come here and think its okay to do this shit        if you think theyre not going to argue that any sexual contact with a minor was coerced youre a fucking moron this is the philippines even if you didnt know a girl was underage the corrupt cops here will be on you like flies on shit go look at a video of what the jails look like here       what country are you connecting through singapore tends to be the best
  this is a legit question between thailand and the philippines which one has the best cost x quality prostitution service straight  gay
  fair call if someone did see me with a young girl and felt they could get some money by trying to fuck me over they would wouldnt they  i just have a long stopover and the only thing i have heard of the phillipines is the idea that older guys go there to fuck little kids like thailand is for ladyboys and kids so i looked at aoc and thought maybe i could get some 14yos not too questionably but you are right its probably a bad idea  man how good would a country be if it were cheap like an sea country low aoc and high prostitution count like an sea country but without the high chance of getting mugged or stabbed by thugs or fucked in the ass by cops that can do whatever they want
  18 year old girls here look and behave like 14 year olds anyway
    thanks senpaitachi  i tried the vpngate and it is still slow there and lots of different countries inc singapore and hongkong vpn over stunnel is definitely a bit faster 1mbps instead of 05 mbps but still nowhere near normal speed  oh well i guess this is /trv/ not tech support ill go see if my vpn provider knows anything  but globe is really annoying
  idea that older guys go there to fuck little kids  the truth of the meme is that old guys go there to get with 20 year olds  stay out of jail anon
whats a good sedan to buy here in the philippines

i banged a filipino then sent her nudes to her mom and dad and brothers and everyone on her friends list was pretty funny it was like 2 years ago she told me i was wanted in the philippines which i laughed at now i kinda want to go but seeing as durte is there it seems kinda sketchy theres no way shes serious right
  post the nudes
  you had access to her friend list
  i did once we hooked up we added one another on facebook she stayed with me like a week she tried stealing a few hundred bucks from me so she got dropped off at a gas station       ill get banned again blue board and all
    hahaa this right ere boiiiii
  why would you do that
  she tried stealing money from me
  also i was really drunk when i did it
  ill get banned again blue board and all  post on a different board and link it
  its just you
  is she underage post them faggot
    fine ill link them give me time to find them and post them i might get ban hammered anyways because she really didnt have tits like that but she was idk probably 2021 it might be tomorrow before they come out ive got to wade through some pretty cringy drunk messages so i hate you guys for it
  but seeing as durte is there it seems kinda sketchy  if you  dont buy drugs  you wont have any problem with police  if you  dont get into trouble with some local drug dealers like snitching  you wont get killed by them as simple as that
is it true that ilonggo women are the hottest in ph
  
  tondo  most of tondo can be quite comfy at daytime if youre the kind of person fascinated shophouses scattered along narrow streets and alleys theres also vendors there that sell very good kutsinta topped with dulce de leche and putongbumbong tondo is a lowclass area not necessarily a poorfag shanty town one can compare it to favelas except less dangerous  it shouldnt be visited at night though as thats when the bad guys wake up

is uber a thing in manila  is it a good/bad idea to use if like not being mugged  is it cheaper than taxis
any on have any particularly different or odd things you recommend to do in manila or things very specific to the area  kind of like going to a soapland when in tokyo or a ladyboy when in thailand   ok ok i know both of those are sex tourism related but im not just looking for that   the other thing i can think of is shooting guns when you go to any sea country for us aussies and uk etc that cant use guns easy like americans   so things that arent the normal go see the sites of the city and try the normal foods i will do those but im seeking some more outside the box suggestions  cheers
  is uber a thing in manila  it was until grab bought all of ubers se asia operations  is it a good/bad idea to use if like not being mugged  yes  is it cheaper than taxis  a bit more expensive      do recreational activities around the metro
  so you use grab then not uber or did they keep the name but are just owned by grab  so its more expensive thats odd isnt the only point of uber the fact it was cheaper
  recreational activities is kind of a bit very vague  like i said im gonna go see the sites that would be on a normal top ten in manila so im just hoping for some more random suggestions or stuff i might not be able to do normally guns and hookers just being the two things i can think of that fit my criteria which is why i mentioned those  so what recreational activities would you suggest i did see go karting mentioned earlier in the thread so i might do that but i have 4 days so i got time for more things
  uber is gone in sea as grab bought their operations only grab now and no uber  
  hmm interesting  so would you recommend using a taxi or a grab
anyone from australia flown to the philippines on philippine airlines just wondering about their baggage policy  im stopping over for a few days on the way to japan their site says 2x23kg bags for flights between japan and philippines but just states 25kg for australia pacific technically flights to philippines so can that be 2 bags that add up to 25kg most flights seem to be max 23kg per bag and usually specify that its 1 bag so this being higher than the normal 23kg and also not stating how many bags it is makes me think that 2 light bags would be alright but of course that could easily be wrong so im hoping someone here has traveled with them and knows the answer
  grab have better security you have their name and vehicle number in the grand scheme of things its like 1 dollar more in pricing
  ill use them then there wont be many times im going too far so the extra cost shouldnt add up to much at all but the extra security is nice  thanks for the help
  pls respond
  heres one  
  grab or uber is usually a bit more expensive than regular taxis they exist for convenience and safety mostly      are you into the hobbit theres a place in manila called hobbit house thats the hobbitrelated restaurant obviously and most of their employees are midgets i guess there are also the cat/dog cafes if you like and manila ocean park national museum for free entrance or maybe theres a fee i cant remember but its pretty cheap if there is that you could go to or ride a bamboo bike around intramuros there are also places like mystery manila and breakout where you solve mysteries and shit better if with friends if youre pretty active you could do indoor wallclimbing in climb central or ice skating in sm megamall or sm mall of asia food bazaars like mercato look up their facebook page they have schedules if youre feeling adventurous go outside of manila and see if youd like to have a tour around villa escudero they do various activities there like riding carabaodrawn cart eating near waterfalls etc idk those are the things that i could think of right now
  ive travelled from aus to ph via philippine airlines but only had 1 checked in luggage the only time ive experienced this was with jetstar from japan to phils usually though most airlines allow 2 checked in baggage as long as the aggregate weight and dimensions of the 2 bags will not exceed the provided measurements try checking this one out 
  national museum isnt free but the cost is pretty negligent  beyond that i believe students get a discount i carry around my old university id on the grounds that nobody gives a shit if youre a student or not so long as you look the part
  yes and no  sometimes taxis will take circuitous routes to boost the meter sometimes a taxi even a proper one will try to charge you a flat rate for a destination rather than use the meter and this can be a good thing to pay because usually theyll drive like a bat out of hell to get you there so they can charge some other guy a flat rate as well but that flat rate will be more than a grab
  thank you
    thanks guys you cleared up the uber/grab situation and i appreciate it ill probably use them a bit as i can easily do it with my hotel wifi and have someone waiting for me to take me
  yeah thats what i thought too that most full service airlines have a 2 bag allowance so how this on is stated still makes me think they do ive tried to find the answer in their faq as well as the documents like what you linked but nowhere makes it any clearer sadly thank you for the link anyway though  they have a line to call for reservations so ill probably just give them a ring as i figure asking questions about your current ticket reservation is applicable for that phone line
  if you can use the new p2p buses the routes arent many usually just between malls and some airport routes but theyre the best transport in manila  you see theyre buses normal buses they pick up passengers at a fixed point and drop them off at fixed points like normal buses do this is new this is revolutionary this is like the future if we were currently living in the god damn 60s
  ube express is a good one
i really dont understand why people in these threads insist on using grab for every trip they need to make here if you are a tourist on a short term stay its probably a good idea its the most fool proof option but if youre going to stay here long term and are going from one part of metro manila to another its a big waste of money you should familiarize yourself with where the bus stops are and how much it costs vs grab the p2p buses are obviously good but even the regular air conditioned buses will get you where you need to go 50 or more cheaper than grab will
  hobbit restaurant  carabaodrawn cart  thank you mate these are the sort of different things i was looking for im sure maybe somewhere else has similar but they definitely seem fairly like you can only do it here kinda thing  also all the other suggestions are very good too more normal but i will add them to my list of things to do  thanks
is this good
  only 19000 tourists  good too many people on this island in general  presenting hotel reservation slips  no problem with that  reduced hotel rooms  just means you need to be out earlier or wait a little  no smoking and alchohol on beach  ah would be nice with a san mig  banning laboracay  never cared about this  diving will be temporarily prohibited  kinda bad  water activites suspended temporarily  also not so good  dining by beach prohibited  no problem  fireworks only until 9pm  all fine  no electric lights on beachfront  dont care  sand castles will be regulated  those castles were nice tho  souvenir shops and hawkers will be banned  great  fire dancing will be prohibited  ah what a shame  casinos will be banned  noice  hot coal roasting will be banned  fuck nooooooooooooo
  sand castle making will be regulated  fuck this
  pagpag means to vigorously remove dirt on an item  i like how they have a special short word for it its like how cabriolet got reduced to car or velocipede to bike that sort of treatment is reserved for words that are so fucking common that they need shortening it kind of speaks to whats important in their society  dumpster diving to eat garbage      its quite real one of my relatives was 70something when he married some 20yo nursing student from the philippines he was a miserable old bastard who had driven away all the rest of his family too had a new family with her and she stuck with him until he finally croaked fifteen or so years later    the flip economy is a little better now than it was then but not by much chicks are still willing to fuck anything that moves to get out ffs look at the posts about them eating garbage see above thailand and vietnam are similar
  lets be honest our public transport system here is not exactly what youd want to take specially weekday rush hours its just hell whether train bus or jeepney perhaps on the weekends its not as bad those people staying long term mostly live walking distance or really close to where they workassuming thats what theyre here for long term as for those shortterm if you take public transpo from one city to the other you will be wasting time stuck in traffic or in line instead of using that time to do other productive stuff unlike public transpo grab can take other routes also for the convenience and safety and the fee they pay for grab is immaterial to them     tldr stop hating those who prefer to use grab cause nobody would want to get through the hell of commuting in metro manila
  no because it means ill have to compete with other tourists overflowing from cancelled boracay plans  the best thing about boracay was it contained the plebs
  to be fair to that anon the inflation of grabs rates are crazy this year alone
  best to rent an island to yourself if you plan to do so try the hundred islands is you want to keep in mind that se asia countries are pretty conservative and we have public indecency laws here hence renting a private island if you really want to
      original guy who asked about baggage allowance from australia  i ended up being able to call the airline and they confirmed the 25kg can be more than 1 bag figured id post here in case any other aussies wanted to know
so i saw earlier in the thread that grab took over uber in philippines do they run grab eats instead of uber eats do these type of services menulog etc have a presence in manila
  yeah since they have it monopolized now their rates are double than the ones you would normally pay for a regular taxi tbqh but i guess safety and convenience has its price
  yeah they now have grabfood but foodpanda also exists which does the same thing
  sweet thanks mate will likely put one or both into use while im there
  lake sebu is lovely but the long travel time to get there is eh    which part of cotabato are you going north south cotabato city
i wish i was immortal and bulletproof so i could explore the slums
  what slums are you thinking of slums like tondo can be fine at daytime though you should be careful still as small children might snatch you
  any of them really i love those kinds of dense windy towns with thousands of buildings and people everywhere    but i stick out like a white beacon and would either get robbed killed have 12 year olds propositioning me or some combination of the three
  getting propositioned robbed and then killed all by the same 12 year old  nice    but fuck you the part about the 12 year olds now makes me want to into the slums my death is on your hands
  local man killed and robbed in philippine slums by gang of 12 year old street girls   he was found in a dumpster covered in his own semen clutching a tattered copy of girls for m
  but really thatd be the way to go out
  dont actually do this
  i know i know i will begrudgingly stop myself maybe when im old and ready to die ill go there and let it happen
apparently according to usersubmitted data on numbeo philippines is on averagein terms of actually settling down and living there cheaper than all other big 5 asean countries some groceries like tomato potato onion and lettuce are more expensive and internet and electricity are aids but high tier restaurants transport clothes and real estate are much cheaper apparently    how true is this is it really one of the cheapest countries there
  before the train law and the taxes that duterte implemented then yes but right now philippines cost of living is pretty high 
  pretending to not be that flip redditor who needs to make everything political  before the train law and the taxes  nigger the reason prices went up was because of global fuel prices going upph has one of the highest fuel importation rates in the world and the nfa rice storages was mysteriosuly depleted in 2018 train had very little impact and its pure misinfo to put the blame on it  in dollar values the prices havent changed that much actually
  pretending to not be that flip redditor who needs to make everything political  im no flip redditor who needs to make everything political here im only stating facts that train and taxes made cost of living in the ph more costly than it was before  train had very little impact  you have to be a duterte fanatic or someone who doesnt live in the ph to think it had little impact  
whenever i see pictures of philippines cities and the way people dress even some of their tv shows it reminds me so fucking much of brazil its uncanny even our soon to be president will be similar to duterte i know this is a no politics thread but i had to point that out   anyone who has experienced living in both countries should elaborate on whether they really feel that similar
  im no flip redditor  yes you are you even write the same way as you do in /asea/
  yeah they look the same to me all those factory reject shitty tshirts and shorts on people and the complete lack of relevant internationally viable contemporary culture no offence intended  and the death squads are straight out of brazilian police strategy in both places the jungle is full of mercury pouring gold panners and illegal gunsmiths
as i sit here watching my favorite hockey team win a game it was recorded this morning on pirated satellite tv i have a few observations of my own to add to the last few posts    most philippine political shit has little to do with the people coming to these threads bitching about the cost of living being so high isnt relevant unless youre a filipino getting paid filipino wages it doesnt apply to us so please dont make this thread /asean/ lite im currently living off of 500 per month my wife is also selling load now which brings a little bit of extra income in for daily expenses there is no fucking way i could do this back home even with all the inflation and laughable failure of dutertes half baked plans and empty promises for reform of work contracts etc im still living more comfortably than i would back home with more money    on the subject of brazil they also have a culture of hacking the mobile isps that mirrors the one in the philippines when i was learning how to set that stuff up myself i got the info i needed from a brazilian blog in portuguese it was easier for me to read than the tagalog tutorials
does anyone know what the go is with viagra in philippines can i get some over the counter anywhere  i will be visiting manila and the area for a short time and while my reasons for visiting definitely arent majorly focused on sex tourism i do plan to go to a few clubs/bars and try my luck with locals or get an escort if that doesnt pan out  from an accident involving a large hit to the general crotch area i have some amount of erectile dysfunction so i like to have some viagra for just in case my dick doesnt feel like playing that day   cant get any at home because i cant get a prescription due to some stupid nonsense and cant get it online because i leave in like 2 days    tldr erectile dysfunction from accident wanna fuck some girls from clubs/bars in manila wanting to know about over the counter viagra in manila
  they sell it on the streets in the sex tourist areas is it safe will it work i have no idea to be totally honest with you you might have luck getting it otc though my wife managed to do so for birth control not every pharmacy will allow that type of thing but weve had good luck with mercury drug locations you might have to try more than one ymmv
  from our friends over at leddit    without prescription but it depends some places are strict and some not so strict you should try to make friends at various pharmacies or make friends with foreigners who can buy them for you since these places dont tend to question foreigners as much as locals weird right when it comes to prescription drugs    at least that has been my experience i was able to get quite a lot of prescription drugs over the counter without question in davao at watsons mercury and hb1    i dont recommend you try at watsons though they tend to be a little more fancy and strict its all about mercury if the first one you hit doesnt oblige its happened to my wife before just go to another one theyre all over the place in manila
  be careful anon duterte fanboys in this thread wont like this comment of yours
i want a 3045 year old chubby/fatter woman to pamper me and being motherly while i call her mommy    do you think philippines is a good place for me to get this
  im sure you can find one try dateinasiacom
    yeah id certainly question the street corner drug dealers quality so might skip them  awesome ill try mercury then even if i have to try a few thats no big deal spend a couple hours in so i dont have to worry the rest of the stay  thanks for the help mate
  you have to be a duterte fanatic or someone who doesnt live in the ph to think it had little impact  ironically the same guy that you linked an article from 2018 april also wrote this one in september      yes train undoubtedly contributed to inflation as was expected but it is in no way the sole culprit for this and actually dont contribute as much to inflation as you imply  he even argues that rising oil prices that has actually been on the rise since 2016 is one of the largest culprits  one study showed that back in 2016 we imported as much as 94 of our oil requirements visàvis thailand which only imported 70 indonesia 41 vietnam 20 and malaysia 10    theres also the deprecation of the peso vs usd which doesnt go very well hand in hand with importation however its a double edged sword in the short term its going to be kinda painful due to what i mentioned above regarding imports but on the other hand it will make philippines cheaper for foreign investors and their products cheaper for export too  also the increase in imports are mostly attributed to a long overdue infraupgrade this is just temporary though and will not be going on forever and in a few years the trade gap might reverse  and of course the rice crisis that happened where nfa storages somehow went empty all of a sudden i honestly hope the nfa gets abolished which has been hinted because its full of absolutely incompetent retards who think government controlled supply will do good in a free market and not just letting traders import unhindered themselves    in the end train did contribute to inflation but its far from the only suspect to blame had neither of the other things happened we would probably see no higher inflation than 4 and without train we would still likely see inflation up to 45

    didnt meant to reply
anyone own a scooter in metro manila the traffic seems safer than other sea countries because it barely moves then again some bikers angkas ride like absolute lunatics getting tired of grab taking 2 hours to go 5km expensive too
has anyone been to boracay since it reopened  it seems like getting an airbnb there or staying anywhere other than a large hotel or resort will be impossible  where and when do they check your booking
  he traffic seems safer than other sea countries because it barely moves  statistically philippines has the highest risk of death from motorbikes in the region  but again this is based on accidents on all registered motorbikes in the philippines   according to data from lto which was last updated in 2013 stating philippines had 4 million registered motorbikes philippines has one of the lowest motorbike ownership rates in southeast asia and even less than most european countries that sounds almost impossible to me and thats supported by the fact that sales from 20092012 is almost as much as amount of motorbikes registered in 2013 it truly tells me that a significant part of motorbikes are not accounted for     some argue that theres actually 1415 million motorbikes right now so the fatality rate is actually slightly lower than thailand and vietnam
  according to data from lto which was last updated in 2013 stating philippines had 4 million registered motorbikes philippines has one of the lowest motorbike ownership rates in southeast asia and even less than most european countries  yeah that honesly sound like pure bs i mean philippines has generally less motorbikes than rest of asia but its still significantly many 4 million is way too few

  if youre looking for prostitutes thailand has a much larger scene but if youre white i dont see why you would ever need a prostitute in the phillipines unless youre into some messed up fetishes
  bdsm
      its anecdotal but i have been to ho chi minh and am in manila right now while the traffic is that good old do whatever the fuck you want thats so sea it also absolutely looks safer than everything i saw in ho chi minh every few seconds there someone nearly got hit or something whereas its less often here
  the train law was ill timmed they probably didnt consider external factors  think about it we have been going through oil prices hikes for years now but none of them compared to the damage on what we have today and thats because of train law it adds to the burden
  they fucked up the train law when they put extra taxes on the oil    the whole nation relies on oil and we are now just feeling the domino effect    it will only get worse in the coming years since there will be an additional tax increase on oil in the next 2 to 3 years
  sugar in everything is a common habit here deep fried fish/meat is a daily staple for the masses especially the urban poor were not a nation of obese people but yes our diet habits are very suspect
  nah data suggest you have about the same death rate as thais and only slightly higher than viets difference is that most of you die from diseases and such that could otherwise be treated thats not the case for thais and viets probably because they have better healthcare accessibility  if you look at data from each provinces you see that most females live to 75 but some of the less developed provinces its under 70

   complete lack of relevant internationally viable contemporary culture  you are completely wrong about brazil here not only do they export a ton of pop music they also produce most of their own culture rather than import american culture to the extent of countries like the philippines youre focusing too much on your own experience
  butthurt brasilian  not even sepultura is good and that was another century i bet if i had a listen to your exported pop music it would be cringy af so you dont import american culture so those giant rock in rio events have nobody attending huh

  hey got a question for you when you were in hcm did you see alot of graffiti like tagging and where there alot of littering there too
am i wrong to say that there has been a surge of ejeepneys and etrikes or have you noticed such
i have a maximum 22 day stay possible in ph because i am a wagecuck and i hate myself  i am trying to make an itinerary for where i will travel and it looks all good so far only problem is that i really want to visit iloilo to try out the famous batchoy la paz but its really difficult to squeeze in a trip there without severely affecting the other trips  so i think of skipping iloilo all together this time but i really wonder if any of you have tried the authentic batchoy la paz with the proper broth miki noodles and topping in the following cities/destinations manila cebu boracay puerto princesa el nido zamboanga vigan
  iirc theyre trying to phase out diesel vehicles for public transport which means old jeepneys and trikes are on the way out there was a protest or other on the matter some years ago
  litter first thought was yeah a fair bit but honestly thinking about it while the place certainly has lots of junk sitting around and is clearly very messy i dont actually remember that much litter so idk mate  tagging i didnt notice much of but honestly i easily could be forgetting it was a while ago now but i feel like there wasnt  all in all i cant give a great answer because my memory clearly didnt hold onto those things like it did the everyone almost killing each other every 3 seconds while driving/riding
  tbf there are plenty of areas in hcm that reminds me of manila and i am talking about shitty areas theres plenty of littering and some amounts of graffiti in the shitty areas
  not really they come and they go so fast i dont think they last a year due to unsustianbility    althought id rather them phase out trycicles and pedicabs as well they add to the shithole vibe and the lack or road dicipline
  there are quite indeed alot of similarities after all both good and bad actually most sea cities has the following problems    has areas where sidewalks are nonexistent or swallowed by businesses  has littering problems  has problems with vendor taking up huge space of the road or sidewalk  huge ass traffic during rush hours  infrastructure is clearly third world tier  overpopulated    in terms of hcm and manila the differences are probably that hcm has significantly less visible poverty better road infrastructure slightly lower crime rate and slightly less congestion due to the   also their buildings tend to be more vivid and most of their shops has powerful color signs that could give someone epilepsy and vietnam seems to have an universal traffic sign system that matches the rest of the world  whereas manila has much more visible poverty lots of buildings are unpainted thus dull and grey and some of the business signs look worn out but at least you wont have epilepsy as for crime its obvious that its slightly higher due to the nature of poverty with low class scum choosing to rob other unfortunate people lots of roads are simply just concrete with no markings and intersections seems rather plain and all road signs are inconsistent with one another as lgu officials seems to favor their cousins shitty signfactory  as for congestion manila clearly has more cars thus the traffic is much more aids   but knowing that vietnam overall has a surge in car sales makes me very worried as i expect the traffic to be even worse considering their cities are more made for motorbikes
first time checking out /trv/  find a philippines thread birthplace of my mother  ive been there before but wasnt really impressed  ctrlf mosquito  0 results    so like why would you want to travel to flipland is it about the cocks you guys just want to see cocks going at it with each other right they even put cocks on tv ads is it really worth wading through all the mosquitoes and cigarette smoke to see cocks
  your biggest mistake is buying a samsung    all the galaxy phones are ripoffs with still more problems than any new iphone released today    do yourself a favour and get yourself any phone thats not a samsung
  ok numale
  trisiks should only be confined in smaller streets not onto main roads  pedicabs should be removed altogether as most of them are fucking ugly and niggerish as they use bmx style bikes or rather replace them with padyaks which has a much more asian vibe than these ugly rusty bmxes  these are generally found in visayas and mindanao
  that actually looks pretty nice would love to see pedicab drivers opt for this instead and also better dresscode than dirty polluted tshirt and ripped shorts i know they are poor but most clothes are dirt cheap there either way and ive seen legit poor people dressing better
for what reason are philippine cities atleast manila and cebu not so popular tourist destinations  is it the lack of street food variety i mean i know of plenty of dishes that could be served on the street that could add some competition to the currently extremely saturated streetfood market which mostly consists of something barbecued fried or unfresh food from karinderia  these are  lugaw  satti  mami  batchoy  bulalo  and theres surely more but cba to list  yes some of them are sold along the streets but not in good enough numbers for tourists to take note
  manila has numerous other reasons for nobody to want to go there besides the availability of quality street food that isnt toxic for starters the shit public transit the nightmare traffic the levels of pollution because of said traffic the expensive cost of living and general dysfunctional state of everything ect ect    i dont think you can run a proper food cart there without paying a ton of bribes to city officials and running the risk of the toxic carineria owners just firebombing your cart to get rid of you
  low age expectancy has nothing to do with their style of food philippines 1 problem is endemic corruption at every level of government where nobody can afford proper medical care most products like cooking oils and pharma drugs are totally counterfeit unless you can afford the real ones and air pollution and toxic dumping going unchecked across the country sitting everyday in a jeepney choking on diesel fumes is not going to help your age expectancy either
  lol this much self hate  as a matter of fact bangkok has the worst traffic in asean followed by jakarta statistically speaking and the mrt and lrt arent that bad better once the other lines are built pollution is also comparable to the other sea cities but the presence of old jeepneys might make it slightly worse  and then bangkok is proven to have more expensive real estate most groceries are more expensive and clothes are cheaper in ph so far ive only noticed hotels overall in ph is a little bit more expensive but not by a large margin  general dysfunctional state of everything ect ect  lmao youre a southeas asian dont expect this to work in general  i dont think you can run a proper food cart there without paying a ton of bribes to city officials and running the risk of the toxic carineria owners just firebombing your cart to get rid of you  cringe
  the only problem is corruption nothing else  no statistically most people die to communicable diseases and the majority happen to be in provincial areas if you compare age expectancy with poverty you will see that theres almost a correlation besides ncr actually have one of the higher life expectancies in the country despite the severe pollution  psa gov ph/sites/default/files/hdi20tables2c20final2015jan16_0_0pdf  this probably implies that poor provinces lack accessible medical facilities
  pollution comparable  cringe    a who study released in may 2018 said there were about 453 deaths per 1000000 individuals due to outdoor air pollution china ranked first at 815 deaths recorded while mongolia was second at 488 deaths    manila is 3rd in the world not just sea
  that death rate is still insignificant to the reason why life expectancy is low you brainlet according to this chinas life expectancy should be lower than philippines because almost 16 times more die to air pollution  hanoi has slightly higher pm25 than quezon city where the latter is the most polluted city in philippines its probably due to shitty health care follow up that filipinos die so much to air pollution
  the life expectancy is low because 60 of the philippines consists of multi millions of people stacked on top of each other in shacks and die off from mass cholera and other 3rd world outbreaks of disease that every other country except warzones like yemen have eradicated for the most part
    pic for reference btw
  lol no i already proved that metropolitan areas are not so affected by low life expectancies because of better accessibility to health care     psa gov ph/sites/default/files/attachments/ird/quickstat/ncr_7pdf  psa gov ph/sites/default/files/attachments/ird/quickstat/cebu_12pdf  psa gov ph/sites/default/files/attachments/ird/quickstat/davao20del20sur_9pdf  nap psa gov ph/rucar/pdf/fs/fs_lifeexpectancy_mar12pdf  psa gov ph/sites/default/files/attachments/ird/quickstat/iloilo20jan11pdf  now in most of these places as of 20102015 estimates the life expectancy of men were sometimes under 70 but not by much this is only slightly lower to that of vietnamese men in 2010 which was at 70 overall in 2010 and they are known for their life expectancies
just want to quickly chime in and say that manilla airport is an absolute disorganized shithole  asian layover rankings  snhkklgzmlmn

i wanna rent an airbnb in metro manila what condo unit did you find the best of all
  there were like fucking hundreds not sure youll have a best of all and it will depend on where you want to be right near burgos street nearer to the bay etc plus do you want a balcony or do you prefer a spa in your room they each had different great things about them from my looking so its pretty personal which you think will be the best also then balanced against cost
      i will be in manila for the month of feb  used airbnb  600bucks for a nice place just off burgos first time trying airbnb     i looked for days on the website before i found everything i wanted  goodluck mate     make sure theres good free unlimited wifi in ur unit

is it just me or does some areas look like a huge slum but in reality its actually just a lowclass but not poor residential area where the houses just look shit but are otherwise in great condition
    poor canadafag here    i just save money and dont party too much here  and my city victoria is fucking expensive
  yeah man im in vancouver im starting to work towards a major life change either applying to a masters program so that i could eventually work somewhere likes singapore or bangkok or if i dont get into the program i want to do just saying fuck everything and going to asia to live the sweet sweet tefl life

  job ads are useless in the philippines because anything that pays good is handed out to personal contacts not the general public  go to the bar talk to folks hand em a business card
  same to you remember theres no bad job if it gets you what youre looking for in life      set up a profile post a few photos of yourself list where youre from if youre tall add that to your profile if youre fit post a shirtless photoand youre done if youre a white guy using tinder in the philippines its easier than shooting fish in a barrel with a shotgun
currently in boracay what do
does anyone here know what the average wage is for a 2030 year old filipino    i know their gdp per capita is 3541 but i assume this includes very rich and very poor filipinos so it isnt what the average filipino actually makes a year    i want to know what i should pay for full time staff that will clean my house and cook my meals while i stay for a year or two
  i am not there but i have been hiring philippino vas  first of all i am guessing that in manila and in other popular urban areas you will be paying a 40 premium  and the wage for that particular niche will vary depending on if they have lodging and free food  i am guessing that if you live in the sticks you can pay 200 bucks a month if you give lodgings and food and one day off a week   flips that go to saudi arabia and hong kong make about 500 a month get free stay and food but then the agency probably takes a cut    i pay a basic virtual assistant lowlevel seo and html 400500 bucks a month but then they work at home and prolly have several jobs at once     its not a very cheap country need to go to cambodia to get a maid for 120
  thanks you for replying i need them to speak english so cambodia is not an option    seems like a reasonable salary
  those in provinces can be paid 8 a day or so depending on profession they are in much more need of quality jobs than cityfags
  u fuck whores 30 days a year arent u worried about diseases
hello sir welcome to the philippines
  fruit and veg in the sticks especially avocados im coming from aus are dirt cheap in manila its really not cheap at all for sea  probably another reason why its not a popular destination average wage for manila 2030 is probably around 570usd/m for a call center job
  hello sirs
  thanks i pretty much suspected this      put pics up and talk to them being quite direct is absolutely fine here people are stressed as fuck from the insane work commute and probably want something new ive got my profile advertised that im in an open relationship seems like they couldnt care less im almost 30
what are the average prices in philippines nowadays    meal at jollibee etc in php and other expenses
  jollibee thread when
  i went to jollibees got a hotdog small chips small drink and a chocolate sundae for 130php was bretty gud
    oh no i have to take 1 pill to clear up my drippy dick  besides i dont bareback the street ones 
    i was just reading how nice it is can u explain a bit
  little j would be so disappointed
can you get benzos like valium or xanax over the counter there i really cant drink alcohol without having a benzo in the morning if i dont i feel like having anxiety attacks the rest of the day and will stay indoors  before well then dont drink well i dont drink at home so id rather vacation in places that can work with me on that
is it true rural philippines is very similar to rural thailand would love to give it a visit considering i loved backpacking across rural thailand last year
    tramp
  just because maybe you can does not mean you should i still have some i brought from the us with me but seriously you want to take them and drink in the philippines are you suicidal
  aside from different scripts and buddhist temples instead of churches almost identical both have comfy wood houses in rural areas that look almost the same
i want to plan a trip to camiguin island any advice
  i dont mix them i take the benzos in the morning after a night of hard drinking i know better than to mix the two what is the big deal though if you get fucked up i highly highly doubt that durte would have a white american killed for getting drunk and using legal prescription drugs
  my mom stayed there manilla specifically the hotel she stayed at had no air conditioning and it was one of the nicer hotels in that area only reason why i would visit that place is because my mom is filipino and to maybe see something different
  its not so much the law you have to worry about as it is someone whos going to notice you stumbling around and see an easy target to rob that may or may not include getting stabbed too      even dumpy ass hotels have air conditioning now unless you stay in baguio but you really wouldnt need it there even the malls there are open air
  really nice islands
  camiguin island is a very nice clean safe orderly and historic place to visit famous for their super sweet lanzones going here however is somewhat complicated as their airport is serviced by planes coming only from cebu since we came from manila we flew to cdo 1h50m then chartered a van to bring us to balingoan port 3h then got on a roro boat for the trip to benoni port 1h then chartered a multicab to bring us to our resort  paras beach resort 45m because of the long travel time we rested in our hotel room the rest of the day after checking in the next day we chartered a multicab for a whole day tour of the island multicab charges and other transport are standard  php 1700/8 hours then php 150/hr thereafter since our tour lasted 10 hours i paid our driver/tour guide php 2000 we were fortunate on our visit since it was lanzones season oct to dec and it only costs php 50/kilo there were even some stalls selling for as low as php 35/kilo so we ate lots and lots of lanzones during our tour but unfortunately there is a tradeoff  nov and dec are also wet season in camiguin so we had mostly rain showers during our visit camiguin is a small island that you can visit almost all tourists spots in one day there was one tourist spot however  the mantigue island that we were not able to visit because it had been closed for several months now the reason  no boat operator qualified to the stringent marina requirements the road system in camiguin was simply amazing  all were paved well maintained and clean most tourist spots are for swimming hot springs cold springs waterfalls beaches etc so dont forget your swimming suits and underwater camera and almost all are run by the government so entrance fees and cottages are relatively cheap restaurants and eateries are scattered all over camiguin so not need to bring any packed lunch or snacks
  im a pretty big dude 62 240 pounds i also have never seen a filipino that i was worried about stabbing or robbing me they all seemed pretty chill and fun to hang out with is this a legitimate concern if you are wandering around fucked up
so the legal age of consent is 12 or something silly like that but if i want to play limbo how low can i go before running into trouble
  21    if you want to fuck 18 year old prostitutes go to amsterdam instead if you want to fuck 14 year old girls legally go to germany instead    phillipines is notorious for destroying westerners if you are american you are doubly fucked since your age of consent is 18 globally
  only if youre on the side streets by alleyways etc lets say you were in angeles city if you were staying in a hotel thats directly on fields ave you could wander up and down the walking street and you would probably be fine worst case scenario you wake up with a ladyboy next to you but if your hotel was in friendship or something and you decided to walk to it from fields then youd potentially be in the danger zone if you were going to do that i would recommend tricycles or grab to keep yourself out of harms way
  i addressed this before here     its really not a joke the cops will set you up dont do it
also i want to add youll have no problem fucking 18 year olds but its not always easy to know the difference 18 year olds here look like 15 year olds i dated a 15 year old before that told me she was 18 i seriously thought she looked a bit too young but she gave me some bullshit excuses for why she didnt have an id she could show me i only found out years later when she turned 18 and i got a facebook notification    so with that said my advice for anyone is to find girls that have jobs girls that are in college stay away from the ones on dating sites that have nothing going on in their lives at all theyre usually pretty trash anyway i know from experience
anyone from la about a decade ago i had the best meal of my life chicken burrito from a roach coach im considering taking a generator and 2 deep freezers half way accross the country and stocking up but i want to know if its even there still    it was next to a pilot and i think a bar there were bottle lids all over the okace and another truck stop acceoss the street    is it there
  yeah its still there you should load up man
  next to a pilot  cdl holder detected
ive got 3k aud to travel around europe only need to be in london for two nights but can pretty much do whatever the fuck else i want     wondering if 3k will cover it
depends on how long and how many hookers you want to fuck
  2 weeks  maybe one hooker
    are you travelling from australia half that will be spent on flights if you stay in hostels id budget 80 euros a day or 150au dont drink at bars and youll be sweet for two weeks
    to have a good time you will need about 100 euro a day for basic accommodation and food maybe around 50 if you stay in hostels in 10 bed dorms this is not including any sort of transport costs    north/west is the most expensive go south/east and things get cheaper
    eastern europe man that budget will make you live like a king anywhere in poland ukraine slovakia and so on
im too poor to travel how the fuck do you guys afford it
  with a job  spoilerd/spoiler
  i have a job but make just shy of 30k per year before tax saving is so hard and you guys travel so much
cheap flights either by misprice or deals or last minute seats    cheap accommodation staying in hostels with friends last minute hotels can have significant discounts depending on how many rooms the hotel has to shift    use public transportation only no hire cars no uber or taxis just bus metro tram  exceptions being if the country has extremely cheap fuel costs maybe hire a car    use a specialist card that offers perfect no fee exchange rates    stick to a strict budget    thats what i try to do to make it more affordable
  how do i find mispriced flights
  just have patience anon not everyone has the same opportunities    also remember that many times is all appearances be sure your time will come
overborrow on student loans   work a string of lowpaying jobs for incomebased 0 per month payments   do a masters degree  justify the few thousand extra for traveling with well my masters costs 50000 so an extra 5000 isnt going to make much difference  apply for phd programs   well i already get a stipend so its okay to take a loan for a roundtrip fare right
  you can check websites that list error fares like this page    wwwholidaypiratescom/tag/error theres other sites as well if you have a look    you can set up price alerts for routes you are interested in and hope something comes up
  move up    i worked minimum wage until 28 years old then i bit the bullet saved up an entire year and switched to part time minimum wage work while going back to university with loans    it was harsh but its possible if you really want it in fact after the initial period of getting used to school again it felt more laidback than working a shitty minimum wage job since you feel like you are actually making something of yourself for once    i believe in you anon
  30k isnt minimum wage retard its above the median uk wage
  but that is only 39k usd 60k usd is the median wage in the us    are you saying british people make only half of the average american i refuse to believe that maybe after taxes its 30k pound median in the uk i always saw the uk as a first world country so why are wages so low
  op here and yes our economy is so shit you americans have it really good cucks over here in the uk always pull out muh nhs and muh holidays as if it justifies literally earning half the salary of a us citizen which is ridiculous and yet uk people constantly jerk off over how dumb they think americans are
  30k is a pretty good salary in the uk except if youre in london but youre right wages here are shit and still the same as they were pre2008 levels as above says people think our economy is way better than it actually is yet productivity is so low compared to other big economies and stuff like employment rates are really deceptive as even working 1 hour every 2 weeks counts as being employed still 30k a year is more than enough to travel on if youre not a retard when it comes to saving
  39k is half of 60k  and here you are trying to fathom economics        cucks  you are about 20th on the planet in disposable income ppp and that is without any discernible quality products or talent also having 14 more holidays than us cucks is a literal 34   reduction of gnp nhs affects your spendable income in a positive way and youve lost 15 of your exchange rate since brexit since you decided to turn your back on the one thing you had going for you     tldr its a complicated issue and if you are trying to wrap your head around it by talking about it on this here indonesian trainspotting forum you are doing it wrong
get a job working for an international hotel chain like hyatt thats what i did for a long time they pay is okay but they offered paid vacation time and comps/discounts at any hyatt in the world
  set up a daily food budget  a checkly disposable income budget and the amount you are supposed to save per check  its not too hard once you get into the rythm
i make about 27k usd and i still go travelling at least a couple times a year the big thing is simplify your home expenses i own my car which means my insurance is lower instead of having a cell plan home internet a land line cable etc i just got a cell plan with unlimited data a phone that can hotspot and a chromecast i dont use my credit card all that much dont eat out all that often
  be aware that the us dollar is currently very strong and the pound very weak a decade or so ago 30k would have been equivalent to 60k
  live at home lmao
  do you live in london otherwise 30k is more than enough to save for travelling
  first bear in mind that travel does not have to involve crossing oceans travel is gong someplace other than where you normally live your life you can do that with a cab in many big cities if you approach it right for almost everybody who might be visiting /trv/ there is some place within a days cartrip of you that people fly across oceans to visit  lucky you you live nearby
  look for your next job to be something where travel is part of the job works for me  loyalty miles i get from my work travel makes travel for my own purposes a lot cheaper
  working for airlines or an airport is also a nice dodge    last time i was about to board a plane struck up a conversation with a guy who worked as a baggage handler at clt he was about to head off to someplace in the caribbean with his wife based on travel perks that came with his job
i collect tin cans on the side of the road to sell
get a roth ira and start investing in stocks i am a day trader i make a good amount of money doing it and can work any where in the world it just needs to have internet heres a quick tip buy armn nio or acb
  pretty fucking easily op because i  dont eat out every day often will cook my own meal at home saving tons  if i go out to drink i have a good bit at home then just keep my buzz going at the bar  dont own a car that is anything more than point ab  dont buy huge brand name electronic device curren_year model each year  book well in advance to cheaper locations during off seasons make use of hostels  put x/ per week into travel/slush fund    been about 6 months since my last trip overseas have about 2500 usd to spend for my christmas through new years this year obviously not going to spend it all but is nice to have
  go deep into armn while you still can that bad boy is going to skyrocket onces it gets approve by the fda all that way up to 65 still at a bargain at 17
  i made 23k/year and worked at that job for just over a year i could save enough to go travel for about five months obviously if you live in london its different but i was working in nottingham at the time
  when i lived at home with my parents and went to community college i could still work get good grades and travel i made about 8000/year    im transferring to a four year university next semester and it costs about 4x as much it was nice hanging with you guys on /trv/ but i guess ill head over to /tv/ now if i were healthier i would have joined the army
    fuck off
tefl/esl has worked out pretty well for me    ive met plenty of people who just bullshit their way into work but if you spend some months saving and getting your teaching certificate before flying out you can easily save over 1000 a month on 100 hours a month in certain countries doing a doss job before spending the rest of the year travelling wherever you will    it also helps if you have a degree
  im british and i go travelling all the time     its not difficult to save money most people just have no discipline    if i really wanted to i could rent a room for 200 a month in a shared house given i earn 2000 a month id be fucking loaded by the end of the year to fuck off to anywhere i wanted
  brit here you read that all right income and purchasing power in general is much lower here
  what got you so mad op ask how we can afford to travel i answer it and gave him a tip
start your own company one thats actually cool and can solve a global problem then you can frequently go on business trips that you dont have to pay for the travel wont be all fun and games but you can still schedule things in    at least thats what im doing in the past two years ive been around canada usa south korea japan malaysia singapore and might be doing some stuff in the middle east and europe this upcoming year
  if you live near an airport you could get a parttime job working for an airline handling baggage or helping passengers in the terminal and lounges     one of my friends does that once a week for air france all he does is work in the terminal and help passengers find the gates he gets travel benefits such as heavily discounted flights and hotels he flew transatlantic between paris and washington dc round trip for less than 150
  i made payments all year to some package deal and now i am going ona boat

  pretty hard in the current us economy unless you have some kind of degree in technology mechanics math based field or some shit getting a job is really hard i cant find anywhere that even wants my bachelors of management and its even from a good school it just sucks all around
  probably you arent seriously looking for a job  usa is really large  apply in every state
  its not one state its all of them the current leadership is just making it tough on anyone not ultra rich coming out of college at the worst possible time especially in california where we just got destroyed by fire from some trump border patrol agent retard blowing something up for a gender celebration party
  work full time while still living at my moms place
i do affiliate marketing and i earn around1500 usd/month which is pretty decent money if you travel around cheap countries i was getting massages in thailand every single day oil massage thai massage foot massage
  most people just dont know how to deal with money  makes 2000 after tax  lives at home  friend you dont know how to deal with money any better than other people you have literally the best conditions in the world no one complaining about being too poor to travel makes your amount of money
  its not one state its all of them  no its not unemployment is at a low of 3 we havent havent had such a strong labor market in decades suck it up buttercup
    really dude if you make at least 2000usd in a month or so you can afford to travel at least once a year    i was able to save by buying bulk food eating/drinking cheap ie at home and playing ftp games like mechwarrior online tf2 or buying vidya during sales on steam if i went out i ordered 1 drink and no more and always ate/drank before going out so i wouldnt spend an asston of money i use the library for good books my only luxury purchases each month is a gym membership cell phone and the occasional visit to the skating rink surprisingly great place to meet qts    you can save if you learn to let go of instant gratification it feels like monkmode at first then you realize how much money you waste on bullshit and become quite happy seeing zeroes in your bank account     let go of creature comforts now so you can go out and experience the world later     start with small travel destinations that are closeby and work your way out farther and farther as you save it also helps to buy your ticket months ahead of time 6 so that you have something to save for extra motivation goes a long way and its wayyy cheaper to travel if you buy in advance     learn to be selfish with your money and time if people are holding you back due to obligation or some other bullshit tell them to fuck off when it comes to your money     you only get one life on this planet get out there and see as much of it as you can
    you think i have the best conditions in the world but i studied for 5 years and i make less than the average wage in my state    with 2000 euros i will not be able to have a family or property while also enjoying a middle class lifestyle    for living alone sure i have it pretty good
  sounds like my lifestyle i make 70k a year but i hardly spend money because im happy with a fairly spartan lifestyle my wife is a bit more spendy but i manage to keep her reigned in for the most part
i have sacrificed a lot to be able to travel im now 32 but throughout my 20s i mostly lived with my parents they have a huge house and im their only child sure it wasnt cool living with them and i didnt get the chance to live close to the city center but it let me save tons on rent i also never owned a car here in my home city i have owned a couple of cars abroad now which i bought and sold to travel in i make 30/h cdn 35h per week so i make around 50k a year and i was able to save around 30k a year through most of my 20s    i know not everyone is able to live without paying rent but there were other things i was saving on like not eating out as much as my friends/coworkers having hobbies that are free or cheap after an initial investment not spending money at the most cool new club instead going for drinks with friends to our local bar where the prices are like 1/5th    i will give you another suggestion that many people might not agree with here dont go on week long vacations they are actually not cheaper than traveling long term if you do 3 trips a year like that you pay way more than going somewhere for a few months my suggestion is to save up for a few years and then go backpacking in a cheap part of the world for a long time travel in india for 6 months will set you back the same as giong to hawaii for 2 weeks    another thing i can suggest is start reading travel blogs of travelers from places like poland or other eastern european countries a lot of them are people in their 20s who obviously dont earn much in their countries but have some great strategies for cheap travel things like couchsurfing hitchhiking going abroad on work holiday visas even some going as far as doing doing street shows to earn an extra income you have to be fearless to do some of these things but when theres a will theres a way
    60k is the median wage     no its not thats the gdp per capita the median wage as stated by the social security administration is between 25000 and 30000 per year    youre fucking delusional if you think most americans are making that much
  this especially if you live in europe an interesting destination that you have not been too is most likely not more than a couple of hours with the car/bus/train away   for my last trip i went to a neighbouring country for a week and it was so cheap that i still saved money that month just less than usual  ofc it helps to live frugal at home and abroad as other anons have already mentioned
  no not this you really cant be considered a traveler unless you cross a channel ocean or sea     its just not the same if its all connected by land its practically sharing all the same culture take the uk for example
  the median household income in the united states rose from 61858 in may 2018 to 62175 in june 2018
work abroad
  household  yes thats usually 2 wages
  unless you cross a channel  a bong traveling to continental europe isnt anymore traveling than an american driving from texas to florida
  different country different culture different people completely different america so so same it hurts funny you mention florida went to get some sun in miami just rained a lot and the people were just like the ones in ny no fun and all boring there was just more mexican food
    you yanks actually believe this every time you say this you sound salty that europeans can do this and you cant    also no im not from europe
  how to start your own company what do you even do to create a company do you just get and idea and try to sell it or some shit should i just take a business class
  try live in new zealand
  stop complaining and just work hard
  what the fuck do you do and where   there are probably only a couple of countries in the world where a below average salary gets you 2k clean and being below average in those countries is still probably 10x better than being above average somewhere else
  and the people were just like the ones in ny  because south florida is a new york colony
  i made 22k a year and went on holiday twice to china 10 days each time and spent 23k each time    stay at home
  ive been working for 8 months in the province of lai chau during that time ive paid off 2000 debt had a 10 trip to japan and saved 3000    im going back to hanoi in january to work until the summer so i can go on to do some proper travelling
    i make 18k a year and can still afford to travel somewhere once or twice a year
im studying foreign languages as a hobby and basically sweettalking my internet penpals into letting my stay at their place for free
government jobs are the best i make 60k a year with no degree and get personal days vacation time and sick time if i stay for 20 years ill get retirement and a check every month plus whatever my sick time payout comes out too
  live cheap and save
  idk op didnt travel for like 10 yrs fucking kill me i cant afford it
  thats 3 times more i earn fuck off retard
  if im a retard how come i outearn you
  3 times the money  cant afford it    take a wild guess as for the strawmen question because i live in eastern shithole
  come to the uk we accept literally anyone
  he ended up in some nepotistic company its obvious this is really common in europe
mileage programs book in the winter or spring or ahead of time live cheaply and look for a job with pto
get a job making average pay and have no friends/gfs    your savings will just grow and grow
  household income is the same as wage    holy shit here i was ready to kill myself because no matter how hard i work ill always be poorer that the average yank thank fuck
  if you remove retired and unemployed people from the median wage the median wage in the us is still 60k usd so dont worry you can still go ahead and kill yourself
i live in the philippines and earn around 6000 usd annually thats 34 times minimum wage where i live the main reason i can save is because i still live with my parents and they are reasonably well off so i dont have to pay any bills i can afford to go on out of the country trips two to three times a year with one of them being trips with the parents and they take care of expenses    i only travel to nearby countries because the flights are so cheap japan round trips can cost 350 usd normally and even significantly lesser during promos hell i have a south korea trip with my family in february and it cost us less than 40usd per person to fly there and back it was a seat sale    its even better if i fly to other sea countries vietnam is extremely affordable to travel in much cheaper than the ph while thailand and malaysia are around the same level when it comes to costs    i can only go on short trips though usually 1 week because i cant stay away from the office too long and it would also cost a lot to go on extended trips
  you americans have it really good  yeah until you get sick or break something im fine with my eu healthcare thanks
  underage b
  you can still have healthcare insurance thats private you know sure it costs more than in europe about 300800 a month based on your health but even if you subtract that from your salary you would still make more in the us
ive been to colombia and costa rica where else must i go in sa    im intrigued by mexico and chile/patagonia    id like to see more amazon but never thought much of brazil    i like to hike camp and eat like most of us    and i like to do things on the cheap
going to colombia in a week and a bit so excited for that but as for where else you should go id recommend ecuador peru and bolivia for doing things on the cheap chile/patagonia is amazing but more expensive however i know people whove camped/hitchhiked/taken other measures to reduce the costs     apparently now is also a good time to go to argentina because their economy has crashed but dont quote me on that
hi im a canadian applying for the tier 5 mobility scheme in the uk and was wondering if any brits could help me out    i dont have a job lined up yet and this is my biggest concern im a 2 year carpenter with no schooling for it but do have a university education in another field but id prefer to continue carpentry    how hard is it to find a job in london amd what should i expect to earn and is there any requirements or courses i need to work on construction sites
  i cant help you on the specifics but i know we have a record shortage of skilled construction workers here and london is piss easy to find a job in the problem is new construction will almost completely dry up if we have a no deal brexit
leaving canada  for the uk    wew
wow
dont think london needs carpenters mate honestly a dying trade afaik do you mean house building or cabinets either way its a dying trade
  well you have no idea why youre talking about there is thousands of postings looking for all kinds of carpenters and the last year when i was in london i saw tons of new construction and old renovations     just dont post if you dont have info its so easy      its for a girl and im not moving there permanently       do you know if i can apply for the visa even if i dont have a job lined up
  you would be competing with romanians and other eastern europeans so expect a 8 p/hr pay check
  oh boy its yet another im sure the grass is greener there anon  protip  1 finding work within your own country is almost always infinitely easier unless you actually live in some shithole like venezuela  2 without a degree youre going to be fighting against any other migrate of any kind for lowest possible wages for work not a high paying job generally at home in your native country even without a degree you can land something higher than a migrant  4 if you never have no skillset marketable getting a working visa is generally harder or next to impossible minus some exclusions such as country work partnerships some eu rules or so on  5 just because you see higher pay in x location doesnt mean that you can bank all that generally cities have higher pay that seems great because cost of living in or within reason around the city is that much impactful on pay   6 if you havent spent a decent amount of time in said country dont assume its better try looking around in your own country for wherever and whatever your skillset seems more useful  7 if you a dont have a job lined up and/or b have a decent amount of saving built up thinking moving to another country and adjusting into it will just set you in debt and setting you up for probable failure    sure there are exceptions to when people have up and moved and made an awesome life for themselves but there are far more failures you never hear about    also  its for a girl and im not moving there permanently   please be trolling
  you would pursue a trade in bongland as a migrant rather than canada as a citizen are you crazy lol
  you must be a miserable cunt who fucked up on his dreams in life and now shits on other peoples    ive lived and worked in japan aus canada and america maybe someone like you cant survive in the real world if smelly indian migrants can make it then anyone can make it you have no actual knowledge about this subject and youre just a sad angry goof good luck in life staying in your small town forever bud    and yea it is for a girl who ive already been with for several months sorry the magic is gone in your life
  just for a year or 2 yes i like having different experiences
  also i just noticed you said protip you are not a pro full of knowledge you are a loser full of anger and regret
  sure there are exceptions to when people have up and moved and made an awesome life for themselves but there are far more failures you never hear about    actually i am one of those people who got up and moved from one end of the us to the other on a whim and started working it paid off well but i am skilled in a needed field though i know many many failure stories about people who attempted something similar or into another country and completely ended up with debt into their eyeballs and very depressed    you missed the part where i said there are exceptions you are indeed one of them good on ya however there are so many failures out there
  well those people are going to fail even if you wave your warning at them just felt like such unnecessary negativity all i wanted was some advice or info from brits or people working in britian not life advice on how naive you think i am
is brussels a safe place to visit for 2 weeks for a lonely brit do they like brits
  safe  just stop it of course its fucking safe    lonely brit  at least you got the lonely part right
  aside from the architecture in the main square brussels is pretty shit stay a couple of nights in ghent and brugges nearby compact charming medieval towns
  no its a war zone you will die    try somewhere like mogadishu or port au prince
  this guy gets it    so yeah its safe dont walk around drunk and alone at night and youll be fine two weeks is way too long though
  dont wear laptop bag if you dont want to be robbed
  exaggerations make baby jesus cry
it really didnt feel safe  like youre constantly in a ghetto or something i kept hearing stories of peoples bag being snatched on garu du nord from pretty much everyone
just stay away from the southern half wallonia and youll be fine
  hows namur belgianfags is there any rivalry against francophones
    havent been there in two decades so i cant really comment on that but id be surprised if the francophone locals would flip you off for speaking slightly different french
turning 31 in july i have not much time to apply for a working holiday visa so i would like to know if i dont get it on time what are the chances for me as a software dev to get a regular working visa skillselect     and how hard is it to get a job as a software developer coming from abroad
coming from germany going to australia    i forgot here are no flags
  if youre good at it not that hard
  i worked with very relevant technologies in the last 2 years so i am more worried about getting the permit than the job considering i have only a bachelors degree i assume its only possible with a working holiday visa
gonna go to a car campground and stay there for a week with my dog      first time in my life im doing this what are some things i should know     its the pharaoh campground at the shawnee national park probably gonna go there day after tomorrow    i dont own a tent and my car is tiny whats a good way to sleep comfortably and for cheap my doggo could probably sleep in the car but i really dont wanna spend a couple hundred for a tent    ideas
  go to target/walmart and buy a tent for 25 if it looks like rain buy a tarp to throw over it for extra weather protection  youre fucking car camping man not through hiking the appalachian trail
  it might rain see pic related    ok i will buy a tent for 25 from walmart thanks i didnt know they could be that cheap i will also buy tarp    what about food should i take loaves of bread with me and eat peanut butter or order pizza there its a campsite so there is also a fireplace i would assume but i dont know how to light a fire but im still gonna burn firewood by using youtube videos to learn how to
  good luck finding a pizza place that delivers that far out
  so how will i survive then
  you wont
  make sure you stick a pine cone up your poop chute to prevent wild hobos from butt raping you
  lmao fr tho i think im gonna take loaves of bread and peanut butter and jam and chips and chocolate water is available at the campsite so i do not have to worry about that
  take a can of chunky soup with you ask someone if they mind if you put it in their embers stir twice once each time it bubbles make friends and eat soup at the same time  t work a real job in australia so need to cook food like this a lot
  going car camping  not even bringing hot dogs to cook over the fire  youre very bad at this
  i said its my first time i will have to buy firewood though and burn a fire but that seems like a difficult task well see how it goes i also dont know how to cook hot dogs so ill have to learn that lol      i dont wanna make friends i want to spend the time by myself as a sort of therapeutic getaway which i really really need from my stressfull life    but noodles are a good idea i just need to learn how to create fire
bump leaving tomorrow
  bring paper and lighter fluid collect small twigs and build a teepee shape put paper inside build teepee with medium sticks spray with lighter fluid everywhere and light paper add big sticks when hot enough its mostly practice youll be right
   i also dont know how to cook hot dogs   i just need to learn how to create fire    how on earth do you not know how to do these things maybe dont take your dog
  not an outside camping expert
  maybe dont take your dog    the dog may save his life
    find out if you can cook with a fireplace or if youd need a gas stove cheapest way in the woods same as at home is to cook food yourself a cooler is essential too if you cant cook and have to rely on sandwiches you gotta keep that shit cold and yes you can get a tent for under 40 pretty easily youll also of course want a cheap foam sleep mat and some blankets/pillow or sleeping bag       also buy a few giant jugs of drinking water youll always need it and shits dirt cheap
      hes never done it before understandable but dont you want to learn just get a fire going keep it contained put a hotdog over it til its hot and dripping and split but not burnt work your way up if you fuck up a few hotdogs thats fine learn these basics
  this triggers both my /out/ism and sc/out/ism this triggers me     if its going to rain you need a ground tarp and a tent tarp tuck your ground tarp underneath the foot print of the tent repeat do not have the ground tarp wider than the footprint of your tent    if food is a concern and its just one or two nights you dont need hot food just make a bunch of sandwiches and grab a few bananas maybe some chips and other fruit please dont forget stuff to keep your dog fed and entertained       to build a fire collect dryer lint or rub cotton balls with vasoline to make little fire starters collect sticks smaller than that your pinky then the width of your thumb then width of of your wrist to build a fire let it breath give it time have patience go ask out for the fire infographic since i dont have it     bring 2 gallons of water     please consult the check in my pic related
hi /trv/ im going to northern lapland next week i know its very specific but do you know where can i eat some good reindeer meat     i will be around inari finland and bugoynes norway
it should be fine anywhere i could only give you recommendations in rovaniemi
  go there in december not before because the christmas season begin only the 01 dec but its just a tourists market nothing to do there    but for the meat normally everywhere i never heard about a specific place in finland
reindeer meat is not good
  fuck off reindeer meat is delicous
  its incredibly easy to get
  hows the winter sports culture up there for a simple layman that enjoys skiing once in a while i know the country its on the expensive side but maybe its worth it to go that north to really experience the winter
ive been to adelaide melbourne cairns port douglas and sydney i am currently stuck in sydney until the 6th of december and would like to see something different perhaps tasmania or a place in south australia or northern territory but mostly tasmania i also need to work so tips and locations to go fruit picking or do construction work for a good wage like at a solar farm for example are welcome   i plan on doing something like cherry picking for a month or two in tasmania but i am open for different jobs and locations it just has to count towards my second year visa   postcodes  
okay just tell me which city to go to in tasmania to find a good paying fruit picking or other farm job
  sydney  enjoying the hordes of chinese    also implying a company will just give you a fucking nobody with no australian qualifications a job you need at least a cert 3 in agricultural industry operations to do shit like fruit picking go do that and come back in 3 years
  fruit picking  
    
  you need a certification to pick fruit   hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahanahahahahahahahaha
  certification for fruit picking
tassie doesnt really have cities launceston and hobart are really just towns by global standards    youre going to want a car in tassie    for reference its about the size of ireland and has 500k people in it total of which 300k live in hobart and launceston
  this site skirts law and the business will probably file your work under expenses instead of labour because its illegal         not a meme dont expect to get even an internship here without a few years experience in fairness cert 3 ag ops covers a lot of farmhand tasks
  the government literally put fruit picking on the list of jobs that make you eligible for a second year visa with tips for backpackers on how to approach this job you are the only person dumb enough to believe that you need a certificate that takes 3 years to go fruit picking
allright so if anyone knows a good toen to find work or good working hostels anywhere in australia as long as its in an area with a postcode that is eligible for a second year please tell me
is he the greatest travel vlogger of all time
  hes not bad i like the lack of flashy effects editing and loud generic music all the time
    hes pretty good hes actually better than harald baldr who is still good     i just wish hed give india a rest and go somewhere else even russia was more interesting india is getting boring now but i guess hes got a massive fan base there
  probably a bit low on cash at the moment expanding and milking the indian fan base could be a smart move  seems like hes going to do europe next year he just started the vlogging after all
    yeah not go full /pol/ but those pajeets will support anyone who makes their country look like anything thats not a massive shit hole literally
nojokehoward owns that title
  tranny chaser  junkie  kicks dogs in the face  chad  pretty based
  meant for 
  not sure if greatest but sure is a laugh having to backtrack back to buttfuck in as a sober druggie and still having a longing for that ladyboy cock yeah i said it it was a hilarious journey indeed the dude is not bashful on video i actually met the guy on the street in pp seemed a bit shy then
gabriel traveler is bestbriel traveler  i like him because he does not show any personality in his videos i dont care about him i just want to see prices of shit and where the hostels are  he just gives facts with no attempt to entertain
  no shit you did ive heard people say he was shy in person before damnest thing yeah he gives me a good laugh hes so deep in the closet it fucking kills me laughing when hes unironically explaining that sucking a ladyboy off isnt gay much based       sounds a lot like me except just the top two
  no shit you did  yeah i was sitting at a cafe in pp with some dude that was an acquaintance of his the dude called him over and me being casual and greeting him sort of put him on the edge he was a mix of a laughing stock / tolerated by the cambodian expat forums so i guess he tended to be on edge around other expats in pp i never saw him as anything else but a peculiar and original dude you gotta respect the dude for not being a regular bitter drunk expat that has nothing but hate for the host nation at the end of the day when the pills wore off it was obvious that he just like me loves the khmer people he does not piss on them for being poor and uneducated and that counts for something
hello here is a picture of a pretty girl here is a sentence that is vaguely related to travel here is another sentence that creates an extremely tenuous link between my picture and the sentence about travel    now talk
where do i find pretty girls with low standards that will love me    can you teach me to flirt    how much is it    what is love
  ive had sex i scored everyone praise me because i put my wiener in a girl
  you did the sex for real or are you just larping
im a college student and i want to travel to korea this summer but i cant tell if its because of my genuine interest in the culture and getting outside of my comfort zone or subconscious yellow fever help
  that girl is very pretty i like girls like those  the picture is making me feel sad and lonely because ive never had a gf only ugly/obese women consider me attractive but my standards are too high to just settle for them  i will continue playing video games to forget about my solitude
does anyone know where ops picture was taken the background looks comfy
  hes larping everyone is a loser like me
  girl face eyes hair pretty
now i will trash talk a region of the world for being worse than mine even though it is only tangentially related to a place mentioned in a previous comment that is not the topic of the thread
long monologue about how my short stay in a city gives me a thorough understanding of the respective countrys history and culture
has anyone ever fallen in love when traveling i had a girl touch my pee pee once and invited me over to stay a 2 days i am a shut in at home but i plan to go back in a few months and ask her to marry me i think its going to work out fine
are the hookers in budapest better looking than the hookers in amsterdam
i like guys and i an immune to the effects of ops picture i am special
i just arrived at my destination with no preconception of what i wanted to do please tell me what i should do
i dont know why all the racists hate on indians in my travels i havent met kinder people they are always happy to help you they are educated intelligent humble ambitious but not arrogant they are the best people i am the furthest away from an indian but i can always count on them to be my brothers from another mother if i find myself lonely they also understand best what is means to be a foreigner in another country not always welcome not always loved   just wanted to say this
  no worse
guys i just arrived at the airport and super scared of flying i booked a trip to random place for 2 weeks and havent done any research at all help urgent    btw will never check again on the thread i created fyi
  sigh why must home be so boring i just left home for the first time in my country to go visit other_country for 2 weeks it was magical the best time i ever had now i am back home and depressed why must my country be so unlike other country well the only thing to do now is post on 4chan non stop about it and woe about my life
this thread is autism
  home sweet home
cheapest travel destinations /trv/go    destinations good for beginner travelers preferred
lurkmoar    best way to get there is with the catalog or the questions that dont deserve their own thread or the stupid questions general
  it really depends on where you are and if you have relatives/friends you can stay by  for instance i can travel to philadelphia on a budget of less than 150 for a week including getting there and back because its easy to get there on the cheap since im in nyc and i have relatives
  oh cmon matedont be harshhes an idiot who forgot to tell us where hes from though    tickets vary a lotjust tell us your country first
for me probably the outer banks of north carolina its about 3 hours away so it takes about 20 bucks in gas to get there but my mom lives there so i dont have to pay for lodging or food when i get there also i can do laundry there instead of paying a dollar for each load it might be different for you though if your mom doesnt live on the outer banks or you live further away who knows though
this is a schroedingers cat question for me because travel habits change depending on where you go i spend more in southeast asia than i do in europe because in europe i hitchhike and stealth camp and eat sardines while in sea i stay in nice hotels and eat at restaurants 3 meals a day
  for long term travels its asia either south asia or south east asia    for short term travels it will vary depending on where youre from
  same
if you can walk to it its the cheapest
alright /trv/ lets settle it once and for all    what are the major differences and/or similarities between these two countries    im talking more cultural not in terms of geography cause you cant argue that theres a greater variety of interesting places to visit in japan    food  social life  work culture  girls/guys  old people  language    whatever it is share your experiences
  this thread can only end shitty  food  korean food is generally spicier many things can be fried a good amount of similar dishes though  social life  about the same in the major cities koreans do flaunt their purchases far more and tend to be a bit more vocal in public  work culture  each one is seeing how to kill its employees faster  girls/guys  depends both huge countries depends who you look for and where you go both have their cool people and shit people sluts and good citizens kpop fans or weebs etc etc  old people  both have em and old people suck  language  unless youre moving to either one or doing a very long stay there isnt much to learn outside basic phrases at each and stick to english     they are two different countries just both asian this thread will end up the same shit way like they always do  k fag posts about how weebs are smelly and ruin everything  j fag will post about how korea is full of plastic face women and asshole men  k fag will post how nothing to do in tokyo and how shit the rail system is compared to seoul   j fag will talk about how nothing to do outside of seoul   k fag posts about how weebs are smelly and ruin everything
  i imagined that while making this    i was mainly curious to hear experiences from people whove lived/traveled extensively in both countries    ive visited both and liked many aspects and found certain cultural differences intriguing besides the meme responses that youve listed    for example i found elderly japanese people were far likelier to appreciate my attempts at speaking their language versus koreans
  oh and also hitchhiking was far easier in korea in terms of frequency of rides caught but the people who picked me up in japan were much likelier to offer me a meal or a place to stay at their house
koreans love japanese food japanese love korean food who am i to compare the two  i like more complex seasonings and dont care if you caught that fish two hours ago or a day ago so im persoonally with korea not to say that korean food isnt generally more fresh than most of the world  i dont even understand when people begin to compare social life in japan versus anything else there is such a clear glass wall between you and japanese people that is simply not there with koreans fake is everywhere always but i dont like japanese nervous fake  work culture sucks in both  i like that in japan there is a bit more variety of guys so much easier to find someone who doesnt have the same haircut as the resident most famous actor  old people are universally nice to me everywhere though they were indeed nicer in japan or at least they werent pushing at all there  i see even less point in comparing the languages than comparing anything else
  korean food is better for me because i like spicy food    japan has better customer service and is cleaner    japan
korean girls are prettier taller bitchier more materialistic dress nicer    korean guys are more handsome taller more confrontational more fashionable heavier drinkers douchier    koreans as a whole are 100x more shallow lookist and selfconscious than their japanese counterparts    foreign girls in korea say they get constantly approached by korean guys and that korean guys are quite straight forward and aggressive in clubs and such while foreign girls in japan say theyve almost never been approached by a japanese guy
  the japanese were surprisingly nice despite at the time being a us marine loved the food in japan more than the korean food though thats highly subjective nightlife in seoul was a lot better than it was in tokyo the other posters were right about koreans being materialistic appearance is everything over there this includes wealth status university graduated from etc the korean written language for the most part is 30x less convoluted that the japanese one its actually very well thought out
  koreans are more racist but they are better looking than japanese people
  not to say that korean food isnt generally more fresh than most of the world  it historically wasnt hence their heavy use of spices and the cuisine puts more emphasis on pickling than freshness its similar to some indian cuisines where flavor complexity dominates
  dominates over simple or plain flavors
  yes historically for sure these days its still not on par with japan but its well above world average
japan is so much more interesting its not even a competition korea is a once and done place its a soulless copy of ugly americanstyle infrastructure developments with onedimensional gimmick food three days in seoul is more than enough you could spend a month in tokyo and not be bored once
japanese people flush their used toilet paper koreans put their used toilet paper in a trash can
  this

  put their used toilet paper in a trash can  fucking disgusting
    i was quite disappointed with japanese food as everybody always hypes it up so much theres too much bland and/or fried stuff and it gets boring very quickly korean food has a lot of variety of flavors but do get someone local to show you the more interesting dishes as it might not be easy to find good ones yourself   life  korea generally has a livelier social life and people are more fun to spend time with but i was not disappointed with japan at all and the japanese people i met were fantastic although this is certainly a biased selfselected sample as all of these people were happy to talk to a foreigner in the first place   culture  dunno but people complain about the same things in both countries    in korea everyone dresses the same which is annoying as fuck whenever you ask one of them about it theyre just like haha yeah koreans are so fucking stupid girls are generally more attractive in japan but the pretty ones in korea can be absolutely stunning   people  pushy and loud in korea polite in japan in both places they treat foreigners extra nicely though    its possible to learn to read korean in a couple of hours which is a huge plus since even buying a fucking snack in japan can be exasperating due to not being able to guess what the fuck it is that youre buying or how to explain what you want to a store clerk koreans also speak better english and are less shy to use english with you    overall i found both countries to be worth visiting the lifestyle in both is quite similar but the people are rather different     one important point that you didnt ask about is the nature and historical sites if youre interested in them at all then japan is a fucking paradise on earth while korea doesnt really have anything to offer outside of city life unless you enjoy hiking around boring repetitive mountains surrounded by old people    i would personally recommend korea a bit more overall
  do k girls like western guys
  i made a thread a while ago but ill take the opportunity since you seem to know what youre talking about im planning to go to korea next year what are the best places to see outside seoul i intend to go there for like 2 weeks or so and rent a car to see most of the coast maybe incheon to like ulsan is this something feasable or should i just pick a few places and use public transports between them i only selected 3 or 4 places of interest so far so im taking suggestions
  everyone go home fpbp even the strawman arguments are accurate on both sides
each have their own benefits and such but if someone asked me right out of the blue which should i go to id probably state japan for the following reason  stupid easy tourism promotion for many many cities in japan via websites train station info dumps shit just promoted on google  near idiot proof train system  actual notable things outside tokyo  would be a lot harder to find anyone who would come off as seeming rude to you for not knowing something  yen to usd/euro is way easier to understand for someone than the won system  more preserved historical things than post 1910 things  no china dust/smog storms  google maps and other things far easier to work with in japan over crazy korea law stuff    if i had to say to anyone list 5 notable towns/cities outside the capital of each without a map fairly certain japan would get more easily named to do things      that said if you really want to know the difference visit both youll probably see a lot of similarities between both and i doubt if youre just doing main cities be able to spot most differences in the social aspect i know someone will post about well some old shrines older cities and temples exist which i would say that if youve been to japan or korea they will all blend together extremely fast unless you really are invested in knowing the differences behind them
  girls like guys in general k girls are no different      i honestly enjoyed seoul and busan the most korean countryside is a bit boring compared to japan and cities like incheon are just miniature seoul with fewer things to do and more commieblocks you could try jeonju i guess its a bit different than others
  jeonju was on the list as a definite thing maybe ill alocate some more time to seoul and busan and rush through the countryside more thanks
   to usd/euro is way easier to understand for someone than the won system  converting money is hard
  yen to usd/euro is way easier to understand for someone than the won system  lmao 10 won is literally equal to 1 yen
  if were talking cities outside seoul and busan tbh i preferred eg gwangju daelim  acc hood over jeonju for the vibe gwangju with its plethora of popup places was like a rural hongdae outpost with some historical stuff and easy mountain access templestays etc  jeonju old town is cool but if you want to do anything else not much going on
  to play devils avocado  korea has far less tourists and more undiscovered gems great for muh real traveler
    why the fuck are you in every thread asking this question youre the one that was sending out those pms on reddit arent you
    i said if i was asked out of the blue meaning presumably someone who doesnt travel abroad but wanted to telling someone 1 dollar is basically 100 yen just forget the decimal point is shit easy yeah won works not harder but easier for any mouth breathing retard
  agreed korea wins in food variety and cost but you can see everything seoul has to offer in 3 days and other locations arent worth anything more than half a day trip
  you could spend a month in tokyo and not be bored once    agree with everything up until that last point tokyo you can kinda bust through with the train system and a little planning in 2 weeks sure you can easily bust through more stuff to find in a month but really start going into niche things at that point for it to seem fresh ill completely agree with  though    i looked up doing a 10 day trip to korea filled out 4 or 5 days around seoul then kinda tried to poke through more around the country and just went scratching my head trying to find anything that wasnt  shrine 582  look at our cool manufacturing plant  look at our cool manufacturing research plant  look at our cool university research place  look at our dam  look at our recreation of shrine  shopping center    while thats probably super interesting to others its just not what i want to see both have nature both have dams both have factory tours japan though really at least tries to make something easy to get to and each city tries to have some unique thing about it you can easily figure out what the draw is in a few quick google searches on said town
  huh i dont use reddit but do u think i could get laid in korea american light brown eyes/hair 511 dress pretty well and social
  dude youre the most annoying guy on this whole board stop asking the same questions every time
  korea is a nation of frustrated weeaboos who desperately wish they could be japan but know they cant and so pretend like they never really wanted that at all honestly we hate japen really we do its actually sort of fun to observe the massive inferiority complex
  can you get laid at home
korea is a really boring country to visit japan is kinda boring too but its much cleaner and there is a lot more history and interesting sights
korea is the better place to party japan is the better place to live if youre an esl fag though korea is the better place to work at in japan you arnt glared at by old people to the western weebs who keep asking about kgirls if you are tall and white enough and not a total autist you should do good tbqh the average girl has no ass once you take their clothes off you wont get the super hot kpop looking ones if you dont speak korean but there are a lot of cute ones every korean girl wants a western guy
  every korean girl wants a western guy    im a above average looking white guy in korea and thats definitely not true lol some girls like western guys but most dont really give a shit of course if you go on tinder or foreigner bars its gonna seem like that you sound like a faggot
how much should i budget for 3 weeks in either country in summer for both countries the itinerary will mostly be the highlights and such
  after flights and train passes 1500 bucks for each should be fine japan and korea are both fairly cheap assuming you will stay in hostels they will be about 2025 bucks a day food for 2 good meals  morning breakfast 1520 beers are cheap outside bars day train passes 1520 bucks
  korea is the better place to party japan is the better place to live    never understood this unless people assume all of japan  tokyo osaka has some of the greatest night life ive experienced while traveling and there are also other places like yokohama and other stops that have good shit to be done
id like to think of it this way  week or less for a vacation  korea you can fill up around seoul on most everything you could want to do  more than a week for vacation  japan youll need to really leave tokyo to see the most of what the country has to offer and getting around is fairly easy tokyo itself should take about 5 or 6 days to get all knocked out for the main things
have you been to the another reality or something like that i think you should go i used alchemy symbols and i love the idea its a good thing that i have been do you want to come i think you should go
  i used alchemy symbols and i love the idea  use this instead 
thank you for the update and for the record i have to go to the other reality and i will be there at the same time and i will be there i think you should go
does anyone here live in argentina is it a nice place to live can a white person move there and survive
ive heard mediocre things about argentina from what ive gathered its safe and the foods good on the flip side the women there are god awful assholes to be around and their is an air of smugness because they think they are white lol
  buenos aires is a dangerous shithole full of shitskins just like every other south american city you will be mugged by two brown midgets on a motorcycle if youre not paying attention  countryside is covered in small towns of white people
  is it a nice place to live  no  can a white person move there and survive  yes  but why would you lower your life standard
  argentina is a white country 
  buenos aires is crappy and the pavements covered in dog shit
  if you want white move to montevideo equally depressing as argentina tho
  argentinian citzen used to live there until one year ago    yeah you can but it is going to be hell of a ride which part of the country are you thinking of
my sister moved from the us to ba about a decade ago she still lives there has a job got a masters degree really set up a life down there it can be done
  and their is an air of smugness because they think they are white lol    which part of the country are you thinking of  not op but what places would you recommend for living if money isnt a problem
  can a mestizo move there
is there anything worse in travel than economy seating on a long haul flight its literally hell on earth i couldnt even drug myself to sleep
  yep it pay the extra few bucks to ensure you get a window/aisle seat i also cant sleep on planes even in business lay flat seats but the extra space at least makes it more comfortable
one of the worst things that ever happened to me was a kidney stone attempting to pass my urethra in economy seating on a 6 hour flight    i survived tho
  long distance bus in indonesia  half the space you have on a plane motion sickness painfully slow everybody smoking around  economy seating is fine youre just a rich kid who is used to living in luxury
  mercy
  is there anything worse in travel than economy seating on a long haul flight    sure there could be snakes in there
  economy seating is fine  t manlet economy seating is ok for domestic flights but anything over 3 hours is hell for anyone over 6 feet
  that sounds unimaginably bad
  what a huge and novel observation airline seats are not the most comfortable way to spend time and cheaper ones are worse than more expensive ones    not sure why youd even bother posting that  of course anybody who has traveled knows it    now it may be that you are sufficiently insane to literally believe that there is nothing worse than sitting in an uncomfortable seat for 68 hours in which case i envy your amazingly low stress life or pity you your malfunctioning brain the list of things worse than that is really really long pic related exists as do flesheating bacteria and shit
  ill toss in long distance vans in sub saharan africa horrible roads horrible heat 30 people in a vehicle thats supposed to hold 10 wooden seats horrible smell airplanes are luxurious relative to the shit ive traveled in
  ive once spent 30ish hours traveling in a bus with a quality of seats lower than that you have in the photos also more cramped too so i guess there are worse things
  is there anything worse in travel than economy seating on a long haul flight  considering that air travel isnt all that affordable to begin with its far from being the worse definitely sucks to be stuck in a cramped seat for a long haul but it can be worse
  if its a flight where im crossing an ocean if i cant afford a lie flat seat i cant afford to go its that huge
allahu akhbar i am a manlet
  its not that bad im 65 and had an 11 hour flight to japan in economy and i survived just fine maybe it depends on the plane though    now being on a small boat in bad weather thats bad bumping your head while throwing up is not a good time
  fuck you i will take any long haul economy flight above that one 26 hour taxi ride with a fat woman crushing my right hip for 20 hours with only enough leg room to lift my knees 10cm  couldnt even move them back and forth or sideways
  bumping your head while throwing up is not a good time  i get airsick been there while puking in an airplane lavatory during heavy turbulence
  this desu    im 62 and while it certainly isnt as great as sitting in business its fine i just sit back and watch movies anyway
  literally hell on earth    try getting shanked in the anus and then sodomized by 10inch big black dicks for several hours straight every day until you finally die of blood loss    then tell me what is hell on earth
  where the fuck were you going that needed a 26 hour taxi ride
  grow the fuck up op unless you are taking the most budget airline possible economy is mostly fine     but i am tall and need the space  oh did you book tickets then magically grow several inches between then and booking doubt it you know what you need if you are tall or fat  arm rest area  only legit complaint one can have but get this folding your arms works 99 of the time also ask for isle or window seat at checkin get there early enough and bam youre good for one of the two often a couple is traveling and willing to trade as well  muh attendance  its the same almost every fucking area of the plane  getting off the plane is slower  gah that 1015 minutes sure is a make or break huh trip ruined if not off just before the cheap seats      you sound like someone who flies infrequent yet needs to act like flying is their life ive found the people who fly a shit ton never bring it up most the time
  jokes on you im slavic and jewey and ill gladly sacrifice personal comfort even for long periods of time to save money without caring that much
  i guess ill find out 10 hour flight in economy coming up im hoping 30mg of melatonin and 2 tylenol pm will work some magic because ive got nothing else
  fucking lol
its mostly being stuck somewhere for 10 hours plus like some caged animal with very little freedom of movement and very little to entertain myself with i cant watch movies or listen music because you have to raise the volume so much youre bound to damage your hearing its such a miserable experience altogether
im a 59 manlet and economy is ok i book a seat on the eisle though so can get up whenever to have a stretch or go to toilet
i can do around 15 hours but after that i need a stopover the worst ive ever done was uk to new zealand direct with a transit in lax     the entire flight there was some sick old man with a heavy cough in the aisle next to me it took a lot of willpower not to just strangle him 20 hours in
i must be on the spectrum because i can sit still for bne to lax no problems in economy    only hiccup once was someone moving seats into the empty one in front of me and fully reclining it he looked like a filthy semite of some kind so i simply got up and told him to put it back up or move
phft    just dont sleep the night before and instead sleep on the flight its basically teleportation
  that doesnt work and youll need 3 days to recover once you arrive at your destination
  if theres anything worse than having to deal with airports and flying its having yo deal with airports and flyinh while youre tired
  i find ecconomy on long haul comfy youre sat with people youve never met before for 13 hours but eventually youll bond in this silent friendship you may not talk to the guy sitting next to you but you got his back and hes got yours
an efficiency focused 30 hour road trip in a total shitbox of a minivan with only the most unavoidable of refuel/eat/piss breaks and a 40 minute ferry ride at least we had eight people to rotate the driving duties with and the passengers had a theoretical chance of sleeping but that didnt really make it suck any less
  i love that hardship breeds tight bonds
  just fuck up your sleep schedule so it can get even more fucked when you get jetlagged to a foreign airport  sounds like an awesome idea anon
actual tip stretch often during a long flight people might give you some weird looks but it helps a lot with the blood flow    sometimes i just go stand next to the toilets for like 15 mins  you can actually start conversations there when people ask you what youre doing
  better than two day travel by coach literal agony
    kidney stone  yeah those can be nasty    economy  fuck aare you okay man
im one of those people who can sleep anywhere anytime so im not bothered in the slightest i put on a movie and just drift off till food then repeat till arrival
im a grad student i dont mind being uncomfortable for ten or fifteen hours to get to the other side of the world to be very honest
  weird i enter instant flight coma
6mg of melatonin  easy life    im just paranoid as fuck i talk in my sleep  one time on a bus i woke up and my hand was on the leg of the old the woman sitting next to me
meh i have a lot experience staying up 24 hours   and crashing for 12 hours did for flights from la to sydney and back and managed to stay sound asleep for at least 10 hours both ways
i chow down an entire medium sized pizza from dominos minutes before a flight makes me doze off but i cant sleep while sitting at a near 90 degree angle so im in a constant sleep high that helps time pass quicker
14hr economy on air china  yeah it wasnt so bad  window seat when the chinese food hits your bowels like a freight train  jesus lord mary i had never wanted to shit so bad before airplane toilet felt like a royal throne
  tried this the last month hong kong  finland  spain around 22 hours trip  the problem was that i didnt sleep at all in the plane it was fucking hell on earth the flight from helsinki to madrid my head was going to explode and my hearth was doing something strange my face was so fucking fucked up that even the flight attendant asked me if i was ok  not anymore man
  how do you sleep theres nowhere to put your head everytime im drifting off my head falls forward and wakes me up
  reminder that 1st class is the least safe place on a plane if it goes down
  domestic trans con eg sfojfk is the one i dread the most shitty domestic carrier with shitty planes etc
yeah the luggage compartment
  how clean are airplane toilets in general  spoileralso where do they fush the shit/spoiler
  if you could fly directly from europe to sea would you do it to keep the travel short or would you choose to stop in uae or some shit to stretch your legs for an hour or two
  try  i think ill pass you do you though
  are you the guy who had the 45 minute connection that then got changed to a normal one
  depends on the flight length i can handle a 68 hour flight but after that it starts taking its toll  i would rather be able to leave a messy plane and have a chance to freshen up eat something decent and stretch my legs before boarding a clean plane instead of putting up with it for another 6 hours
  would you  i recommend getting up occasionally and walking around i know this behavior might be a bit unusual on western carriers but on many asian carriers with high amounts of asian passengers this is completely commonplace and normal  not to mention the inflight services are usually better in the best asian carriers too
anyone ever fly with turkish airlines recently and had to sit through that retarded lego film
i had a hemorrhoid and had to travel from rome to los angeles via chicago on united all in economy flight was continuously delayed and it took 24 hours to get home worst flight experience in my life overall economy is not that bad
  that doesnt work and youll need 3 days to recover once you arrive at your destination    the fuck
if its under 12 hours just deal with it    once you get past that threshold thoughits not pleasant theres really nothing you can do just deal with it
  why are dominos pizzas so small they taste really bland i have no idea how that concept isnt dead
how can americans always have benzos for flights my doctor would never get me any benzos for a flight
  flew cathay pacific once from la to hk   was not disappoint
  gabu guineabissau to conakry idiot wrecked my motorbike and there were no parts to fix it in the entire country except all the way back in bissau
  ask for isle or window seat at checkin    do that when you first book the tickets on most airlines
  i wouldnt worry about it excessively    i have never been able to sleep on a plane or in a car or just sitting up at all so i get ready to travel knowing that if i have a longass flights particularly overnight im just going to be awake for awhile    watch movies listen to music read the time passes as time always does    ill generally try and sleep late/go to bed early for a few days before long flights and try to have essentially nothing to do but laze around my first day at my destination if at all possible    i have a prescription for ambien which i use the first few nights in a new time zone to help fall asleep according to the new schedule other than that ive never had too much trouble with jetlag so thats good
  noise cancelling headphones/ear buds the cheap taotronic ones work wonders the buds work better than headphones naturally the difference between switching them on and off when the engines are going is like night and day i wear them constantly once on board and they work unplugged or when watching a movie/music    t several 910hr flights using now
  many airlines charge for selected seating
  its mostly being stuck somewhere for 10 hours plus like some caged animal with very little freedom of movement and very little to entertain myself with     if you are likely to be awake get that aisle seat and move around when the opportunity arises better than nothing    i cant watch movies or listen music because you have to raise the volume so much youre bound to damage your hearing    the fuck are you on about can you converse with the person in the next seat without screaming at the top of your lungs into his ear yeah then you can set your headphones at a louder than usual but not deafening level and enjoy your movie t every other traveler on the plane all of us with our earphones on enjoying the movie non of us going deaf en route    its such a miserable experience altogether    its not ideal how miserable it is can be more your call than you seem to realize
heres some nightmare fuel for you guys    
  sure they also charge for a ticket    i look at it like part of the cost of flying somewhere it is usually a small fraction of what you are paying for your travels worth it to me    but yeah if you chose to just take what they give you and save some money it is definitely worth asking about when you check in and again at the gate
  when they start to recline youll also have the back of the guy in front of you
  how clean are airplane toilets in general  it varies  as a general rule they are pretty clean when the flight starts and slowly degrade over time on long flights    spoileralso where do they fush the shit/spoiler        also spoiler spoiler tags dont work here /spoiler
  i think maybe what he meant is if it doesnt work your running on 2 days without sleep plus whatever jet lag does to you and are going to feel like shit for the first days of your trip    maybe    or maybe hes just the guy who thinks you cant use earphones on a plane without rupturing your eardrums
  freedom mufugga
  ad im 65 and had an 11 hour flight to japan in economy  hahahah fuck man
  idk i find it way easier to get over jet lag if youre absolutely exhausted the last time i flew transatlantic i stayed up for 36 hours couldnt sleep on my red eye far too turbulent and by the time i checked into my hotel at 4pm and woke up no problem at 7am local time
    just got back from ist yesterday flew the istanbulchicago direct flight   didnt catch any of that safety vid immediately put on my noise canceling headphones and started chillin on my ipad      incidentally i flew biz class going to ist and back caught food poisoning either from the flight meals or the lounge at the airport i was in the last row of the biz class section and there was a baby in the first row of economy so i had to deal with a crying kid for most of the flight also some econo passengers kept entering the biz cabin to use our bathrooms the cabin crew was doing nothing to keep der unterclassen away from us
  that sucksss    i travel first class wherever i go
12 hour flight from frankfurt to vancouver  came down with mysterious illness the night before  nose wont stop dripping  passing in and out of consciousness due to lack of sleep  sneeze at one point while still asleep  shoot blood everywhere   severe stomach pains    they gave me so many antibiotics when i landed and made vancouver immigration even funner than it normally is
  fuck those entitled plebs who try to use business class bathrooms often its someone with a little kid  i have my crotchfruit with me so the rules dont apply
  long distance bus in indonesia  half the space you have on a plane motion sickness painfully slow everybody smoking around  short distance bus in indonesia  all the above except the driver has a death wish
    the stranger sitting next to you could be too fat to fit in their seat thereby spilling over into yours
    i tried this on 19 hour flight from bangkok  beijing long layover  lax    i ended up staying wide awake for about 44 hours straight because i couldnt catch a single wink on any of the planes and when i got home it was already 1 pm so it didnt make sense to sleep so early and i was oddly energized
  the best noise cancelling headphones cost as much as one long distance economy ticket pay for themselves very quickly it baffles me that there are people in business class that use shitty headphones per dollar noise cancelling headphones have to be the best way of improving flight comfort
  dont most business class offerings have complimentary noise cancelling headphones for rent gratis    also why use noise cancelling headphones when you can just use hearing protection
  every business class flight ive been on has had them available at the seat before i entered the plane or handed out by the flight attendant shortly after i sat down quality depends on the airline though evas headphones are the best ive used so far jals were disappointing considering i was in first on that flight
  19 hours how was it 19 17 is the top of the list longest flight in the world
  because you cant watch a movie or listen to music with hearing protection
  he said layover and the longest flight in the world is now around 19 hours it was launched recently singaporenew york
  earbuds  hearing protection
  definitely autstic but not for the reason you think
is there some kind of legal drug i can take that will put me to sleep guaranteed    i was fine flying when i was younger but now that im older i had a few bad experiences where the plane bumped around too much and im scared shitless the moment i step on a plane now i just try to stop myself from screaming or looking crazy when the turbulence starts
  you can try nyquil although ive taken nyquil before a redeye and it was turbulent all the way across the fucking atlantic it was a strange feeling being forced into wanting to go to sleep by the drugs and it being nighttime and being jostled awake all night
  i recommend taking melatonin or 5htp my personal favorite right before your flight 5htp let me sleep soundly and i have sleeping problems generally from the midwest over to scandinavia on a red eye
  long distance bus in indonesia  half the space you have on a plane    why not take the luxury bus for the extra 5    i took many overnight busses in asia and the vip busses have seats that recline almost horizontal super comfy    super comfy assuming you trust the driver not to fall asleep and drive the bus off a cliff at 4am
  read a book you stupid nigger
anybody do this or have stories to share seems like a liberating way to travel met a guy in montenegro who had travelled on a bike from china to manchester    even if its just a few states or a couple countries in europe i would love to do more trips on two wheels new zealand or south america comes to mind    pic related its my uncle in alaska
  it wears on your ass after a few hours but motorcycles are fun
ive been through a lot of vietnam  super easy because they dont care about insurance/license ect  hard to do in 1st world countries
did 2 months in vietnam/cambodia/laos on a 110cc honda blade scooter  was lots of fun  a those countries are great for riding around you have freedom fuel is cheap hostels/hotels are everywhere roads are pretty good for the most part there is tourism infrastructure     also just finished a 1 month long trip in india/nepal on a royal enfield 350cc classic started in calcutta rode up to darjeeling then into nepal  kathmandu  pokhara then back into india agra/delhi    india i dont like as much roads are much worse they have speed bumps everywhere as i guess no one follows speed limits even on highways and expressways which can come as a bit of a surprise if your not paying attention traffic is just worse in vietnam there is a logic and rules to the chaos you see bikes stick to edge of road for example does not really apply in india people just do whatever cows in middle of the road trucks and buses everywhere also the poverty is some thing you see a lot more on a bike i took wrong turns and would end up in slums that were literal sewers  rubbish everywhere kids  cows its really confronting but hey the freedom is cool there are hotels pretty much everywhere and the standard isnt western but its improving

germany has the best clubs and nightlife not only berlin but pretty much every city has its good places to go     worst experience was tokyo great locations and good music but you have to pay around 30 for entry and of all guests maybe 10 are female but the culture is different they dont go to dance with each other everyone is focusing on the stage and the dj its like a concert
  sydney  hahahahahahahahaha hahahah hahahahahaha hahahaha hah hah heh oh man     t melbourne
whats the nightlife like in dublin
anyone got any tips for nightlife in berlin how easy is it to my sweaty palms on some mdma as a solo traveler
my parents are leaving for puerto plata in a couple days and i want them to bring me back a box of cigars where can i tell them to go to find the best cigars for a reasonable/cheap price    i did some research online and all the advertised retailers cater to tourists so their prices are going to be inflated my dad is latin american and should have no trouble getting around or haggling with vendors
just get yourself one of them ecigarettes aka douche flutes aka vaporsticks    it wont make you a smug libtard just healthier    its like switching from a benzine car to a hydrogen one    but thats just me do whatever the hell you want
  i dont smoke cigarettes but i like to have a cigar once in a while i know there a lot worst then cigarettes
  of course theyre aimed at tourists the best cigars in the dr are for the export market if you just want cheap nicotine you can get that anywhere    smug libtard  vaping is for the redpill mgtow crowd though what planet are you living on
  well if its anything luke cuba a lot locals would be cigar smokers too
  mommy and daddy bring me big brown cigar bbc
  yes and the local cigars in cuba are not amazing theyre adequate for impoverished third worlders but i assume the premise of buying cigars on vacation is not to get something adequate for impoverished third worlders
hi guys pretty simple concept    do you have any suggestions for what to do in tokyo during christmas and new years ive already got a list going but keen to hear some of your ideas

hey guys  im going to vienna this week for 4 days and youve never disappointed me with great and authentic advice    so im looking for tips of bars activities general places the kind of things that are diamonds in the rough that people that lived there for a long time end up taking you  my main objective is to have a chill not posh authentic experience of vienna    thanks
  reminds me of the vostok map in the original counter strike they dont make em like they used to
start by going to the bermuda triangle around schwedenplatz for bar hopping and go to grinzing for wine and schnitzels
hey /trv/    any older anons here that traveled in the 80s90s and early 2000s what were your experiences like back then for each of those countries you visited have you visited them again what was different what was traveling like without a cellphone without the internet to book hostels/hotels    sorry if i am being naive but i have been enamored by the destinations i visited and how different they were back then    i ask this because my hick of a coworker surprised me by saying he went to china in the 80s and i dogged him how he should have went to thailand because youll get your worth for a graduation present only for him to tell me thailand was communist back then which made me realize how popular destinations were not really travel destinations like iceland    also watching eurotrip and the spanish apartment really brought up my interest in the past
  india was bizarre in the early nineties no imported stuff all the cars were morris minor clones all the big motorbikes were enfield india the scooters were only bajaj vespa clones and some honda kinetics    things were amazingly cheap and everybody carried lonely planet books around you were an easy target for touts since you did not always know where the hotels were     then you go to thailand and everything is ultra clean all of a sudden unfortunately i never went to cambodia i believe one could still hear gunfire in phnom penh at night then 1994 was the last year the khmer rouge killed westerners some poor fuckers that got taken off a train close to kampot at least there was no tuol sleng active then i hope they werent tortured to death like those poor hippies whose boat drifted into cambodian waters in the seventies the interrogation protocols are still available very creepy reading
  continued  to make a call abroad from india youd have to go to a phone office and pay dearly the lines were often shitty the hustler whod do the dialling would often delay handing over the phone to you since hed make xx rupees more for every extra minute that was put on the bill    one big difference is that nobody that travelled then did anything reasonable with their time now i travel with a laptop and work like im in the west in those days youd run around looking for paperbacks drugs or anything to kill time in the long run it would make you feel quite mentally fragile    people generally always took trains then because the budget airlines had not arrived youd spend days going from north to south india then days on buses then days on trains going back lots of time spent travelling     people had less attitude then there were religious seekers there were general backpackers but nobody acted like modern day instagram posers
my grandfather traveled to calcutta to work with mother teresa in the late 80s his job was just to care for the dying in the hospice his hotel room was 25 cents a night ill ask him any questions if anybody is interested he talks about his days in vietnam for than this he saw some shit no doubt
i remember when traveling around europe each country felt like a whole new world passport controls having to exchange currency at every border
    please do    also op here ever since i visted iceland it made me wonder what iceland was like before tourism was an industry there i know iceland was really devastated by the us 2008 housing crash    like ive seen really really old photos of iceland but nothing contemporary like 90s2000s closest i can find was like concert bjork played in their concert halls    id share but im relatively young and all i can recall that was different was we used my shitty verizon gps that had to road visuals but just had what to do
  tourism was big in the 90s already and their own crash had nothing to do with the us housing crash do you think they are a us colony or something
  us 2008 housing crash  that started in iceland so it should be iceland 2008 housing crash
  iceland had prohibition up until 1989
youd always have to rely on a travel agent to book flights they usually had one or two options top for a given destination and the fare grid was pretty much revised only once a year   also plane tickets were a big deal as you needed the original to check in a flight so whenever you had booked well in advance youd need to keep your ticket like a treasure reissuance incurred a fee and some paperwork  security was a lot more lax and no one had electronics until late 90s so the x ray screening was half assed blurrier than a baby ultrasound  atm werent so commonly available and youd often need to travel with a lump of cash and exchange whenever possible or order currency at your bank several days if not weeks in advance or use travelers cheques  you were not able to check current exchange rates so youd be even more fucked over than nowadays  you wouldnt hear of what happened at home unless a big international news it was basically a surprise upon your return checking on friends browsing the post mail youd received listening to your home phone answering machine
  only on beer stronger stuff was perfectly legal
      no not at all from what i have read the icelandic banks put money on something about the housing market in the us then the us housing market crashed and the icelandic banks lost money
  lots ofbanks worldwide and most european banks lost incredible money after the subprimes crisis

  i thought they were pretty but i also thought it was rather sad to see all those large raptors locked up in cages that gave them only enough room to glide a few feet why not just taxidermy them and tell people see this is what an eagle looks like    pic semirelated its a raptor
whats the happiest country youve been to /trv/ or rather what country have you been to which has the happiest people in and not just generic friendly to tourist but general happy people consistently
nz and 2 isnt even close
  maybe fiji or nepal
  i disagree
  i concur
  bullshit kiwis are miserable assholes
people seemed pretty happy in the philippines
people outside the cities in the usa midwest people are so happy and down to earth
ive traveled through every continent besides antarctica and i would have to say south korea
happy tourism me finland  happy people norway
unironically i found brazil to be as happy as its made out to be i was only in rio though cant think of a happier place except anywhere during new years eve
  the dominican republic
  lmao what    2 of the most depressing countries
im currently in bhutan not as a tourist living here for 6 months through a university program the people here are very relaxed and happy
  was going to mention bhutan but you beat me to it they literally have the concept of gross national happiness
   they literally have the concept of gross national happiness    which means if you say you are unhappy you go to jail
americans and cambodians are pretty chill and very friendly heard good things about oman jordan bhutan and nepal mongolia etc
oman or malawi
so im a newfag to travelling so i thought id ask for some suggestions im a student in the uk and ill have saved up around 1k pounds at the start of the summer give me some good travel locations around europe  nature landmarks mostly not too big a fan of historical places/old cities/ etc preferred method of travel is train
  switzerland have the bast train tracks and the alps landmarks are strong 10/10 but it isnt that cheap lmao
  europe  nature  lol  hop a flight to canada or the us instead all europe has is tundra in the far north the swiss alps too expensive or gems like in your pic that youll get mugged and raped to death before you ever see fly into nyc and take a train an hour north and youll be in the catskills
  why would he be mugged and raped to death in the albanian alps lets say it was an american and not a low test cucked britt the amerilard should be fine right
  lard  estrogen so no
  i guess you missed the part where i said 1k pounds is all ill have
  not a britbong just a student there
anyone here been to all 50 states how would one prepare for such a roadtrip
  anyone here been to all 50 states  not all of them but have driven across the country coast to coast and up n down it too   how would one prepare for such a roadtrip  good car budget of about 5 grand understanding sleeping in your car is dumb and good amount of music to listen to many times youll be driving through farmland
i have but not all at once     decent car good tires aaa membership
  aaa membership  this will pay for itself in the first call plus it gets you discounts
  state lines are so arbitrary why not spend your time making memories in unique places rather than spending 5 hours driving through the unscenic nothingness of north dakota
how the fuck are you going to roadtrip to hawaii
  i wont drive to hawaii but i will drive around hawaii   i will take the ferry to alaska though
  i agree with this anon trying to hit all 50 states in one go just means youre going to he sacrificing time and experiences just to complete a check list  alaska can and should be a month long trip by itself
sure ive been to all 50 plus some of the possessions but not all at once and not purely by driving a lot of it was flying into a city spending some time there and renting a car and visiting the neighboring area    if you do want to take a lengthy road trip be sure to get enough sleep falling asleep at the wheel risks more than just _your_ life
  honestly the ferry ride is cool but road tripping to and from alaska in my shitbox chevy was some of the most fun ive ever had
    im actually planning on making a documentary about zoos in the united states so i might not actually go to all 50 states since wyoming has no zoo     which is more economical honestly how do i give the alaska trip justice too how is the culinary scene there
  well in peak season it can cost up to 2000 to get your car on the ferry it depends on the length and that doesnt include a ticket for the driver  it takes about a week to drive to anchorage from montana or washington but if you camp along the way you and your car gets good mileage you can easily get there for less than half the ferry ride objectively the cheapest way is flying one thing that people do when theyre headed up for summer seasonal gig is buy a cheap used car drive it up there and then sell it at the end of the season and fly or take the ferry back any running car is worth at least a thousand dollars in alaska regardless of overall condition  youll definitely want some kind of vehicle while youre there though because alaska is fucking huge and travel expenses can rack up fast if youre taking the train or local flights hitchhiking is still quite common though  the culinary scene really varies from place to place obviously lots of fresh seafood on the coast big chains in the cities etc the beer scene is blowing up breweries are opening all over the place
  how would one prepare for such a roadtrip  to all 50 states  once you arrive on the west coast get some aftermarket mods to your carrun a telescoping rod and sail through the sun roof and attach hooks for inflatable pontoons around the fenders you should reach the big island in about a month just fish and use your phone gps to stay on course
i drive a semi truck ive been to 48 but alaska is on my to do list eventually after i get alaska i might as well go to hawaii just to say ive been to every state
  im actually planning on making a documentary about zoos in the united states  what the fuck anon why
american tourism is nothing more than crossing arbitrary lines on a map    oh no    oh no no pfpfphahahah
  dubs wasted
  why the fuck not
  keep on trucking anon
  why is definitely the right question why
  how would one prepare for such a roadtrip  find your starting city then make a sort of loop around the country with obvious curves to account for states in the middle of the nation plan out which cities/towns you wanna stop at or what national monuments you wanna see when youre in each state identify local must haves when youre there ie rocky mountain oysters in co lobster in me for alaska and hawaii fly there on another date
  state lines are so arbitrary     no they arent
i did it truck driver i really took my time to enjoy it i would say its a worthwhile thing to do    gotta fly to hawaii and probably alaska but neither really feel american the way the continental us does could skip them if youre just looking an american experience
  i lost my interest in zoos when i was like eight just wondering why youre so interested in them and why youre doing them in all 50 states
  earth tourism is is nothing more than crossing arbitrary lines on a map    oh no no no
  how is the culinary scene there  pretty much nonexistent
      zoos are way interesting
  this is what we should spend our big gov bucks on    a giant road from ca to hawaii 3 lanes both ways with a combo gas station/motel every 30 miles
how about a trip to all 50 us states plus unincorporated territories puerto rico us virgin islands american samoa etc
  when you start including the islands without any civillian population it gets tricky for a while the oceanic society was running tours to midway but that was shut down    me i still have to get to amereican samoa it looks like there are flights to pago pago from honolulu but im not sure where to go from there
  wyoming has no zoo  huh any particular reason why it doesnt
  its the least populous of the 50 states and its few cities are tiny
  yeah but if montana and rhode island have zoos the former is pretty empty and the latter is often compared to my country in size and we have zoos    but okay then i thought there was maybe some law prohibiting zoos in wyoming or something    brb i have a /biz/ idea for wyoming
  every thirty miles  fuck that shit they dont need it more than every hundred
  imagine trying to work at one of those gas station/motels    the job would be just as shitty as a regular gas station or motel if not worse you would also not be able to go home as often
im moving to the aforementioned country in a month and would appreciate any insight comment recommendations etc of what ill encounter anything you feel i should know please share also politically incorrect remarks are more than welcomed ive done research on the country on forums and such but i want /trv/s take on it  im in my mid 20s caucasian dont speak polish though i intend on being a1 most basic to get around before i arrive   psmandatory question how easy are the girls
polish girls are huge sluts they arent that open about it tho as western girls
  what approach would you recommend hows tinder there
  might find someone to answer that question in the tinder thread i never used it i just go to bars and try to strike up a conversation or someone starts talking to you because they see or hear that youre a foreigner thats how it is for me tho had some great evenings that way and nice girls
  why are you moving there
  i need a breath of fresh air no reason in particular really i can still work remotely salary paid in euros etc i was certain id go to belgium namur to practice my french but the cost of living in poland is just too appealing
  how easy are the girls  they put out at the drop of a hat if you are from a more western country you have about 3x more money than they have also just as in russia the men are not the attractive ones
plfag here  i must say that i confirm former anons replies many polish girls will put it out easily when they find out youre foreigner from western country the reason is simple  most people here earn something like 700 eur or less and western europe is considered as much better place to live  they may expect persistent relationship get tinder pro to find out by yourself before arriving you should try ukraine as well girls are imo prettier there and costs of living are even lower  average salary there is around 200 there country is less developed but still good enough to live especially when you earn good amount much more corruption that i assume you do remote job  software dev    feel free to ask further questions
  i need a breath of fresh air  just so you know poland has the worst air pollution in europe    ah yes living in poland while earning a western wage is living life in easy mode personally as a polfag i would prefer going to asia instead but thats just me poland is a bit cold to me both in actual temperatures and the people there its also a generally boring stiff country on a world scale but then again most of europe is as a positive dating is easy if you have money and you dont even have to learn polish in fact you want to target girls who speak a foreign language that you speak the girls who dont speak a second language in poland are trashtier in the major cities practically all young people speak a second language to a certain extent especially if you live/hang around a university
not to hijack the thread but im also travelling to poland early december and would appreciate advice/survival tips for zakopane and especially krakow are there any places one could safely store his luggage assuming ones hostel is unsafe and dont want to change it seems no cancellation policies are common    and by western does that include maltese i dont look like a poo and i have an american accent should i just lie and tell them im from commiefornia or florida
  im not polish but the only maltese guy i know was with a polish girl most polish girls ive known have preferred medlooking guys too so i think youll be good
  thank you thats a relief i am wellkept also so hopefully that works in my favour heard polish girls prefer more maturelooking guys    any other advice for safety and security
  you can leave luggage in train stations its not free but the fees are not huge by western standards the hostels in poland are just as safe as ones in other countries        i also know 1 maltese guy who is with a polish girl they live in australia
  sweet i appreciate it i know hostels tend to be safe but i was juggling several bookings that were on their last availabilities so i booked a hostel that had mediocre reviews i just want a possible out in case my room has a security issue it definitely wont fit in a backpack locker but i read theres a guarded office for larger luggage its only 2 days    much appreciated im really looking forward to it
  would it be stupid to spend all my time in warsaw
  oh god yes  thats the biggest shithole there    krakkow lodz gdynia anything is better than warsaw
  dont learn polish it is too hard to learn moreover it is spoken only in poland and poland is depopulating and it is a shithole so polish language is not important and will probably never be  t pole
how do the polish view asians im japanese american i just want to know what my chances there are
  masz racje kurwa    i am an expat and ive stopped trying to meet with girls on tinder because it became too exhausting maintaining 3 fuckbuddies
  if you look like a kpop star youll drown in pussy  if you look like emperor akihito dont expect much
  good to know how are they in terms of openess and all that more than willing to just make friends would the usual meeting in bar thing work any other country
  you should try ukraine as well girls are imo prettier there    the grass is always greener   i speak only very basic words in polish should i expect to be treated impolitely/scammed/attacked i do enjoy going for a pint for myself some nights would that be dangerous
  just so you know poland has the worst air pollution in europe  holy shit cackled hard
      holy shit its true  they have 33 of the top 50 most polluted towns in europe     i also have a feeling that this entire thread was started to tease our resident polack polfag that pollutes //trv threads hes kod now for sure    what good is the altrighter dream of a catholic polish wife if she dies before the age of 30
  thanks for getting the joke its hard to convey deadpan comedy online      yeah man the north is mostly fine its the southern part especially in silesia thats really bad they use coal to heat buildings and sometimes just burn garbage not common but does happen in places like katowice krakow lodz or even warsaw the smog gets really bad from when it starts to get cold in around midseptember or earlyoctober to late spring    i also have a feeling that this entire thread was started to tease our resident polack polfag that pollutes //trv threads  i think theres a bunch of us here i havent lived in poland for 20 years now i dont think i would want to its great to visit but the country is pretty shit to spend significant time in
  interesting btw how cold does it get will i be shivering every time i step outside during any season but summer or its not that bad do people often get around by bicycle or are the roads dangerous/shitty drivers    i dont think i would want to its great to visit but the country is pretty shit to spend significant time in  ive gotten that from lots of polfags but hey ive never been outside the west i want to experience new cultures and shit im a fucking stuck up entitled western snob who needs a slap in the face desu
  how cold does it get  poland gets the traditional 4 seasons warm to hot summers slowly cooling and somewhat wet falls cold to very cold winters and then mild springs in the winter it really depends on the year sometimes you get the years where you have a bit of 20 weather while other years it gets down to 5 or 10 at worst and only for short periods but yes prepare for a real winter    do people often get around by bicycle or are the roads dangerous/shitty drivers   cycling not as popular as in netherlands or denmark but some people do ride my cousin rides to work outside of winter months traffic is pretty bad in cities so riding a bike is actually not a bad way to get across town    im a fucking stuck up entitled western snob who needs a slap in the face desu  meh poland is fairly mild in that aspect if you want to experience the east at least go to ukraine if you really want to experience the east go live in georgia or moldova or romania if youre coming from western europe or north america or australia going to poland is kinda boring the people will seem cold and unfriendly they complain a lot theres a lot of bureaucracy a lot of closed minded people who think they arent you might even come across people who will be jealous of your status/wealth as a westerner and will try to make your life worse out of spite    this is why i said id rather move to asia people there seem a lot friendlier even if theyre poor they still still have a positive outlook they smile but poland is a good step out of the ordinary as well if you dont want to just jump head first into something completely foreign
being a guy who doesnt really do expensive attractions nor buy tons of souvenirs would 1300 pln be enough for 4 and a half days flights and lodging is already paid for so its separate im quite conservative when it comes to spending when abroad
  yeah definitely enough eat in milk bars bar mleczny where you get cheap everyday type of polish food which is actually very good its ridiculously cheap to eat in those places also look for restaurants near universities i remember visiting my cousin when he was in uni and we went to eat out a lot cause it was like 1015zl for a really good meal food in general is fairly cheap in poland as is transport both local and long distance you might pay a bit for entrance fees those can add up fast but 1300zl will last you ages the minimum monthly wage after taxes is something like 1600zl /
  wow i see cause i dont want to end up exchanging too much and risk either getting robbed or bringing back a ton of money and getting fucked by exchange rates maybe 250 euro 1k pln would be more reasonable ill have a visa on me
      thats what happens when you have a country run by rightwing retards that dont care for the environment at all and put no sensible regulations on the coal industry
  muh nazis
  i would then bring like 300 or something i can barely recall places that didnt accept cards in warsaw
  do hookers take credit cards
  yeah im bringing 300 i have another question in case its not snowing enough to be able to skii or its full or whatever reason i find myself with hours to spare and nothing to do can i just kinda walk off into the forest    malta only green areas are either manicured to shit and/or are picnic areas covered in people and trash then the only other trees youll find are a by the roadside that are almost black from the smog while i have traveled before the concept of having access to a natural forest is still fairly new and exciting for me so i want the freedom to just keep walking to the south and into a forest at the base of the mountains    can i do this and what is recommended if i do so aside from light food/water and a compass in case i get actually lost
  use your common sense and judgement but really it depends where you are there are definitely dive bars that really only for local polish men where you would not be welcome    and i can tell you horror stories really about violence from just a month of living in kielce but persistently poles tell me that that town has a particularly bad reputation so what happens there might not happen elsewhere aside one basically ok bar there  not hostile open to men and women foreigners and poles  had a table that anyone who wasnt the local mafia were not advised to sit at so watch for that too     basically dont go to some provincial hellhole filled with violent xenophobic drunks and it should be ok
  i though the coal thing was a leftover from the communist era
  poland still burns a lot of coal and im not just talking about the women
girlfriend wants us to go ive never been     should i go
she wants the bgcso no
guatemala is really nice
  its a shithole and they dont like white people neither does any native/mestizo majority country in latin america  the rural areas are safe but the city isnt  if you speak spanish it will go a long way    your gf is probably a hoe see   shes be disappointed tho most guys there are ugly chubby and shorter than 55
  you guys will have fun see antigua tikal maybe semuc champey if you want something different take pics and never go back
  t have never been to latin america    they all suck up to the white man
i felt safer in guatemala than i did in belize which is supposedly a less dangerous country most of the major tourist attractions like the mayan ruins have armed rangers/cops everywhere to discourage vandalism and poaching ie protect tourists and their money just dont wander around cities by yourself
    the world is big and beautiful i just dont understand why visiting a dangerous empoverished destination when there are so many better alternatives nearby what the fuck peru and chile are right there if youre looking for something exotic and without the risk of getting robbed/raped/beaten to death for walking through the wrong neighborhood
  kek why are people so uninformed here
  sodont go outside there is risk everywhere just dont be a dumbfuck and take basic precautions       surprised belize felt more dangerous than guate always heard it was the other way around will consider that
highland guatemala is super safe certainly by latin american let alone central american standards the lowlands are still a lot safer than el salvador or honduras theres really nothing to see south or east of guatemala city anyway    ps there are parts of guatemala city and suburbs you could mistake for the us even normal parts of guatemala city are fine during the day it has a really good bus system
  this is true guatemala is fairly safe have spent lots of time down in the area it is a great place for adventurous young travelers who have at least some prior backpacking or other world experience for a complete begimner you might be in over your head its a very diverse country with lots of opportunity for fun and adventure but dont expect much rest or comfort
  peru and chile are right there  ha ha fuckin what
  agree with this
  anywhere south of the border is near eachother to americans lol
im planning to spend about 45 weeks in guatemala and belize what are the best places for jungle hiking mountain/volcano hiking and generally enjoying scenic nature in guate i know about the places to see ruins and i dont really care much about cities or indigenous culture    also besides snorkelling and the atm cave whats the best thing to do in belize best place to get a jungle hut/lodge or similar    i dont dive btw
so im waiting to board a flight from frankfurt to chicago   a security agent went around to everyone at the gate to check passports and do a mini interview where are you coming fromwhat were you doing therehow old were you when your passport photo was taken  ive never had this happen before anyone seen this before while traveling its unsettling me
weird usually they bee line straight to the brown guy
  weird  was this a police officer/border control guard    seems pretty weird as unless youre just about to board you might not be at the gate/waiting area      speaking of which as anybody gotten their carry ons checked during a normal check and after presenting a boarding pass/passport but before you enter the airplane at the jet bridge
  ive had this once before also when flying to the usa uk here usually they do it when youre in line to check in though and solely on usabound flights
  speaking of which as anybody gotten their carry ons checked during a normal check and after presenting a boarding pass/passport but before you enter the airplane at the jet bridge    ive had that a couple of times too i had the dreaded ssss on my boarding pass
  did they also put some sort of sticker on your passport i had an interview and a sticker when i flew out of frankfurt
  yes again going to the us they also used this as an excuse to discard passengers sodas that were purchased after passing security
some power playing shit checked my paper thin wallet once i dont know what the fuck she thought she would find in there all i had was my cards and some receipts and when she obviously found nothing she took a whole 5 minutes just turning it into her hands after i remarked on the absurdness of the situation   are they trying to bait people into acting up so that they can detain them
this is completely normal for any usbound flight
  not exactly this but i was randomly selected in frankfurt flying back to chicago after spending 2 weeks in tajikistan and flying through istanbul during the military coup a couple years back i am a 66 white dude and the guy in front of me was indian/paki and didnt speak english or german and was trying to get some huge shampoo containers through security and the guard was getting short with him it took 30 mins i was getting pissed flight was boarding in 5 mins and still waiting so i asked the guard with a machine gun behind him if i could show him my bag/electronics and be on my way so i didnt miss my flight he said yeah weve been watching you youre good to go  germany has had the strictest security i have ever experienced in my travels except for this one dude
its only on flights to the us or israel
  germany has had the strictest security i have ever experienced    lmfao really  im a black dude from brazil with dreadlocks and i was let inside germany in less than 5 min but this was back in 2013 so maybe things were different then
  assuming your papers and travel plans were in order why would they not let you in
this happens often enough i guess flight crew and ground staff just want to make sure all your things are in order airlines get penalized when they land with passengers with faulty visas false or lack of documentation
  ive had lots of problems entering the us even though all of my papers/passport were on point and i was there on a business trip sent by my company i dont want to be that guy but its likely because of my nationality    i was extremely surprised how nonjudgmental german agents and the people in general were
  its the mentality difference between european and american officials europeans just want to see you are going to follow the rules americans start with the assumption you are a criminal and you need to convince them otherwise
  well its very rude
  same here only happened once when going to the us really weird guys asking whats my home town like i said its alright weve got a spoons and a tenpin and they guy asks me whats a spoons i thought he was british by his accent which made it weirder
  frankfurt did anyway everyone had to completely empty all of their bags full body scanner and in some cases plus a full body patdown very thorough i guess the procedures were standard it just felt like they did everything in a rougher more comprehensive way much more to it than in somewhere like heathrow/other european airports
oh grow up op its obvious you dont fly often this shit has been going on for years in all countries forever its just a completely random thing to be selected or not it takes like 3 minutes to answer very basic questions    where are you coming fromwhat were you doing therehow old were you when your passport photo was taken  holy shit not 3 questions vacation ruined    ive never had this happen before anyone seen this before while traveling its unsettling me  have you never flown out of the eu before       you just werent randomly selected    they always spot check in any and every country if you are an eu citizen and going to another eu state rules are different domestic and international flights have different rules as well
  immigration and customs doing their job is rude    fly to japan you generally get asked far more questions china is a different ballpark if actively going into the country going to a south american country can be hell depending where you stop     spot checking is random and completely impossible to check everyone in a detailed format for any sizable country thats why its random sometimes you wont get asked anything other times they may want to check your bag and other times they will just ask you if funds are available within the country    last time i was in japan i got asked what my job was where i was going and proof of funds then got asked if my bag could be opened other times they just asked me what i was planning to do for the 10 days i was there
    im the black dude mentioned earlier    heres what it was like for me to enter germany    arrive  people without eu passports told to follow line x  follow line x this was in frankfurt too btw  go through a very light and fast patdown and x ray  go to immigration  agent asks me what im going to do in germany and how long i plan on staying literally only these 2 questions  literally reply with i didnt even want to come company sent me about 3 weeks heres my contract with x firm in germany  agent literally laughs and stamps my passport  have gut taime in gormoney broken german accent    it literally took 5 minutes  ive had a really good impression of germans compared to americans after traveling to germany for me i try to avoid flying to the us as much as i can just too much of a hassle really      and proof of funds    funny  this is asked even before applying for a visa if you come from brazil and want to visit/do whatever in japan so i was never offended by it just assumed it was normal for everyone
  interesting how different travelers all have different experiences i am sure it very much depends on the individuals working that day maybe i got the hardasses and you got the cool dudes
  its because the checking of things is random meaning that it could happen to some anons but not others ive read about some anons not being able to go into countries without showing a return ticket but ive never been asked for a return ticket ever
  when i was leaving dushanbe tajikistan after about 2 weeks there i had to declare how much money i had i gave the guy a rough estimate and he gestured that he wanted me to show him proof he spoke no english i dont speak tajik/russian/uzbek  i showed him i had about 100 bucks us and about 15 bucks us value in tajik somoni  he proceeded to reach in and take my somoni  not sure why he didnt take the us i think its illegal to use it there i wanted to take different denominations of somoni bills home to keep but i wasnt about to get into a fight with the security dude i was violently ill with the shits and just wanted to get the hell out of there thankfully i had a few bills and a couple coins in my checked bag and i guess the dude made an extra hundred bucks that day everything was so cheap there i had spent far less than expected anyway
  the chinese did that to me transferring in beijing     made me throw away 20 worth of sealed bottles i bought from at the gate before boarding    no explanation just a smug grin
  technically speaking you do need either an onward or return ticket  i think its always better to play safe and have one or the other
  security to get on the plane is much tighter than to get into the country
  never been asked i always book a round trip though only people ive heard needing to prove it is when they cant explain what they plan to do in the country or backpacker types
one time i was in schipol and i went through the xray backscatter and i had a clear plastic sandwich wrapper in my pocket that cost me 10 minutes and a full pat down and a visibly angry security staff  moral of the story dont make them look like fools when they are wrong just say nothing or state facts otherwise they get angry   the thing is im not a druggie so i never realized this but in retrospect i guess they might have thought it was drugs
  i dont know what you are on about but these arent random checks at your destination by the security/customs personnel there when travelling to the us virtually any passenger has to endure this whole weird interview at the departure airport the most annoying thing about them are these gotcha questions where they rapidly ask you the same questions a few times to make you trip and catch you in a lie
  not sure why he didnt take the us    because the currencies of some countries are socalled closed currencies where its a crime to export them funnily enough importing is also often prohibited he basically left you off the hook by just confiscating it
  no not really unless you are coming in looking like a dude bro backpacker or from some grey area country its generally pretty painless      the most annoying thing about them are these gotcha questions where they rapidly ask you the same questions a few times to make you trip and catch you in a lie    never experienced this though when i travel i am clean shaven nicerish clothing and generally know what my itinerary is also unlike most europeans i look the person asking the questions in the eyes for whatever reason this is uncommon for most scandinavians or germans and they always talk about being harassed by immigration
  are you an american citizen when was the last time youve flown to the us because nowadays this is the standard procedure this happenened to me in frankfurt and amsterdam
  no not really unless you are coming in looking like a dude bro backpacker or from some grey area country its generally pretty painless    what didnt you understand about virtually any passenger these interviews happen regardless of your appearance at schiphol for example they have a special area/gate for these interviews of usbound flights so in the worst case youll have to go to the other end of the airport for your actual flight after the procedure
  i think he meant they wont ask as many questions or loaded questions if youre well dressed    i call bullshit i often travel wearing military boots black metal shirts and have long hair ive never had any problems and im not a us citizen i think it really depends how well you treat the agent/official and if they had sex the last night
  its not that bad anon youre making it sound like they take you to the back room and shine a light in your eyes and question you to death the questions are generally the same all around and fairly basic that you should be able to respond fairly quickly and confidently issues and double asked questions generally come up when you dont sound confident in your answer mumble about or dont give any kind of reasonable sounding overview of what you plan to do    the amount of stupid shit i hear from others when standing in those lines are hilarious  reason for visiting  i uhh want to go to new york and then to texas and california and uhh spend time there  how long for visit  i uhh think maybe 2 weeks or 3  do you have sufficent funds   yes i have uhh like 500 euros    shit like that will get them to dig in deeper to your shit because it sounds iffy and the amount of people who fly in or come in then never level is off the charts the questions that are asked for people coming in is completely reasonable and often takes less than 5 or 10 minutes
   then never leave is off the charts    wow fucked that one up
  ive gotten ssss which was then overridden by tsa pre      not the person who you replied to but there are a airports who use stickers as a good thing    i flew first class and i got a sticker placed on my boarding pass which i transferred to my passport    this sticker will give you access to express lanes for security carry on checks but not for nexus/ge access
worst i ever had was one time flying out of kuwait for the us the guys at gate security were in fullon nutcutting mode went thoroughly through everybodys carry on confiscating shit like spare aabatteries this was back before outlets on the plan were common and knickknacks bought in the shops in the airport and there is nobody more humorless and illnatured than an arabic person who has little authority in his civic life but has a bit while at work    and the one time in cartagena colombia also bound for the us when i arrived at the gate pretty early arrived at airport with some friends who had an earlier flight and the security lady was bored i guess and gave me a random xray i dont mean a scan i mean a medicalgrade look at your skeleton full body xray which was interesting i guess but seemed over the top fortunately i did not have a colon full of drugstuffed condoms which i guess is what she was looking for
thinking of getting a cheaper vehicle and just traveling around the us for however long i enjoy it i have about 8000 saved up and make 3000 take home a month without work my bills might eat up 400 of that a month i have no obligations anywhere to anyone where i am living right now    what vehicle would be ideal i dont want to spend a lot but also dont want to break down once a month     would lodging eat too much into my budget hostels or possibly sleeping in the vehicle     i really have nothing to lose and i am bored out of my mind being stationary and doing fuck all everyday any suggestions on what you would do
  car   get something basic as fuck with cheap parts/service and decent gas mileage but is comfortable for long drives toyota camry chevy malibu etc get it inspected for major problems before you buy it it costs about 100 at most auto shops  sleeping  sleeping in your car is fine once in a while but doing it regularly sucks both mentally and physically hostels are basically nonexistent in the us outside of a few major cities and the state of alaska camping is by far the cheapest lodging option theres about a hojillion acres of usfs/blm land you can camp on for free or you can go to a state park campground or private campground like koa get a throwaway email and sign up for sites like bookingcom and hotelscom theyre always running specials on rooms that are hard for hotels to rent and you can earn points example i was on a road trip around the western states and decided to treat myself to a hotel room in reno after two weeks of camping i got a king suite on the 22nd floor of the nugget hotel in reno but because it faced the train yard it was only 75 and i had 20 worth of points earned up so i got a really nice hotel room for motel 6 money    food  get yourself a cooler and propane camp stove what will really kill your budget is eating out all the time
  for camping out do you recommend just getting a really nice tent and things for it     would a really good sleeping bag be enough to keep warm if it is hot would you just be screwed would just planning my trip around weather/climates be better i guess if it was going to storm i could just get a room for the night     thanks for the advice
  no sweat i love a good meandering road trip its one of my favorite ways to travel i spent nearly three years wandering around in an old chevy lumina working seasonal /out/ jobs and camping for weeks or months between  for car camping you dont need to buy the latest and greatest mountaineering grade gear a tent from target and a tarp for extra weather protection would be sufficient if you were to splurge on anything id say splurge on a good sleeping bag its a good investment  bags are rated to certain temps and if you shop around clearance sites you can get a good 15 down bag for 200ish pair that up with the right sleeping pad and you can stay pretty comfy in chilly weather if its hot just sleep on top of your pad  weatherwise you just need to be looking at forecasts and radar maps and work around the weather sometimes its unavoidable though and all you can do is find a place to hunker down for a night or two
  just hearing you talk about it makes me want to do this even more the idea of roaming around and going where i want sounds really appealing i imagine i could just use my phone as a cheap hots pot for planning out the next stops sounds like a damn good adventure and way to learn a lot i imagine you meet a lot of interesting people as well did you ever have any concerns with safety or did you just plan to not stay in shady areas
  i just stayed out of shady areas a lot of nomad types recommend sleeping in their car/truck in walmart parking lots but fuck that too many sketchy people around as for motels never go with the cheapest place its always a sketchy shit hole trip advisor is a great way to research/recon lodging options and booking sites have review/ratings pick two or three options that are affordable but not suspiciously cheap and then read as many reviews as you can   but really i just spent most of my nights out innawoods real life isnt a horror movie and youre actually way safer camping than you are in most cities just because theres no one else around established campgrounds can be fun though if you get a bit lonely good opportunity to meet other wanderers   oh and get a good up to date road atlas google maps isnt as reliable as it claims
is it really as bad as the jews make it out to be
  no  /thread
its an authoritarian state where the gov owns you so yes íts bad  however it is also a place full of healthy qt314s that wear little makeup and dont get fat   so its both good and bad imo
  authoritarianism is bad
  well yes you think you could shitpost here if you were in nk   hmm ok youve got a point
  do you really want to fund them though
  when are you going maybe well meet
  lol
  get off /trv/ kim
  yes im sure nk will buy a lot of nukes for my 1000 dollars
      thats the usual debate here i can see the point that you dont want to feed the machine but on the other hand there is value to seeing what you can for yourself in the case of nk you are only going to see what they let you see  its a completely programmed visit but still at least you can see that they are doing that    in general if i didnt want to travel to countries with governments i dont like there arent many places i could go staying home is also problematic    but if you can make the case for anybody itd be nk    at the end of the day i guess id go if the opportunity came up but its not something im seeking out  there is a long long list of places id rather go
  does it really matter why do people get so caught up in ethical stuff
you will see it with your own eyes have fun its an awesome trip i loved it
take the train  
if youre american is it okay
  i heard it sucks being stuck with a guide the whole time did u go with a travel company how much did it cost you to go there    no op but been on the fence about this as im not the type who likes to improvise while travelling as opposed to doing somebody elses preconceived itinerary
  dont get fat  well duh they have no food
  is it bad  no but youre basically on a huge train ride of oh look and see shit there are going to be two conflicting opinions here euros who are fine with getting told to sit down shut up and enjoy the ride and everyone else who is wanting to see something not fake    youll have a good time its just shit about oh look here now yes this is real nk haha look our people love yes haha epic       is it worth it     fuck no just go to china
it was pretty nice especially when you are alone with guides an not in a big group    have been there last year
  serious post    if youre a us passport holder do not go the fb/instagram whatever social media pics are not worth the risks of being sent back as a potato     if youre a chinese passport holder by all means go take pics and start a thread when you get back
  you are as a group and with a guide all the time but it doesnt suck at all our guides were awesome i went with koryo just do a group tour you will meet fun people
  americans cant go anymore since trump forbade it
  no but youre basically on a huge train ride of oh look and see shit there are going to be two conflicting opinions here euros who are fine with getting told to sit down shut up and enjoy the ride and everyone else who is wanting to see something not fake  like joining any other tourism group on the world visiting the nicest places
  smart
  nice blog    anon go out there and enjoy it check if there are inlands tours you can attend to enjoy it
  thats pretty much where im sitting i visit dictatorship all the time  hell most people here just fund sea  so why not the question is more like do i see enough cool stuff to make up for the fact/get my money worth
i just dont think its worth the risk personally even though id love to go and see all the crazy monuments and oppressed people i dont want to be lobotomised
  there is no risk at all dprk is about the safest place you can visit as long as you dont do fucking idiotic things
  the only thing that can kill you there is you if you decide to really disrespect the law   after all you are more safer there then in any other city in europe or america
  muh politics  who cares anon aint going there to lease an apartment hes going to see cool shit just as i would if big brother in the socalled land of the free wasnt doing the same thing but pretending its ok so long as the us calls the shots
  interesting thanks    das gesungene lied am ende ist wunderbar
hi op  ive been to north korea it was so interesting and i cant explain it all in a post  just follow the rules and its very safe try to bond with your tour guide a little he/she will be your best shot at getting real insight into the country    my guide was a young guy named mr qua great dude still think about him sometimes hope he gets out of there someday
just go to dandong you can buy all of the dprk paraphernalia you want and eat in the fabled fake food dprk restaurants without the bullshit tour/visa frustration/moral dilemma    pic related was there two weeks ago
  how much
  some people have ethics even on 4channel
  that sort of thing pisses me off the concept of the us government saying i cant go to places they are mad at whether cuba or north korea or anyplace else is infuriating    i dont give a shit which president or congress imposes or renews such bans i do not need the state to decide for me where i should go what is safe what is moral/ethical  i reserve the right to make those decisions myself    now im going to be fuming all day swell
  like joining any other tourism group on the world    anywhere else in the world you could say you know im getting off this ride and striking out on my own since i wont get imprisoned for it or anything
  somebody posted about travel on a forum for posting about travel    shit guys from now on just post pictures of hookers
is it possible to fuck nork qts while over there
  this is against the principles of juche
  no literally impossible the best you can get is a chinese hooker in the massage parlor of yanggakdo hotel
  depends if youre chinese or not
  the difference between traveling to other countries and north korea is that most other countries have some form of an open economy this means that you can contribute to individuals street vendors shop owners tour operators who oftentimes do not pay taxes so your funding of the state through visa payments and other tax payments is outweighed by giving those people in the country some cash    in the case of north korea however 100 of the money you spend on the tour  the money the agency takes will go directly to the government
  that is interesting    nk probably needs some foreign currency for imports i would imagine    it doesnt seem like i see many people on bicycles there are there and i just havent seen the right kind of photos or are there not
  not if youre swedish swedes can walk around the country freely
  yeah americans are the biggest hypocrites when it comes to human rights
  whats so special about sweden what about finns and norwegians

  low testosterone eh
anyone done the ring road trip in iceland going next year renting a car but staying in hotels and airbnbs not much of a camping fan and have done a ton of research into it but looking for more insider tips should i totally skip the golden circle any stand out areas not to miss i was planning on doing a tour of some glaciers and maybe snorkling the silfra rift
  ive done that ring road trip and you choose very good option of renting car not campervan hostels and hotels are not as cheap as living in camper but believe me  youve choose far more better option dont skip golden circle i found this area very nice especially for light and easy trips or just admiring nature you could skip area of vik  there are no important objects there besides ice lake old volcanos near area of myvatn are nice choose one and go there fantasting landsacpes but beware roads on north part of iceland are generally in poorer conditions comparing to southern roads especially in their winter when theres tons of snow everwhere and strong winds i dont do snorkling so idk how it is but visiting glaciers is good plan also visit some waterfalls
    i hitchhiked the ring road when i was 20 golden circle was fun and worthwhile if a bit touristic
  i am doing a trip as well next year in august or september and am wondering if it is worth getting a much more expensive 4x4 instead of a say vw golf not necessarily b/c of road conditions but because you are not allowed to travel the froads without a 4x4    another thing that is bugging me not booking through some tour provider i fear the worst that could happen is the route 1 road closing at some critical point eg i think between höfn and the east there is only 1 road and not being able to travel further at all   i really dont like booking through tours since they limit you in what oyu can do but since its quite expensive of a trip either way i wouldnt want to ruin the trip and at the same time lose the cash if something like that happens    any ideas or recommendations
  id say its worth getting a 4x4 there are tons of dirt roads especially if you want to visit hekla   i booked my var through gold car got a suzuki vitara 4x4 and it was perfect   i went in both march and august of this year everything was open in august the weather was quite mild and did the whole ring road including the west fjords  in march i did the ring road also in a 4x4 with spiked tires because there was still snow and lots of black ice on the roads   didnt book any tours except glacial lagoon sailing and glacier walking  drove to the location on both occasions   youll be fine traveling by your own car in august
monitoring thread because this one of my road trip goals  another is driving across australia
  was it still touristy in august would september be ok for this just tying to avoid crowds and the grade school kids
  you tend to find that the hotspots are rather packed ie the glacial lagoon boat tour and larger waterfalls your busses park there and obviously offload a ton of tourists the good thing about driving yourself is that the roads are pretty empty once you leave reykjavik   but yes there were definitely more tourists in august compared to march   i found march to be more visually appealing due to everything being covered in ice and snow but with a tradeoff that the north is inaccessible
  thanks so much for the response can you comment on what weather/tourist situation would be like in september
    been to iceland many times including the ring road your best bet of avoiding tourists is to go to some of the sites that are directly off the actual ring road so think westfjords areas of northern iceland like husavik or saudokrokur and then areas of eastern iceland anything on the road will have significantly more tourists southern iceland in general seems to have more not really sure why    i would suggest a 4x4 there are some unpaved areas of the ring road in eastern iceland as for weather august should be mild and so will early september but i wouldnt risk later september if you want that summery mild weather i remember going in early june once and it was actually very cold think like march like weather in the eastern us
  i have a friend who went there and decided to save money by renting a golf and had no problem going on the dirt roads rentals can go anywhere you want as long as you dont break something very obvious or critical
  id imagine it would be nearing the onset of winter late september but that may work in your favor if youre chasing northern lights   north part will be cold and windy but south part will be similar to that of new york   as for tourists its hard to say therell always be tourists there but i definitely found there to be more tourists in august compared to when i was there in march so id probably expect a few
  would it be ok to go with my wife and 10 year old daughter or is it too rugged we would be staying in hotels thanks for the great responses i appreciate this board better than others because in other places im usually told to fuck off or called a faggot
  you should definitely get a 4x4 you should be fine in august but if you decide to travel in september you might get hit by snow     additionally froads are so much fun its worth the money to experience offroading in those amazing landscapes
  if youll be staying in hotels its really not that rugged of a country to travel through general roads are well maintained and as long as you know where youre going theres not much that could go wrong
  do car rental agencies look at small scratches on 4x4s i mean it would be almost impossible to not have scratches or a bit of damage on the car after going through the froads
  yeah definitely bring them its such an amazing place  i fell in love with iceland immediately its the best of both worlds infrastructure in reykjavik is great the ring road is mostly maintained but as the other anon mentioned the f roads can be rugged where a 4x4 will make your life easier and put a smile on your face   and youre welcome      fully agree with you      they say they will and do an inspection before and after the rental im not sure if its a scare tactic but i fell for it so i bought extra fully comprehensive insurance for an extra  100usd for 5 days where all they dont cover is your doors getting blown out by wind scratches rock chips and cracked windshields are all covered under this plus a replacement car anywhere on the island if anything were to happen
    thanks for the tips ill probably book through a local company that has all inclusive coverage and only gives you a voucher for the actual car company when you arrive always had worked well in the past still feels an impossibility to not get scratches into the car when driving on roads like     a relative of mine went in september this year and there were still a lot a lot of tourists i wonder how bad it is in august july etc
when is the best time to go if i specifically just want to see the aurora borealis
  id get insurance for a chipped/cracked windshield i wouldnt worry about chips in the paint its a 4x4 after all just return it dirty so they wont be able to tell       a relative of mine went in september this year and there were still a lot a lot of tourists i wonder how bad it is in august july etc  its definitely going to be busy its generally a matter of going a bit out of the way away from the ring road we drove way into the westfjords and didnt see a soul for three days       post september
  i would guess end of september  march      how many tourists are around the froads i know there are tours going there as well and people probably rent 4x4s to drive them but would think not as many as on the ring road    what are some of the must see/do things in the highlands  i have on my list/map  nýifoss  landmannalaugar  mælifell  ófærufoss  lake askja  hekla    to be honest i havent check if these are accessible by road or if you have to hike a fair amount if you know can you give input    picture related marking some stuff on mymaps for the trip next year
1541 eur  1369 gbp  1761 usd  is that an ok price for a 4x4 dacia duster for 2 weeks with all the possible insurances included theres always a selfrisk amount which bothers me but booking through the service i used previously which offers full coverage no self risk costs 34 thousand 
im looking at going in early october most travel sites are littered with retard tourists that insist youd have to have a death wish to drive rt 1 in any season thats not summer sounds more like theres a lot of idiots who just drive too fast and dont pay attention since millions of people visit at all times of the year and they dont all just magically drive off a cliff when it rains or snows a bit
whats worth doing for someone wholl be spending 3 days in reykjavik in december ill be there 1720 dec
  1 day reyk 2 days going on some tours you can go to some of the major sights that are close by not sure if you could also get to the west fjords but theyre good too
  its been about 5 years since my trip there but i was there first week of september when i went and the weather was glorious cool but not cold however extremely windy and the roads and hotels were half empty i didnt have rain but good northern lights each night i understand its much busier nowadays in the shoulder seasons but the weather may not be as predictable each day    yes on getting full insurance and low deductible every repair and part costs more in iceland and most of the cars are retrofitted and therefore more expensive than your average 2018 rental car think 50 more plan for rocks to hit your windshield and ding your undercarriage no you probably dont need 4x4 without mud or serious snow ring road is nicely paved most of your sept plans wont have bad weather the rocky roads you might be offroading on simple driveways to peoples homes or hotels which should be graded and nicely maintained    you need 10 days to circle the island otherwise you do reykjavik golden circle blue lagoon and pick either going north to snaefellsnes west fjords and all the things betweenoryou go south with a shorter trip youll have backtracking to get back to reykjavik    fun activity in the fall is the roundup where the roamin wild icelandic sheep are brought down from the hills and gathered up to shear and store for the winter its like a scene from town  country magazine with the english riding outfits on the iceland horses miles of land rovers and horse carriers mixed with cattle drives of the old west
  thanks for the great information
  dont skip the golden circle its really cool and i really liked geisir     id definitely say renting a car is the way to go we got a bullshit small suzuki swift and it was fine for all of the ring road remember that gas is fucking expensive there so getting something small will save a lot of money     definitely book your lodging way in advance if youre going any time between april and september because the cheaper options will book full really early
1 on getting full coverage or some kind of excess insurance    i was fine but ive heard numerous people getting multiple punctures because the rocks are so sharp and can get spread onto the road     definitely try to avoid even small rocks on the road
  oh boy thats what i fear most the rental car breaking down while travelling to the next hostel worst case breaking down while on the froads
are there statistics which months are the most touristy
  iceland receives the highest number of tourists during summer juneaugust in 2014 around 42 of visitors arrived in iceland during its summer months proportionally a slight decrease compared to the previous two years the percentage of winter visitors having increased by over 4 in the same period 
  just found their statistics release  seems like even though may has most of the sun / least clouds its also the least touristy month i find that weird
  i would guess most schools dont finish until end of mayjune
  faggot
    also no northern lights theyre mostly visible sepmarch
  i am looking into booking a pre planned tour but not sure which provider to go with anyone has experience with the local tours/companies on iceland looking to do a multi day /week tour trekking through the highlands  since i am too lazy to plan this out myself and would go alone i think its fine to book through a company small group if possible
  now thats epic
  lolol
tourists fuck off you are not welcome
  well all leave so you can go back to herding sheep for a living idiot
  youll go back to being sheep herders if we stop visiting icebro
do i need a 4x4 bros going in january and wanna chase the lights    also i know blue lagoon is a meme but is it still worth    thnx brehs
    new is good because its new  old is bad because its old  well stop being inundated by foreign expectations as to what we should be doing with our lives  well stop being sieged by hordes of polluting hooting bothersome tourists who think this should become their country and will mercilessly hang out anyone who doesnt worship tourists in perfect english on fucking yelp  well have an opportunity to be proud of our national culture and history instead of being torn apart by foreign politicians who shouldnt even be informed in the slightest about what happens in our country  our next generation of children will be raised able to wipe their own asses and maintain their own society happier than our wasted generation because theyre able to solve their own problems in their own ways  and those of us whore unsatisfied with what our families what our people want can fuck right off to another country and be driven mad by the screaming and beeping of social media and toothless leftie activism that abandons the nations of the world to neglect so that people can be miserable and lonely in each their own ivory tower pursuing innovation and individuality thats nothing more than senseless iconoclasm and navelgazing egoism that turns what could have been a proud functional country into a smoking wreckage  wed have the right to punish our criminals throw out moneygrabbing conglomerates and work together so we can all be happy together without guilt or shame  our grandparents did it  if we cant where is humanity going  this understimulated overentitled society is only going grey from stress its creating for itself by taking the right to have a nation the right to work and the right to cooperate out of peoples hands turning them into nice little consumers who dissect and sacrifice the society their parents and grandparents loved because it gives them three extra likes on facebook    sounds like a nice fucking deal sign me up
  yes no plenty of better aka non commercial hot springs all over the country
  as you pointed out yourself these are all effects of globalism and consumerism i think its also pretty fair to say most of its effects are irreversible the genie is out of the bottle fighting these effects on a nostalgia and muh culture basis is futile just have a look at westerneurope    fact is youre a country with a population so small that its negligible on a global scale whos historical value has been its geographical location and now has little more to offer than untainted and stunning nature having a rapidly increasing number of yearly tourists is something to act upon with pragmatic regulation not nationalism
would 4 days be enough to see some of the scenery of iceland    if so what are the main suggestions i dont want to stay too long because after a while scenery eventually all looks the same and you get fatigued
  would 4 days be enough to see some of the scenery of iceland  no you can do golden circle in a day or two if you take your time but after that youd have to pick a few things to see
  ive been suggested the horse riding thing
  yeah thats pretty fun can really recommend participating in the sheep gatherings but that requires you to travel there during a very specific time in september
whats it like in the winter thinking of going just to see the northern lights and renting a cosy cabin with some friends i imagine quite a bit of ring road will be closed off but whats the best way to go about this plan    we just had this idea that instead of going somewhere crowded and lining up we want to just be somewhere quiet and see some beautiful shit
what do you think gents do you think they found her or is this just more misinformation being spread by the media as click bate    
a little background info american lady went vacationing in costa rica with her sisterinlaw dropped off her sisterinlaw at the airport went back into the city to do some sightseeing and was never seen again family calls the embassy because she never boarded her flight home cr government did nothing about it a few days later a body is found in plastic bags is it just me or is there something seriously wrong with this picture
  elaborate on your opinions
  go out to do something solo in a country you arent accustom to  be a woman who is decent looking  bad things happen    wowie never knew
  also  in her last message she told a friend the power was going out adding the area was pretty sketchy or unsafe  i cant believe someone who went into a shady area to totally probably not buy drugs or anything had some bad stuff happen
im just saying the power goes out local government couldnt care less yet still has the wherewithal to investigate into the case to learn from an unnamed source that she seemed to be a normal state of mind plus explain the 5am uber ride also why would her family believe her to be in imminent danger
be in a sketchy area as a single girl  first mistake  booking an airbnb in a sketch place  second mistake  power goes out and not locking your door staying fucking put till power comes back  third mistake
another strong empowered woman falls victim to reality    bet shes the type of roastie whore who advocates for mass immigration and feminism
la creatura
dude of all places i thought 4chan would get that this whole situation seems far from what it appears to be its just too convenient
  the article leaves out way too much and appears to be rushed for a story headline    the airbnb rental owner and local security guards said they saw her get into an unknown car with her luggage at around 0500 local time according to the family  okay  officials were not pursuing the matter because ms stefaniak had appeared rational at the time of her disappearance and got into a taxi of her own free will  uber or taxi if uber probably pretty damn easy to track down the driver fairly quickly if taxi should be a bit harder but should be doable as well
  so what happened then poirot wow us with your amazing detective skills
   also why would her family believe her to be in imminent danger  because she was traveling alone reported that she felt unsafe in her situation didnt show up for her flight out and no one could get in contact with her retardo all of those things point to this person is probably in trouble
  since when is getting kidnapped and murdered convenient please list some real world examples
getting into a taxi at 5am indicates she likely wasnt out trying to score drugs as a previous poster indicated how can she call for an uber/taxi if her phone would have likely died given the fact that the power was out all night if its a landline that points to her likely calling a taxi from the airbnb
my argument here is that it is all a coverup thats what i mean by it being too convenient
  you dont have an argument at all youre just making vague statements and not backing them up with anything
so were just going to let this case just fall through the cracks then let it be known that the 4chan community is just going to chalk this up to believing whats spoonfed to them by the mediapathetic
  this is some fascinating bait i must admit
not your personal army faggot
  to think costa rica is supposed tobe the safest country in central america
  that doesnt mean its impossible to get murdered there denmark is the safest country in europe and people still get murdered there
  a travel board on a site for anime titty posting should care what one person thinks about the entire collective of users on the site because one thousandth of them wont pander to his faggot detective bullshit go back to your travel sub faggot
any suggestions on where to spend christmas in europe  so far im flying into london in early december and have about 25 weeks to kill before heading to edinburgh for hogmanay  i had strasbourg suggested to me but its completely booked out in hostelworld so i guess that rules it out
  bavarian towns are gorgeous during christmastime   pic related landshut  budapest also has some great christmas markets lot of ice rinks and fairly cheap prices compared to western europe
  bratislava bratu
  strasbourg/colmar is nice and romantic but yeah its quite touristy
  rottenburg has probably the best christmas store/museum in the world but its packed at that time of year
is nuremberg good
  edinburgh for hogmanay    i live here trust me on this and spend it in glasgow instead
thinking about budapest myself are the christmas markets good any good ideas for a daytrip bratislava maybe
  ive spent a couple of christmas in budapest yes the markets are really pretty and less crowded than the ones in germany too ive done christmas in köln too budapest is a lot cheaper to eat and drink than germany and the woman are much hotter tho i never had any luck but still nice to look at
  tfw already booked a tour  i guess glasgow is worth a visit after
  check out szentendre its like 30 minutes from budapest but theres a world of difference between the two places its comfy as fuck during the winter  too
  im from nuremberg and the christmas market is nice you can also take the train to bamberg bayreuth rothenburg and so on which have quite cute markets as well
  i was thinking of going to stuttgart because a friend lives there but those places seem nice as well i dont have to book the tickets right ill just go to the train station and buy them from there also are the prices expensive thanks in advance
  thanks i marked it down any other places worth to go esztergom hopefully there will be some snow
  zermatt
  the castle and the church are really nice i dont know about the christmas markets tho  eger is also a cute and historic town pécs too although its further from budapest than vienna
  25 weeks  hungary poland czech republic
keep in mind in germany they will beat you to death
  definitely recommending both budapest and its christmas market where i was earlier today and szentendre too hungary does winter well all those hot pools to swim in help as does the unicum palanka etc
op here ive decided something along the lines of budapest/prague/nuremberg/munich  still debating on which city to spend christmas day in either budapest or munich does it matter any thoughts
  spend it wherever it snows on christmas day
  szeged is delightful between two and three hours from budapest by train easily my favourite provincial hungarian town of those i know and do go to the baths in budapest szchenyi or rudas or gellert are the best options each of them completely different in feel
  budapest  does it matter  you wanna spend xmas out and about or locked inside the hotel praying you dont get aloha snackbared thats essentially your choice
  why do you say this im visiting from australia that time of year and thought it looked really fun still have time to go to glasgow instead
  wait are you saying you will get aloha snackbared in budapest stupid american sure budapest is orders of magnitude less safe than munich but your main concern will be the high likelihood of being robbed by gypsies or by homeless locals its not like your life will be in danger if you are on a budget you could still brave it because munich is also very expensive while budapest is pretty cheap
  sure budapest is orders of magnitude less safe than munich   the other way around retard
      if you are going to be a retard dont do it in a public post that shows everyone just how dumb you are
im in strasbourg at the moment christmas markets are pretty comfy but since there are so many stalls all spread throughout the city it gets really repetitive and everything closes at 1950hr sharp also really expensive could use it as a base to visit towns in the area for more smaller cosy markets     ive also been to dresden and they were great munich were average berlin are really nice vienna is also huge
  those numbers for munich are heavily doctored by the german police who are doing everything they can to sweep the growing problem of nonwhite crime under the carpet
  heavily doctored by the german police  proof needed
  i dont like those official statistics so they must be false  butthurt hungarian detected
    must feel great being successfully brainwashed by the jews
  are you going to post proofs or not
what is life really like in russia
bumping    im planning a relatively large trip to russia next summer 3 months mostly to get better at russian while visiting but am still thinking about where i should go also thinking about whether i should travel by train/bus or renting/buying a motorcycle    things im interested in mostly is anything historic architecture museums etc     cities i would love seeing are moscow sebastopol volgograd sotchi and saint pete apparently kazan is really amazing too    other than that i tought about going to kazakhstan and see the aral sea ship graveyard black sea and the whole southern russia interests me but if anyone has advices please tell me    pic rel was my first idea but apparently that whole western kazakhstan part is a shitty idea since it is extremely boring and a bit dangerous
  it gets shittier every year and people are too devoid to care    our government is trying to turn the country into the next china or at least back into the sssr    we might not be able to access sites like 4chan and google in about a year because they dont follow our civil laws in fact i might just get killed for making this post and i cant even use tor to reply and having a vpn could get me 5 years in the gulag for disturbing the peace    the people are bigger morons than i ever though americans are    what they lack in hollow brains they make up for in hostility    i saw a drunk asshead last month who screamed his lungs out during the night in gibberish while everyone was watching and when somebody tried interfering he threw a glass bottle in his face and he ran while he kept screaming mother this mother that the police never came because nobody called due to lack of trust in the civil authority    i lost 3 former classmates to that krokodil poison all because they never graduated grade school i never really cared for them because they beat up everybody    and dont get me started on the older people at least the one im surrounded by  if you thought american conservatives were aggressive these people will bombard you with putin is god    in fact im moving soon    im planning on leaving to belarus before they start a war with them and install some kind of citizen point ranking system like in china the kind which restricts your right to live if youre all play and no work    youre lucky if you live literally anywhere else op appreciate it
  aral sea ship graveyard  no longer a thing the chinese took the ships away for scrap material unironically
  aral sea ship graveyard  in the last two years most of the ships have been almost completely dismantled for scrap metal
  oh did not read that identical answer above before posting
  and dont get me started on the older people  sovoks will be all dead in 10 years then just like us with boomers youll inherit decrepit commieblocks and stop baba from hoarding every plastic container she can find
  lol im pretty sure this is bait mostly because of the krokodil and moving to belarus part maybe youre poor or are hanging around poor people i lived in a provincial city in russia for a year about 5 years ago and if youre middle to upper middle class its mostly fine though obviously shitty compared to western europe the parts about crazy aggressive drunks and staunchly conservative old people are true tho
  lol im pretty sure this is bait mostly because of the krokodil and moving to belarus part  well its probably bait but you will be surprised how much truth is in this bait
  yeah sure lets just pretend that its normal to know 3 people who died from krokodil
  
  why belarus sorry for asking about that but i always thought russia is more stable than belarus
  how normal is it for an american in the midwest to know at least 3 people who died from meth/heroin/being a general junkie its the same thing
  i mean i know zero people who have overdosed on anything illegal but whatevs personally i would like to thank china for churning out lots of cheap fentanyl and mailing it to anyone in the us who asks for it its clearing the streets of undesirables now if we could just get a ban on the administration of narcan to anyone who voluntarily administered the opioids to themselves as opposed to the paramedic accidentally got some of that shit on him while trying to treat the junkie we could really make some progress
  its the opposite    in fact they are planning on cutting ties with us      as a matter of fact im in the lower class drug
  now if we could just get a ban on the administration of narcan to anyone who voluntarily administered the opioids to themselves as opposed to the paramedic accidentally got some of that shit on him while trying to treat the junkie we could really make some progress  v edgy  fentanyls causing the spike in fatalities but oxycontin and purdue pharmaceutical lying about its addictiveness was the main reason behind the massive spike in opiod use recently the biggest growth in heroin users were boomers who were put on oxycontin with a relative opioid strength of 150 compared to morphine for back pain lost their prescription when states started restricting it and subsequently ended up on street heroin the sacklers owners of purdue all live in london and donate a tonne to british cultural institutes to try and get knighthoods and shelter themselves from us class action lawsuits
how much for 1 week in a hotel air tickets are expensive desu im sucha poor fuck cant even afford fucking russia
  i dont know but you have to be very lowclass to know 3 people who died from any drug in russia      ok so that explains it life sucks if youre lower class anywhere maybe with the excerption of some western european countries
  kazakhstan is very naaaaise all other countries are little children
  low wage in west means wageslavecucking for bills
greetings /trv/    my gf and i will go to cancun next may for staying 6 nights aside swimming with dolphins in isla mujeres going to chichen itzá and tulum we have no idea about what to do she enjoys beaches and im a historical guy we are on budget and we wont intend to go to nightclubs i have some doubts   is it worth to know valladolid in the chichen itzá daytrip or not   xcaret blinks tourist trap am i right
  there are better nearby ruin sites then chichen itza anon those are the ones you should check out  id skip the isle of women
  no real reason to go to isla mujeres unless youre staying somewhere cheap on the locals side    just head straight to tulum and stay there there are nearby ruins not up to itza but a fraction the tourists
  how to get to tulum from cancun shall i rent a motodirtbike    you can take a waverunner to isla mujeres but there can be rental scams
  xcaret was really fun though it is expensive  you would need to go there for two days  i loved tulum but couldnt skip the isla mujeres part
  no reason for dirt bike its flat and boring all around just take a bus
  xelha was cool too my brother and i did acid there and it was a blast      skip chicen itza op its far and boring
  ado buses are nice ive only ever rented vehicles on cozumel i personally wouldnt rent one on the mainland but thats just me
what is it like to take the crazy viking ferry from stockholm to helsinki    all i hear is that it is a crazy party boat so im curious if anyone on /trv/ has been on it and could give their experience
  its not a crazy party boat more like a boat filled with families and shit
  cruises in generally are really party central thats the image marketing promotes and draws them as while i dont know about that liner specifically many crazy cruise stories are heavily overblown
  were the hip young cruise line with the best parties    every cruise line ever    t crew
alright /trv/ im intrested in doing an ayahuasca retreat   does anyone know of any good and legit locations
      i went here for 1 week cant recommend it enough
  cant recommend it enough  tell us more about your experience  t belasarius
  well without going further into it and making a whole thread out of the entire experience    all i can say is that my experience at this specific ayahuasca retreat changed me forever    in terms of the things i sawi met egyptian gods rowing me on a boat in hyperspace surrounded by snakes and little green elves who were dancing only afterwards did i find out that this boat in terms of shape and structure was the same boat that individuals take on their way to the afterlife according to egyptian mythology keep in mind i had never studied any of this stuff before and it was all completely new to me    i was addicted to using adderall since i was 12 and antidepressants since i was 17after the experience i completely stopped taking both and found more direction in my own life    i still see don luco the shaman in my dreams maybe 24x a month     what i would say is that ayahuasca is not a fun thing to do it really isnt something to be taken lightly its a medicine that can help the right people with the openness to allow for the experience
  tell us more please
  anything specific you want to know
  i took ayahuasca by myself i literally woke up smeared in my own shit it was smeared all over the walls ground into the shag carpet and rubbed all over me my mouth my face my hair chest dude eveywhere i wonder if i emptied a dog bin out for it it was freezing cold when i came to my wife left me afterwards why do a drug that you cant control yourself on
  well in this case there are shamans so to speak who guide you and stuff at least thats what thsi guy is saying i would never do it by myself knowing me lol
  ayahuasca is the last drug id ever want to take alone if this is not bait youre absolutely retarded and deserved for that to happen    taking aya is all about the set and setting the songs the shaman sings ease the tensions and help guide you through the visuals and experience as a whole the shamans are also well aware of the potential for freakouts like that to happen and they know how to deal with such cases    when i did it this girl began screaming and moving uncontrollably since she was reliving her childhood sexual abuse the shaman and his apprentice calmed her down by laying her on the mat putting a cold rag on her head blowing mapacho onto her and singing a song just for her ive never seen someone do such a 180 on drugs as fast as that in a matter of a minute she was laughing a crying tears of clear happiness
  i was trying my hand at literal shit posting
  you wanted a life chaning experience no
take ayahuasca with shaman  end up getting fingerbanged by some latinx rando  why do white people do this
no man like you need a shaman or else it isnt authentic and youre being a cultural appropriator
ayahuasca is overrated you can get the same benefits of a high dosage of psilocybin
  absolutely not    ive done considerably large doses of shrooms and never was the experience even close to being as overwhelmingly in your face as ayahuasca     mystical experience aside ayahuasca is much more of trip the sounds of the icaros really sets a completely different mood and guide you on your journey    that being said i still love psilocybin and would do it more often since i dont have to travel to a different country    i will say though smoking dmt is even wilder the visuals come at you so quickly its difficult to focus
    yeah did you guys talk about how she was reliving her abuse
  prior to every ceremony we met as a group and discussed about our individuals goals for that specific ceremony we had a small group of just 4 ppl  shaman in total it was the 2nd ceremony and she told us all before hand that she wanted to get over those traumatic memories after the trip had ended for all of us we laid on our mats in the candlelit maloca and discussed the things we saw or experienced
  did it work out for her
  sounds like a great time hearing about some strangers sexual trauma
    well i didnt go into the ayahuasca experience as a recreational person i knew i had things to work out in my personal life primarily my addiction to drugs    while of course it isnt fun learning about the sexual trauma of others it brings everyone together in a sort of beautiful way we were all broken individuals before the experience in our own ways    i still stay in touch with all other 3 ppl i had the ceremonies with they all seem to be doing very well for themselves and we often reminisce about the experience especially the embarrassing moments    for me it is interesting that such 4 strangers can have life altering experiences thanks to this decades old medicine inside a hut in the middle of the amazon forest 5h boat ride from the closest point of real civilization the isolation is a thing that personally affected me a lot it was the first time in my whole life postinternet when i was fully isolated from all forms of social media internet or even tv entertainment for 2 weeks
      same guy here    this icaro sounds eerily similar to the one the shaman sang the moment when my metaphysical body escaped the mat of the maloca and floated above my own head and eventually evaporated this was the soundtrack to death of my own ego    i often hum the melody and words of this song when ever im feeling overwhelmed by life every time this happens my shaman visits me in my dreams and relays is best wishes upon me    i hate writing all this shit out because to be honest with all you i was strongly agnostic to all forms of spirituality prior to ayahuasca after my experience with it ive realized theres much more to our human plain of existence than what meets the naked eye
  i dont see anyone saying that  its more like its preferable to have a professional who has some experience managing things
    how much does an ayahuasca retreat cost anon    how hard is it to get to iquitos for a gringo
brazilian here    my cousin is training to be a guide and does ayhuasca 34 times a month     my parents tried it once but they never did it again ever since
  does he seem serious about it or is he the kind to rip tourists off
  im wondering if this can really cure depression etc or if its just a nonnormie high for hippies
  i paid 400usd for a 5 day stay with 3 ceremonies all food and accommodations were provided on site    iquitos is about 150250 place ticket from lima no big deal    most aya retreats however are a boat ride away from iquitos itself my retreat was a 14h boat ride if you take the 5 collectivo ship or 30 if you take the 3h rapid service     i took the collectivo ship on my way there and my man was that an experience on itself it was like something out of heart of the darkness i was the only gringo on the ship too and was quite welcomed by the locals there we played cards smoked cigs and drank booze overall i would recommend both depending on what kind of experience youre looking for
  pscyhedelics dont cure anything especially the neurochemical imbalances which may make you more susceptible to depressive states    however they do allow you to tackle the root issues underlying your depression and offer you new insights
sup /trv/    i used to be a /b/tard so i come here for some advice  i recently got a job in czceh republic im from a country in south america    i was there for 2 weeks and basically run away    i was expecting that prague was bigger or people nicer    is it jut me am i crazy
  yes its just you because i was for 3 months in brno and five days in prague and everybody was nice to me but im not filthy monkeychino lmao
holy fuck thats precious lol you probably are a candy ass nigger    buti kinda got why its weird to me you all northerners seem to be anti social assholes
i just lived the for a year and enjoyed my time there i knew what to expect though because id stayed there several times before
hey /trv/    ill be in munich for work in february been before last year i noticed that most of the flights connect through london i asked my boss and hes letting me take a 3 night layover there after im done in munich as ive never been to london before    i know its not a ton of time but i was wondering if you had any tips for maximizing my stay there i dont care about meme attractions im more interested in seeing the city as is where would be a good area to stay for walkability looking to spend about 500 usd on hotel
bump because ill be in a similar position as op in march
city has everything humanity has ever achieved and created  what do i see that no one else goes to see  idk if you want anti tourism just watch people go to work or something kek
  what i mean is i like walking the city and seeing all the things that make it the way it is i couldnt care less about the london eye but im very interested in trafalgar square
ill be moving from the usa to busan south korea in january to begin teaching english as a foreign language at a south korean private school i am wondering what the cultural differences i should be aware of in this country are     is there anything that is viewed as offensive or rude in the country that is normal in america     just in general how should i behave differently when i am in sk compared to the usa for example i know in some asian countries it is customary to take off your shoes before entering someones home
  is there anything that is viewed as offensive or rude in the country that is normal in america    these might not be all specific to korea but a good amount of asians countries and asians will do this    keep your damn voice down indoor voices even outdoors  expect a huge increase of smokers and no one is going to ask if its okay to smoke next to you  if get asked out for a beer go and fucking do it this is a social exchange more than anything  korean min will spit everywhere think nothing of it  expect to see people sleeping dont bother them ever  often shops will have a 2 person rule  say thank you but dont expect a welcome dont tip at places keep your area as clean as possible  asians dont smell the same when they sweat make sure you locate good deodorant   chinese mostly have a self above all even their wife kids to some extent this bleeds over a bit  dont talk about the us military or exercises same with north korea or some things about japan  old people will probably hate you  most everyone will be smile and happy to you dont assume this means they like you  speak to whatever language you know best dont attempt to mix in local language with english  google doesnt work the same in korea like it does in the us this is apparent in maps  porn is treated a shit load different  women are treated like ass  learn where to stand for the train let elders sit    is there anything that is viewed as offensive or rude in the country that is normal in america   quite a bunch but most people will probably see you as just another tourist until they start picking up on it
  thank you for the advice i plan on joining a few of the groups for the other tefl teachers in korea to socialize i only see myself having a problem with the voice volume when im drunk so hopefully i will be able to get that under control    do you mind elaborating on the 2 person rule in shops im guessing you just have to go in with a buddy but what is the purpose of this
  do you mind elaborating on the 2 person rule in shops    its not super big anymore but there are quite a few bars food places or what not that will want 2 people minimum there are a slew of reasons such as meals are bigger portions than most koreans will eat in one sitting and wasting food is no they want to attract groups due to limited staff easier to serve 4 groups and rotate through than 16 individual people eating out seen more as a social thing so why would 1 person go out to eat kitchen staff is limited so outside cooking meals that are to be shared its to hard and so on so forth if its not busy and your obviously foreign generally they will not give a shit but keep in mind there is the real chance to be turned away if going in solo most ramen/noodle shops are chill with seating 1 also many more shops are getting machines to punch in the order so might come off a bit weird at first
  taking your shoes off is customary in every first world country
  thank you i wasnt sure if you meant all shops or just like restaurants and bars and shit i was worried that i wasnt gonna be able to go into the grocery store and pick up some food lol
  nah you can still walk into a kfc/burger joint/fast food place go sit down at a bar or noodle shop and be fine just expect some shops to say no sorry due to needing 2 people also expect weird hours on shops and things to close early seeing shit like 11230 58pm is fairly common and things tend to close a bit early depending on your location compared to the us its not like most places in the us where a walmart target or safeway is open till midnight
  how late are the clubs usually open i do a bit of clubbing in the us and ive heard that busan has a nice nightlife
  clubs and bars can go as late as 2am to 5am depends on the club last call really isnt a think for most any asian country
  i like that thank you
everywhere you go and everyone you have a serious conversation with will at some point bitch about japan just nod and let them ramble they grossly exaggerate shit and oftentimes outright lie some people will go fucking ape shit if you ever say youve taken a trip to japan or you say the smallest positive thing about it koreans get angry about the most trivial shit and its beyond even chink levels so basically just avoid political topics agree with whatever they say and try to change the subject when it comes up japan is the most sensitive topic and it will come up and come up often so just be prepared     also korean women are fucking insane theyll lie about shit you do and gas light you its part of the culture fuck them and dip
  noted rip on japan all the time
  youll bond with people doing this no joke
  just tell everyone you meet that dokdo is korean and watch the free drinks pour in
  can i ask why you decided to teach english in korea
  clubs and bars can go as late as 2am to 5am    have you even been clubbing in korea 2 am is when the club starts getting busy and its not uncommon for koreans to go clubbing until 10 in the morning
  if you really want to have fun insist that theres no dokdo its called takeshima
  no extra rules to follow korea is very chill just dont think about doing drugs
  i studied environmental science in college i like this field but i know what types of jobs i can get with this degree and im not really interested in any of them my goal is to gain some experience teaching english in korea for a few years then hopefully ill be able to move on to a cushier job either in korea or in a tier 1 city in china like shanghai     i believe if i do this for 45 and stick between korea and china where the wages are higher i can save enough to go back to school and get my masters in education so i can teach at a decent university in korea    overall almost all the experiences ive read about this opportunity have been positive i am a bit of a social butterfly so as long as i have some opportunities to meet other foreigners in busan this should be a good adventure
  yea i think this will be the hardest part i smoked a lot of weed and took a wide variety of psychedelics when i was in college but ive quit the drugs so i can do this at least alcoholism is widely accepted in korean culture from what ive read anyway
no matter how good you dress at home or how wellcoiffed your hair is be prepared to dress better and take more care of your hair and skin
  what should i be expecting in terms of this i already take time in styling and washing my hair each day and i dont have acne or any other blemishes on my skin besides my freckles and a bad cigarette burn on my wrist that i cover with a watch    i generally dress fairly preppy pic related is this good or should i invest in different wardrobe options
  in this case just go there watch and learn and be prepared to up your styling game  you sound like youre doing a better job than most of the foreigners
  but why do you wanna live/work in east asia
  have an adventure meet other foreigners have new experiences ive read a lot about this being a really life changing experience and im a pretty social guy so i figure ill make friends pretty quick and start having fun     i plan on teaching in korea for a couple years and then hopefully finding a job in a tier 1 city in china that will pay me more depending on my options and how much money i have saved after that ill probably come back to america and get a masters in education and then go teach at a university in one of those countries
  south korean living in the east coast of burgerland moved back and forth quite a bit  ama
  what can i expect in terms of a social life what should i use to meet other people when i first get there
  do you want to date koreans or foreigners
  i have no preference i guess i want a little of both lol
  this is where the fun begins
im planning to travel to amsterdam to try the special mushroom hoping that they will help me get rid of my ten year old depression  is it worth it
worth a shot anon you have little to lose
  dont expect it to be fun but you will definitely have a learning experience
  i dont really care for the trippy visions and newage bullshit but the medical studies ive read seem to be credible enough and temporary fear or suffering seem to be a good enough trade for the possibility of freeing myself from my apathetic state  im only afraid that it will all be an illusion and disappointment
  i had them and they werent really that mindaltering just really funny however i am depressed that i had to come back to the shithole that is the uk and not live in amsterdam
  tbf though now that i think of it i have been pretty motivated to do nofap now im back and want to do an online course and am learning a language might be more to do with losing my virginity there
  did you take a large dose
  10g but it was the one below the most powerful even beside the mushrooms though id highly recommend amsterdam for a good time
    absolutely do it anon i had a bad trip and it scared the shit out of me it was the scariest moment in my entire life    however i would do it again in a heartbeat since it cured my depression which i didnt even was aware i had its the greatest gift in life i was given by myself    just do it
      dont go into it lightly its good to have a goal like you have but dont expect it to be anything other than a heroic journey full of terror and hardship to overcome
itt fucking idiots    dont do mushrooms to cure your fucking depression
    hay guys lets rape a virgin i heard it cures your aids
why go to amsterdam for that
just go on dream market
  just buy some 4aco on the grey market
  id like to join you if you find any good places to take them where you can have a safe and pleasant trip please post    literally the only thing thats stopped me is that ive never taken hallucinogenic drugs and i dont want to do it in the middle of a city as dangerous as amsterdam ive visited the city and was constantly hassled by pickpockets and beggars and druggies
    its not idiotic theres plenty of real research lately showing that it somehow resets the brain needs to be repeated about every three to six months      some of us live in places that have the death penalty for illegal drugs
  i dont want to do it in the middle of a city as dangerous as amsterdam  was constantly hassled by pickpockets and beggars and druggies    ive lived in amsterdam for 25 years now ive never even witnessed a single crime irl let alone be a victim
  must have been a bad trip for   ive been here only a couple of years but cant relate to feeling threatened
  amsterdam  dangerous    if youre going to be the obvious tourist tripping balls in the city center of course youre going to be hassled and pickpocketed     smartshops will give you a plethora of information regarding shrooms before you purchase just find a friend or two trip with and do something lowkey take a walk enjoy a museum sit in one of amsterdams many parks     source  lived there for a year in my early 20s and maybe did shrooms around 45 times no bad trips on my part
just order spores and grow them yourself easy if youre not a retarded nigger
  implying spore buyers arent immediately put on a watchlist
  try lsd for the same reasons similar sorts of evidence for positive effects there
personal anecdote from someone with diagnosed gad and was in a dark place father just passed on taking mushrooms     mushrooms dont give you what you want they give you what you need     being stuck in a rut of depression can be hard to maneuver out of mushrooms will allow you to feel a range of emotions that you had never felt or havent felt for a long time some good a sense of wonder newfound perspectives euphoria and some bad anxiety impending doom and hopelessness its the act of being moved through a gamut of emotions that allows you afterwards to shake off the depression and move forward again     again just my experience
  yep ive had a similar experience and everyone i know that did something similar had their lives change for the better its not some profound understanding of life or something its just an internal dialogue with yourself and your subconscious    afterwards you will have this feeling that youve been silly for the last couple of years and need to move on the trip itself can be very nasty and scary but its worth the transition
  well spoken it will be a very heavy emotional experience but it can be very relieving afterwards  t someone who took shrooms a few times
    that means no he took a very small dosage im sure hes talking about wet mushrooms which would be the equivalent of taking one gram of not very strong shrooms if he had 10 grams of dried shrooms hed have to have puffed out on them and hed have been high as a fucking kite
ive done them a few times and it didnt do anything for me i was in the middle of being a drug addicted pos who was stealing everything i could get my hands on from everyone i loved and i didnt get a feeling of what im doing is wrong to be fair i took a sizable quantity of xanax before the shrooms to in my mind at least keep me from having a bad trip was also on heroin maybe this had some effect i only got recreational value out of it
  ive been a methhead and heroin addict but ive never stolen from people i know never understood why some people do this
  when youre a junkie all the money you have is drug money
  it was the ones you get in a tub i cant remember the name but it was below hawaiian something truffles actually but still i was laughing like a madman in some steakhouse with people staring
  atlantis magic truffles was the name
  thank you you give me hope  i am very intrigued by the concept of resetting your brain because right now there is nothing bad going on in my life but i still carry the debilitating fears and anxiety of my bad childhood and school days  i figured that a reset would be just what i need to get rid of those negative feelings and thoughs        im aware of the potential horror and fear i could encounter during a trip but even if it was 100 guaranteed for me to have a bad time i would do it anyway because the long term results are all i care about and i feel like this is my last chance  do you have any advice on how to make the most out of it   i know that its best to have a friend to assist you the first time around but i dont know about what mindset should i have and what should i do while im under the effect        psychedelic mushrooms are illegal in my country   better go for the safest option available
  ketamine is better for this
  no fuck off
  yes hard drugs like ketamine and heroin will certainly change your life
go to cambodia pick up shrooms ketamine melt it down and smoke it valium and heroin a weeks supply of these can all be had for less than 100 dollars go to phnom penh and go to a pharmacy to pick up the ketamine and valium and tell the tuk tuk driver to take you to find trippy shake or just tell him you want dope and shrooms he will easily get them for you after that fucking go and rent a nice hotel with a pool and go to fucking town another big benefit is youre in the worlds asshole when you wake up so youll feel even better when you get back to civilization
  i dont think mind altering substances are the way to go     me personally i have tried these psylocybin shrooms before and they didnt cure my depression    ironically my sobriety towards everything i used to do weed/alcohol/tobacco/etc and developing a faith in god is what brought legitimate happiness in my life not just surface level happiness but inward joy and satisfaction accompanied with an honest acceptance with myself and everything in my life    regardless of what you choose to do op never give up on your journey to seek happiness i just want to say that you should never depend on anything external to bring you that happiness for only true happiness can be found from within
people ignore all these drugs posts except for mushrooms    they are either trolls or just druggies that like those specific drugs and want to have a good time which has nothing to do with actually caring the root cause of your depression    i speak from personal experience that psylocybin mushrooms can instantly cure your depression its like flipping a switch    please ignore any suggestion that is not psylocybin mushrooms
  how about you enlighten us with your experience with ketamine youre full of shit dont listen to this chode
  thats nice dear youre just used to it sort of like san franciscans are used to living amidst herds of babbling drug addicts shitting all over the sidewalks and illegal aliens randomly shooting people      the proper environment for this is a locked room with a projector showing calming videos of beautiful stuff and soothing music playing in the background not wandering around random city where absolutely anything can happen      see   some of us live in places that have the death penalty for illegal drugs
  anxiety impending doom and hopelessness  do these stick after the trip is over
  well to be honest i tried therapy and it weirldy made everything better so the best trip is a walk to the terapy
  actually micro dosing on ketamine is an actual therapy
do dutch airports do that drug swab thingy  happened to me once in prague and i was very confused cuz i removed all metal because fuck getting checked googled and found out it was drug/explosives testing  never done drugs at that point but id defiantly do them in the netherlands
  i dont think it even matters if you fail a drug swab as long as you dont have drugs on you im pretty sure it just triggers a thorough search
  no in fact they usually get cured the mushrooms just expose you to reality that youve avoided through delusions mushrooms show you your life without any bullshit ego or delusions so you can recover
  kys hippie
  make sure to get the doseage right  it takes about half an hour to really kick in and be surrounded by at least 1 sober person incase you try to do some stupid shit  enjoy nature around you  cats are a plus dogs to be around  feel the environment when i took shrooms i ended up stroking the grass as if it was a puppy and it glew in a yellowish hue  i felt it being alive and was drawn to it  my brothers face kept warping and we all laughed all night  they got the shitters while i was fine but at one point i could barely move and had to lay down then i got hellish visions of green bones a long hallway and kept thinking about the devil coming for me  i felt great the next day and for a few months but then depression kicked back in  shrooms wont fix the root cause of a problem  they merely supress it and let you feel alive and connected to everyother being keep in mind its basically being poisoned  if you are unhappy with something in your life do something against it  sounds cliche but try sports  working out  proper diet  cutting out alcohol and other drugs in your life  not watching porn  not jerking it everyday multiple times  reading books  ride a bycicle keep your mind active at all times besides sleep and you will slowly lessen your depression
  mushrooms show you your life without any bullshit ego or delusions so you can recover  but what if my life is total shit and i already know it
  magic mushrooms are illegal in amsterdam now but they have magic truffles which are pretty nice basically the same thing as far as i know id definitely recommend them but id say do them in a controlled environment we did them out on the streets and amsterdam is a scary city to be a pedestrian even when your sober its the cyclists    i ate a weed brownie in the airport before i went through security non of my friends or anyone else we saw got swabbed
  im a nature lover so i wanted to try them in a park accompanied by an experienced friend   would it be better to just stay indoors
  if the cause of your suffering is purely external trying drugs is pointless  if theres something in your mind thats blocking you like depression apathy or feelings of inadequacy then theyre worth a shot
  magic mushrooms are illegal like how weed is illegal in amsterdam they are still sold in the smartshops and no one is getting arrested the truffles contain exactly the same hallucigen so there is no difference in usage but the mushrooms tend to be more palpable for the stomache
  staying indoors on trips usually feels pretty shitty going to the park or amsterdam forest while its a sunny day is the best though    problem is you need a lot of selfcontrol are you the type of person that can keep himself in check at the most paranoid/fear filled moments in life or are you the guy that loses his cool runs full speed through the streets    if you cant keep your cool then how are you going to deal with a bad trip
  i internalize all my feelings and never let anything out  in a bad trip scenario i imagine i would suffer immensely but not bother anyone else unless the psylocibin itself subverts that  this internalization issue is actually one of the main reasons why i want to try mushrooms
  tried 15g twice nice body high and had a really really good day just fucking off saw some shit move funny a pond started smoking and we sat in a field the sun was shining on trees looked mid ice storm but it was nice out    as far as curing anythibg i dont know good luck they say microdosing does wonders im about to try it
  nah mushrooms are banned now like hard drugs ie coke smart shops only sell truffles though will sometimes still advertise them as mushrooms theres really no point going all the way to amsterdam for mushrooms its just as forbidden as any other country truffles are good though      park would be good in nice weather or amsterdam has a really nice zoo with an aquarium which would be mad youre gonna want to sit on the grass i recommend staying in a hotel or apartment near where youre gonna trip we stayed in a hostel in the red light district miles from the big parks so once the psychedelics kicked in we were basically stranded out there all day would have been nice to have easy access to a toilet without having to worry about buying drinks to gain access to bar toilets and it would have been good to sit on a sofa and chill watch some nature documentaries but i was sort of joking about how scary walking around is if the weather is nice definitely get outside
  it wont be the life changing event you are looking for since you are going about it entirely the wrong way most of those medical studies you are talking about are about guided therapy sessions involving psychoactives  and if you have a bad trip good fucking luck
  guided therapy sessions  not exactly theyre what i keep mentioning   the proper environment for this is a locked room with a projector showing calming videos of beautiful stuff and soothing music playing in the background  they basically just let you trip unless you need company to feel comfortable or are freaking out    even googling to figure out wtf truffles are in this context because i know theyre not the french gastronomic delicacy that costs a fucking fortune brings up articles saying things like    it is always advisable to plan ahead when taking magic truffles as their effects can be overwhelming think comfortable controlled environments like living rooms or bedrooms with comfy sofas blankets and easy access to tap water strolling through green areas like parks or forests is also nice so long as youre 100 certain that youre ok with interacting with strangers etc as this can become quite daunting when youre under the influence    so its not like this is anything unusual its just normal take the shrooms and relax for a few hours not some freudanalyzingyouwhileyourehightotellyouyoursexualhangups or even mysticturdworldshamanidentifyingspiritanimalsforamerifatandyurapeeontrustafarians
  id say full shrooms or lsd are better for depression make sure you do them in a calm environment with people you trust
  they still sell actual mushrooms if you ask for them
  itt fucking idiots  dont do mushrooms to cure your fucking depression      youre the idiot here anon it may sound like some hippy bullshit but mushrooms have been scientifically proven to help depression
  im the opposite of a druggie or hippy im a introverted autist i can confirm from personal experience that using mushrooms has changed my life and cured my depression    take it however you want to do so i dont think its the substance that actually cures your depression i think its the insight you develop during the trip about yourself a fresh look at your life and about your feelings its very harsh but a necessary wakeup call
  therapy is a meme prescription drugs even more so
i did mushroom right after my exfiance/gf of six years and i split man oh man did i hate my life    i dont remember the song but i curled up under a blanket with my phone on the lowest volume just listening and everyone else was too high to help me    flash forward after being miserable for a month i refuse to accept defeat from this psychadelic so i do it again 5 times now in total 4 grams each time i feel better even when the old thoughts come by they dont hit anywhere near as hard and lifes good    good luck
be careful  i did shrooms 1 one time and got hppd for a year and dpdr that i still cant get rid of
  1 in 50000 regular users once a week for a year or longer develop hppd dpdp has an even lower rate    chances of it happening to you are basically 0 from 1 single time having both from 1 use either means you are lying or you are the one in a trillion lottery losers
im going to amsterdam tomorrow any advice for buying weed at the coffee shops are the prerolled joints legit or are they filled with crap    what would you recommend for a non weed smoker
  the prerolled are legit but if you can roll then id recommend doing that as its cheaper so you could smoke more    ive worked at a coffeeshop for 3 years avoid the bulldog and buy the cheapest weed available the employees in coffeeshops sometimes tend to just switch out the more expensive breeds with cheaper ones to pocket the difference unbeknownst to their boss    you can smoke weed absolutely everywhere dont be afraid to step out of the coffeeshop and smoke it in the park or while walking in public fuck everyone on /trv/ saying this is unacceptable because it absolutely is and noone will mention or even care about it
  avoid the bulldog    why
  overpriced lower quality weed and lower quality services its an overly touristic place kinda the mcdonalds of weed no one that knows their stuff goes to that place just avoiding the bulldog is good enough to get higher quality weed for a lower price    drugs is not shady in amsterdam so dont be the dude that gets shifty when he is exposed to coke/xtc/heroin etc cops dont give a fuck as long as you arent fucking other people up you can even buy kits to test the purity if your drugs and methkits at smartshops have fun man
  youre going to amsterdam just to do shrooms not for the architecture the food the culture the history the women the night life the day life etc for shrooms yeah you should totally travel to do drugs being in a foreign country high out of your mind sounds like a great idea     you cant do shrooms in your own country like a normal person shrooms are illegal in the usa where i live but i have still done them i didnt need to travel to amsterdam ask any of your stoner friends its guaranteed one of them will know someone who can get them for you
    ok cool thanks
  why are you so concerned with one anons decision to travel you seem like a wet blanket and probably not someone people would go out of their way to hang out with
  it actually is a lot of fun though kek
  yes
  but find company
  as someone born and raised in amsterdam    not for the architecture  overrated but it might be cool if youve never seen it i guess  the food  hahahahahaha  the culture  stoicism is barely a culture i accept this if you meant arthistory instead of our actual culture  the history  whoops nevermind yeah our history and art are great and among the best on the globe but our culture is about being as blunt as possible and to never give a fuck about anything which could barely be called culture  the women  local women are nothing special except for being tall most dont date foreigners anyway because foreigners are considered low quality due to dutch women being exceptionally educated and women dont date under their education level usually postgrad if you meant prostitutes then yeah you are right  the night life  amazing and drugfilled however the people you will party with will mostly consist of other tourists as dutch tend to stick together and have rave/house parties instead official nightlife is more considered a tourist activity  the day life  doesnt exist unemployment is only 3 streets are empty during the day because everyone is working
    this guy gets it
suppose that as a white guy you wanted to become an expat in order to find four women to practice polygamy with what would be the best country to move to
utah
you need a lot of money to do this unless you want to shack up with weird ugly internet people
  contrary to popular belief islamic countries where that is legal require you to be a muslim to do it  also youre way better off joining a commune than trying to be responsible for four women in a society where youre expected to work to support them all because they have to stay at home  also my wife makes jokes about this all the time and i always tell her that i couldnt deal with two of her let alone four i tell her this because its true one wife is quite enough for most husbands once youre married youll probably understand
  commune  some sort of polyamory commune though could be great provided that youre someone that theyll actually want
  this    ironically move to the west coast of the us i got introduced to polyamory/open relationships there ive lived in other countries since then but usually most poly people are chubby or unattractive so your chances for normal goodlooking poly people are west coast
whats the most beautiful place within an approximate 1000 mile drive from new york city in canada or the us id be open to pretty much anything distance from civilization isnt a huge factor i plan on either camping out or sleeping in the car
  id head up through delaware water gap the catskills then through ithaca adirondacks if you have time plenty of space to camp but pretty remote and freeze your balls off in winter then go through vermont and new hampshire white mountains and finally through maine to acadia national park theres lots of scenic areas nature hills and woods some nice lakes and streams etc but its not exactly breathtaking beauty that part of canada as far as ive seen is similar    theres also the smoky mountains not nearly as cold in winter but still chilly could hit like cape hatteras or something too if you went that way
can we have an amazon river thread i would love to go fishing all day and fry fish n chips everynight as well as see some wildlife
  you dont have to go to the amazon for a great fishing trip anon
did a cruise through the amazon last year all the areas are pretty poor and pick on tourists coming through    that being said the highlights were seeing the meeting of the rivers amazon and tapajos in santarem boating around alter do chao and seeing a small snippet of the boi bamba festival in parintins i would love to go back during the actual festival i heard the town goes absolutely nuts    actually didnt do much nature related stuff but pink dolphins were a daily sight and pirahna fishing was everywhere although the quality seemed hit and miss even with my brazilian friend translating
  actually didnt do much nature related stuff  that seems really strange  my impression was that there was pretty much fuck all other than nature along the amazon
  its true even manaus is essentially a shithole i just never got a chance to spend time in the forest and get really inmersed     we went to this one village that was pretty much built for tourists all the kids had little sloths and capybaras that they would use to get a few reais off of you i gave some candy to a friend to give to the children and they nearly ripped her arms off
  this  also its barely accessible not many options and the few that exists are unreliable and overpriced because they know stupid tourists will pay for anything are you just really eager to be eaten by mosquitoes and shit in the woods op
  off exists
anybody done a smallship amazon cruise which i guess may be what everybody has done whos been there i dont know    but im looking into that for the next trip with my wife and adultish children

what should one do in taiwan   donno see stuff eat stuff and bang stuff    dos and donts  when seeking helps and/or advices goes to youth while i believe most will still try to help you the lacks of english speaking ability wont do anything good most collage students and high schooler can at least understand what you are saying if cant have full conversation with you so they are more likely to know what you need  avoid political topic i repeat avoid political topic  we literally have a major election and referendum yesterday and i am sure lots of people are butthurt over it right now dragon dildo tier butthurt avoid political topic if you are having a chat wont hurt you     i drive a scooter without an international drivers licence  from my experience you will need your license when you are renting your rides but when you hit the road you really wont need it if youre not acting suspiciously cops wont bother to check  spoilerheck i rode mine to the dmvequivalent when i was getting my license/spoiler    how are the women  since i have no experience i have no comment on this  spoilerso close sigh/spoiler    which food dishes are not to be missed  if you are coming to tainan city baoan roadthe section between ximen road and haian road and guohua streetgo north starting from baoan road is the way just eat the fuck out of these two
  thank you care to elaborate on the election what was it about in a nutshell       not even bottled water how come
  what was it about in a nutshell  the usual shit kmt wants power dpp wants to block the kmts power kmt basically wants to sell out the country to china so they can negotiate a higher position for themselves in the ccpcontrolled special administrative region government dpp wants taiwan to be its own free little country kmt wants to pander to aboriginal groups so they get votes from them dpp wants to confiscate all the money the kmt stole during the decades of martial law kmt wants to crush the skulls of all the taiwanren and so on and so on    oh and the homofags wanted to get married and are all anally impacted because the population said marriage is between a man and a woman just go blow each other and spread syphilis amongst yourselves
  not even bottled water  yes because  normally these kind of no eating policy would bar water out but not in this case  there are lines at the checkpoint in each mrt stations and maokong gundolas and bins you either finish your stuff there throw them in the bin or restrain your hunger until you leave the system
  this is from another anon in a galaxy far far away i always repost it because their guide is really handy    im going with my taiwanese gf for the last week of jan and all of feb her place is in taipei and using the mrt and family car were doing the whole island   taipei to hsinchu then to taichung then to sun moon lake going back to taipei then down to hualien up to jiufen and surrounding area then back to taipei   at this point were going to kaohsiung and im heading off for alone time in xiao liu qiu island then back to taiwan to go further south then back up along the east coast   id be really keen to have dinner with anyone too if you want i know the missus wont let me meet new people if theyre female haha so meeting people on here will at least give both of us a break from each other
  dos and donts  visit all night markets you can go to jiufen mostly for the views go on a weekday  hike elephant mountain visit the national park in taitung go to taroko gorge and enjoy the calmness in the smaller cities at night    dont dont rush too much i think my mistake was i wanted to see a lot of cities in a too short time you can better then not visit them at all since you dont know what you miss you havent seen if you want more detailed recs ask me been there for a month in 2017 been to pretty much every city except chiayi  scooter without international drivers license  not at the places ive seen  women  very hit or miss the extremely hot ones are really top notch in asia i feel like even in korea the really hot ones arent as good looking as in taiwan but theres a lot of girls who dont give a damn about how they look or are chubby  i dated one girl there who was decently looking but crazy good body for an asian she was a bit of a headcase though broke contact shortly after leaving i think it might be hard to get with one although i have been able to meet a lot of them via internet even cancelled appointments because some were getting too thirsty  food  din tai fung is a must but leave the side dishes there behind not too special for me as a westerner and pretty expensive the xiao long bao is amazing  eat sashimi at the east coast try out some hand made noodles beef soup try out hot pot and try out some oysters furthermore theres all kinds of specialities at night markets everywhere that theres a line the food must be good popcorn chicken is awesome as well theres a great one in ximen serving it i even likes the rice noodles there which are very popular even though people can be critical about it    more questions shoot
    this is bullshit there are no checkpoints and its getting impossible to find trash bins at the mrt because they keep removing them because muh terrorism they dont care even if you carry stuff on board people bring drinks or are carrying their dinner home from the night market to eat at home all the time    youre just not supposed to actively eat or drink while in the stations or on the trains because they dont want people to spill anything and make a mess    even then they dont really mind if its just water particularly if youre taking medication i had to do that for months and even when there was a cop on board he never said anything    every time i go to costco i bring back my soda on the train nobody even looks at me for it technically that really is against the rules because its got a straw in it and its easy for the top to pop off and spill all over    the absolute worst that ever happened was when i was new and brought a bigass bottle of tea with me and started drinking it while on the escalator going down to the platform and an mrt employee was coming up the other escalator he shook his finger at me and i realized what i was doing and stopped and capped it end of story      repost when youre about to come over i might still be in town or maybe not have to head home for a while to take care of shit       without international drivers license  not at the places ive seen  varies in the highly tourist areas like kenting they dont check i had no problem renting there and i dont even have a valid dl any more expired much less an idl
    nice man ill definitely post again before i get there currently booking all the accommodation now as my partner didnt want to worry about it before exams so far its half done and ive only spend a quarter of my budget    decided ill spend two nights at xiao liu qiu instead of one as i can afford it now and would love the personal space     any idea about eating exotic shit like snake or even better snake wine/strength tonic thats been on my bucket list since watching city of violence
  im not sure if snake alley even exists any more i heard the shops all closed this article seems to confirm    www dot taiwannews dot com dot tw slash en slash news slash 3435964    fuck the antispam filter    you can probably still find them on the menu and on the shelves somewhere just not the out and proud places may have better luck down south or in the aboriginal areas  theyll eat anything there
  thanks man im interested in hikes in taipei      when i go to a store and they ask me if i need a bag or a receipt what is a correct way to answer is a wo bu yao too impolite
  any suggestions for smaller towns at night near taipei
  pingxi has a lot of little nice towns plus the lanterns are beautiful regardless of the environmental impact
  the cop went out of his way not to ticket me  im interested in what you mean by that and how that went
  the cop pulled me over along with several other scootards because following the herd through the left fork of a yintersection silly me cannot into chinese signs and went with the flow of dozens of other scootards and had been doing it for literally a couple of years by then    anyway he tickets all the other scootards and then its my turn he waves his hands and tries to express that im not allowed to go through the intersection and have to take the other road im all like i cannot into mandarin much less chinese but i figure ill ask around later then he lets me go very nice of him    later i find out on le reddit that theres a tunnel scootards are supposed to divert through and were not allowed to go through that intersection which is actually nice because its a fucking dangerous intersection design and the tunnel bypasses it entirely i dont know why all the chinamen dont use it
  i dont know if hsinchu is small enough for you but i really liked it there only been there for a few hours though    i checked into our hotel walked a bit around the city and saw a lot of south eastern shops after that i went to the temple night market which was cool during night i went to the arcade which is opened for 24 hours a day and played tekken for a bit when i went back to my hotel i felt such a sense of freedom and quietness that was an amazing highlight    there was a semioutdoors arcade there as well which isnt used a lot at all i burned some coins there punching bags and stuff i liked it so if this sounds interesting to you i advise you to go there the feeling i got could be very personal though
  visited in may/june 2017 and snake alley definitely still existed back then they also served snakes there still wasnt really curious to try it but walked through the alley a few times      lots of possibilities for you theres the forest in the west too havent been able to go there but i saw some nice videos from there
  thats because if you read the article youll learn that the last snake restaurant closed down on may 21 2018
protipgo to ximen at the 8th floor of the showtime cinema there is a reallycool arcade where you can shoot diablo guns and play baseball and other cool stuff
    fuck man im sure therell be some place selling it just gotta work through the language barrier bullshit because my partner hates snakes and probably wouldnt translate      got any more protips because i am very interested
any places where they do car meets and stuff like daikoku in japan
  tell you what ill ask around i dont get out much but i have to go into taipei tomorrow for a meeting anyway
north coast kite festival thread  
    thanks man im interested in hikes in taipei    theres a shit ton of hikes to do but i recommend starting with elephant mountain and its many paths if youre up for a challenge theres a climb deep into the trail that gives you an amazing view of taipei unhindered by other travelers    id post the pic but apparently its too big for /trv/s standards
  what should one do in taiwan   depends how long you are there for i recommend taipei obviously lots of stuff to see and do clubs museums restaurants chiang kai shek memorial    tarako is a must its so beautiful get there via hualian  kenting is very nice beautiful clear sea nice beaches if you go there stop by player bar and talk to the owner wei ting   and donts  do talk to people usually in taipei english level is quite good do try food in the night markets do no throw litter on the ground   i drive a scooter without an international drivers licence  you can ride an electric one legally and petrol one ilegally    are the women  100 matches in 1 days on tinder in kaohsiung    food dishes are not to be missed  beef noodle soup mala hot pot dumplings
  avoid political topic i repeat avoid political topic  i was pissed out my head in hengchun and talking politics to locals they found me really funny  probably just stupid weigworan
  if you want to eat these shaved ice with beans and stuff mixes go to dafang ice deserts huge portions and cheap
is it easy to get from taipei to and from jiufen village in a day or should i book a hotel there for one night
not op but going to taiwan in january    thanks a ton
  yes very easy we left taipei at around 330pm arrived there at around 500pm had some tea and took some photos then went back to taipei at around 730pm because there wasnt much to do really we rode a new bus route no 965 its a bus trip that takes you directly to jiufen without having to change buses or train    theres some more bus routes i think theres also the train to ruifang and bus option look it up
where around la to stay thats kinda cool less or no toursists and preferably dont have to wear a flack jacket   going with a friend for 3 concerts staying for 5 days enjoy local shit hipster shit holes in the wall  music and surfing god bless   also were from the miami i am not a fan
except for bali what would you recommend where have you been    bandung has great food for cheap stay away from aceh and irian timor is included havent met much expats
  manado is pretty great its like a more chill bali it has the nice scenery but way less hawking from the locals and drunken bule everywhere
how are the girls there
  my friend was an exchange student for a year banged virgins and stuff but he became an ill person circumsized himself
  how best to meet em if there on vacation
  if youre only interested in virgins then the easiest is tinder the virgins are usually muslim and wont be at the bars
  did he actually bang them my virgin wanted to remain a virgin and just wanted to do it up the ass she was super cute though i was only in indonesia for a short time so didnt get as many chances with them as i would if i stayed longer am thinking of going for a few months next time
  my virgin wanted to remain a virgin and just wanted to do it up the ass  so theyre basically like catholic high school girls    i dont know what it is about the catholic church and anal
  well they want to remain virgins so the bloodstain on the sheets grants them access to paradise nothing complicated bruh
  whatever you want to compare it to i didnt like it the girl didnt know what she was doing having sex with a virgin is a major fantasy but even me as a 4chan weird didnt enjoy it i guess im not looking for a village bicycle slut but at least someone who knows how to give a good blow job would be great
  slutty but ugly
  where do you get weed and shrooms in bali just ask any cabbie or expat
  dont not worth the risk they execute druggies in indonesia look up bali nine    i met a virgin cutie via tinder while in jakarta didnt get to fuck because she was on her period and i couldnt be arsed with her the next day     indonesia is full of virgins but as the guy above said its not as awesome as you incels think it is
  the bali nine is the name given to a group of nine australians convicted for attempting to smuggle 83 kg 18 lb of heroin out of indonesia in april 2005 the heroin was valued at around a4 million and was bound for australia    i mean thats not exactly what i had in mind just a few days worth of joints
  yes
  sure go ahead you druggie scumbag enjoy prison or paying bribes
  srsly
  i dont mind paying bribes it happens often enough when driving my bike as the cops are fully aware that a white guy has no licence and that equals free money to them
recs for lombok east java and flores / komodo np over december and january
  i was in lombok this year but in august survived earthquake in shopping mall while trying to buy chicken 10/10 would recommend again i was in kuta 2 weeks and near sekotong another 2 weeks id advice this places skip up matarampure shit its like india in nutshell in kuta there are lot of pubs and clubs so if you enjoy party nightlife its even better for you places in sekotong locations like gilis i found more natural was also on sotheast java in situbondo location for 2 days my feelings are relatively close to bali or lombok maybye not so much tourists and roads were in worse condition
  is that the extent of your problems when you have no license i drive in laos and cambodia without a license i hardly ever get stopped but 125cc is legal for anyone without a license of course with whitey the rules do not apply
  if you go to java hit up bromo or another volcano and borobudur yogyakarta is a scummy town but borobudur really is a wonder while also a tourist trap also what    said sulawesi is chill and fun and the least islamic of the main islands     t born in manado
damn i am liking the virgin thing i guess they want to get married and such afterwards i like ive got some cash saved up and need a break seems like paradise
  i usually pay less than 10e they even take me to the closest atm       have done bromo borobudur and jogja youre spot on
  bump
    just got back from indo what do you want to know
  how easy are the women from 1 not possible to 10 billionaire in thialand and what about the virgins there is it really that easy to bag them
      where in indonesia did you find these women
  go jakarta
  could you really find virgins and/or women willing to marry you there i mean thatd be pretty easy just going to the capital city
  why are people obsessed with easy girls and virgins but drugs are a huge nono
  4chan is filled with unpopular uncool people most of them were not offered drugs by their peers because they had few or no friends they interacted too much with older generations their parents grandparents who have negative views of drugs and as such develop the same views for themselves
  because fucking virgins doesnt carry the death penalty
    samefag
    oh dont get me wrong im extremly fond of drugs 3 trips to rehab and over 100k wasted on heroin i dont see why we cant have easy women and drugs its a match made in heaven
  you can find them almost everywhere to be honest but some spots will be easier than others first of all you want to go away from the tourist masses bali lombok yogya and any diving island in those spots theres plenty of beach bum chads that the girls have an easy time finding someone    i havent traveled around the whole country so i cant say how good it is in sumatra where i guess theyre more religious if i were to say the best spots for this would be in big cities with large student populations jakarta bandung surabaya malang im just listing javan cities as thats where ive been    i found mine on tinder she was super cute 24 uni degree spoke perfect english had a job and didnt seem like she was looking for money or marriage she had a brand new iphone      why would you want to marry them
  virgin did you pay how fast did you seal the deal
how hard would it be to find a girl as cute as ops pic thats a virgin thatd be willing to fuck this sounds too good to be true is this a disinfo thread
  in the phillippines no issue just as long as you have some money but if you go there expecting to woo her with your teachers salary she will be dirt poor and rural
  op girl  cute
  im the guy whose virgin wanted to remain a virgin not paying i found her on tinder im an ugly slightly overweight 30something guy from canada she was 24 cute petite maybe 53 i messaged her cause when i added her on tinder her profile said not available so i said only available for me and then she said we should meet up and she said she wanted to do stuff in bed anyways i didnt enjoy it that much cause she was so inexperienced but ive never been with a virgin before so thats kinda interesting
  dude that sounds like a cool fucking time did you keep in touch man busting nuts in virgins is the best feeling in the world to me especially some poor third worlder i have two kids like that in the states from virgin women who were dumb as rocks this is my weirdest and most costly fetish but god damn i enjoy it will look into this and if so ill go soon just inhereted a small amount from a passing family member probably just enough to have a blast there lol
  haha that sounds awful to me but you do you i guess i think i want to live in a city in asia for a bit that way ill actually have time to date around im not really looking for virgins but i just want a bunch of side chicks and i know in asia this would be super easy for me i have the money to do it but im kinda money hungry and instead of fucking my way through asia im studying here like a little bitch all on my own for months to get into business school /
  im desperate for a wife desu
  why would you want to marry them  why wouldnt you
  uhh because there are better options out there these girls have little to no value other than their body its a very bleak way of looking at it but there are plenty of women like this around the world who will give you little to no benefit in life other than holes to fuck      are you like some of those 60 year old german men who go to thailand to find a wife why would anyone be desperate to get married whats your situation like
  yeah it dosnt really make sense to me either and im the weirdo who likes getting them pregnant youd be better off to give someone half your shit to come over and kick you in the dick every day the rest of your life at least then they dont stay around and hound you fuck
  im in my early 20s but im pretty much autistic especially around women and wanna have kids soon
  you should look for new immigrants to your country where are you from for example here in canada you can find a lot of new immigrant women taking esl classes and many of them are looking to date local guys cause they want to stay here in canada theyre either japanese/korean or from mexico but obviously from many other mostly asian and latin american countries of course it might be a bit more difficult as they probably have other local guys looking at dating them but give it a try first    its so fucking expensive to deal with bringing a woman back home a friend of mine married a ukrainian woman and it cost him tens of thousands for all the fees now shes earning minimum wage cause no one decent will hire her without local education/experience when back in ukraine she finished a masters degree and held a lucrative for their standards sales job    im in a bit of a similar situation as you except im over 30 now and my clock is ticking to find someone but i dont want to be stuck with a burden like this
  you find them in surabaya boring city but theres 3 million people there and its white god mode on steroids use tinder or just try the malls
im planning on going for 5 weeks next may thinking about doing maybe the crossborneo trek which takes up to 3 weeks or maybe some shorter hiking tours/trips anyone got any recs not so much in it for bars/clubs/parties or museums/temples more for nature and walking/snorkelling and similar bit vague but any info appreciated
  im also canadian but i feel like meeting someone overseas through tinder or something would be easier than trying to find a woman from teaching them english here    to be fair though my aunts found their husbands that way but theyre white women so it was pretty easy for them
  it only works in vancouver and toronto i think lots of japanese and korean students here and lately more and more brazilians much more girls than guys in those esl schools as well    and theyre all on tinder here as well you dont meet them by teaching them you either find them on old or you have to somehow integrate into the esl group
  well the deal is you train them up the way you want them to be but they have to want the same things too if you want your girl to walk around with bondage gear under her clothes and your dried semen on her tits then she has to be the sort of chick who valued her virginity enough to save it for marriage and then wants to be a huge slut for her man    any chick can be trained to give a blowjob as long as she isnt so terrified of sex or sin that she refuses and i guess as long as she isnt a literal retard    if you pick a virgin whos so hung up on religion that she will only have sex in the missionary position for the sole purpose of procreation then youre kinda out of luck      not the same guy but id want to marry them because id like to have kids before i die its not that far off ive been having increasingly worse heart trouble almost died three years ago massive blood pressure spike stretched out every blood vessel in my body just random luck that i only ended up with a small stroke instead of a major blowout next time one that bad happens ill either be dead or be so disabled that id want someone to pull the plug    life is short and uncertain eat dessert first until you get diabetes anyway and then you can switch to bacon
  am i misreading your comment or do you not think anal sex counts as sex
  it still counts but pussy is pussy nothing beats it      never had to train a virgin before so i dont know what that entails but i feel like it would involve a lot of dead starfish positions for her before anything good came of it
in bandung looking for easy girls and something to get high off with them anyone
  mommy  give me indon gf now
  get high  in indonesia  rip bro
  why is indonesia so shit about light drugs is that the case in bali too i thought shrooms were widely available there and gili what about alcohol
  not knowing about technical virgins and catholic schoolgirls  its the chicks who think anal doesnt count its kind of weird but the catholic girls all seemed to think anal didnt count but didnt extend the same thinking to oral    i guess nowadays that whole thing is dead though kids are fucking each other up the ass by fourth grade and trying to decide whether theyre trans or bi by fifth if their parents havent already started them on hormones since kindergarten      it really comes down to whether the girl wants to enjoy sex or not and i suppose also whether youre any good at it    my first gf was a virgin and had so much anxiety about sex that she would pass out before she could orgasm she wasnt a dead fish when it came to oral but the few times we tried anything else it was just impossible    second one had only done oral before me or so she claimed she turned into a total willing slut under my tutelage any hole any time unless she was on the rag or was constipated
  i guess nowadays that whole thing is dead though kids are fucking each other up the ass by fourth grade and trying to decide whether theyre trans or bi by fifth if their parents havent already started them on hormones since kindergarten  damm i was born too soon _
  eh its just an oldfags rant about the youth these days
  jealousy you mean sounds pretty great to me i didnt have sex until i was in college i think i would have been a lot more well adjusted if i had been anally sexing that little chinese girl who sat in front of me when we were in 4th grade instead of just pulling her pigtails and being forced to stay after class and write selfreflection essays
can anyone recommend or share experiences of good spots and towns to live in to surf
    bumping for this
  rent a van and bring some friends  take a road trip from jakarta to singapore then stop over in bali  we could be men in ven
  i had a neighbor get blown up in a terrorist attack when he was over in bali to surf it fucked him up right good but he lived so i always assumed surfing in bali would be good considering we lived on a beach with pretty good surf
  too many tourists now too polluted
  is your van amphibious
  bali uluwatu
  not so much to do there unless you go to malaysian part of borneo tho
ive been considering about travelling to new york for a week next year if i do manage to go what should i expect /trv/ is it any good
its good
its great fun if you have a bit of money stay in the right area and enjoy restaurants and bars    theres worldclass food for almost any budget museums and galleries arent as good as london but are wroth visiting     i recommend going to the tkts booth for some sameday theater tickets dont go to the times square one though go to the south street seaport because theres less queue and you can do it the same time as something else like the wtc or ferry
  theres worldclass food for almost any budget  note that this applies only if you are from a wealthy country with a high standard of living the prices for everything in nyc are high as fuck for food just use the guiding principle of trying to eat stuff that you cant normally get    go to the moma and natural history museum go to parks other than central park but see if there is any good live event there like a concert or theater if youre using airbnb book far in advance and expect to not be that close to manhattan if you dont want to spend a half your yearly wage     the rest depends entirely on what you are interested in
need help deciding where to go in january   usa southern roadtrip    morocco/spain   hong kong/singapore    mexico city/playa del carmen/cancun   south korea     my gf and i cant decide any personal favorites suggestions places that suck the best     we live in maine have 11 days total and are experienced fast travelers any help is welcome
  get some barbeque each state in the south has extremely different styles beaches are best in the rural parts of the florida panhandle grab some seafood at mobile/panhandle its godlike not sure what you want to see in oklahoma instead i would suggest seing some historical civil rights/confederate stuff in montgomery im an alabamian though so im probably biased go to chris hot dogs if you go to montgomery its a great place with a lot of history also drop by the first white house of the confederacy tons of cool stuff and great guides enjoy
  oh make sure to get some goobers theyre boiled peanuts you can find in most gas stations and a lot of other places in alabama theyre one of the best and most unique snacks you can get try golden flake too southern exclusive with great chips
  what are your interests and how old are you mexico or the caribbean would be good if you wanna relax in the sun    go to a metropolitan area in korea or hong kong/singapore if you guys are into clubbing this is where i would go but i feel like there is less appeal if you are in a relationship    i know nothing about spain but i would say a southern roadtrip would be a huge waste compared to any of these other places unless you are planning on going to florida for a week i dont really see the appeal here i am from a very popular tourist trap spot in virginia and i can tell you from experience there is a whole lot of nothing to do in january    if you get anything out of this post dont do the roadtrip unless you just wanna stay in florida for a week it will probably not be nearly as good as any of the other things
is it possible for a shitslav like me
bimp
  if youre slavic its a piece of piss youre part of the eu why would it even be difficult
haarlem is for the win
  nah i am russian piece of shit not part of eu
  when i was in high school all the fat kids in my business marketing class said they wanted to move to norway when they graduated thats the end of my story
should i say that haarlem brevery rocks
dafuq dutch guys reply to me
    what do you do for work you basically just need to work out how to get a job permit    you speak english pretty well so you might be able to find a job in a helpdesk or some other low level it/customer service role    hey worst case scenario move to hungary plenty of service desk jobs there
what is your attitude towards newfags
  i am a piece of engeneering hope that i am so
shitty bimp
  if youre in engineering youll be fine    your last sentence makes me think your english isnt so good though    take english classes for 6 months and focus on it like fuck afterwards youll be fine
do you speak dutch fluently no then stay the fuck away
bimp
  i can learn it
  nah i was just drunk
dafaq
but it needs a visa for me to visit eu and it counts for 90 days afaik
ah wish i could live in a decent country
i am from netherlands  nobody will respect you  no girl wants your dick because slavs are looked down upon in nl    sorry bro
  nah its ok i dont look for a pussyes just want to live a peaceful life cause living in russia sucks
  you can come if you bring your qt sisters
  living in russia sucks  polfag delusions crushed but what about that white waifu what about that stern but fair system what about the camaraderie of white brethren
  the netherlands somehow always has had jobs for engineers you should be fine what kind of engineering did you study
  if you are not dutch you have no right to live in the netherlands
davaj bratan )))    im a slav and i live in the netherlands for uni its fine but dutch people are weird as shit
im australian  what are my chances like dutch brehs
  dutch immigration is based on degree if you have a bachelors degree it must be in engineering if you want to make any chance    masters degree can be in most academics and phd means guaranteed immigration    however dutch society might not be as good as youd expect the number one complaint among male immigrants is that its extremely hard to find a partner as dutch men and women are the tallest people in the world and its a big taboo in the netherlands to date a guy shorter than the woman the average height in the netherlands is 62 and this takes immigrants and refugees into account the real dutch average is probably around 6364 and those are the average so guys considered tall and dateable are even taller than that    i personally am 62 and have always been the shortie in class it was not uncommon to have female classmates that were taller than me and i would get bullied for it    there is also some weird dutch stoicism going on that immigrants have a hard time to understand its like australian banter its just a part of the culture but if you cant get a feeling for it youll just think dutch people are very robotic and unemotional while its just a sort of dutch type of crude humor    besides that most expats and immigrants tend to love the country
  white waifu what about that stern but fair system  ahahahhahahahahahah  t russian not op
i have a bachelors degree in politics and history my grades got me into a well paying govt job im 62 as well ive met a fair few dutch people ive actually never met a tall female though
please keep in mind that the dutch education system has the highest standards in the world a lot of times your university degree isnt recognized in the netherlands or only rated on the same quality as a dutch highschool diploma or an associates degree
dont go to the netherlands its overcrowded to the point that now they are starting to hate all foreigners go to germany since you are russian you would fit well in eastern germany
  the average height in the netherlands is 62  not even true  retard
  the average height in the netherlands is 62 and this takes immigrants and refugees into account the real dutch average is probably around 6364 and those are the average so guys considered tall and dateable are even taller than that  average dutch height is 51160 and for women its only 5657 and i know plenty of men in the 5658 range who have had no problem dating the problems start when you are 55 or shorter
    maybe its not true but i live in the north of the country and i am 62 and was bullied for usually being the shortest dude in class maybe southern dutch are shorter with only a 60 average height    but again average doesnt mean attractive you need to be at least that height to not be immediately rejected
  russians  white    i believe i know who the delusional one is
  guys that are under 58 look like literal children here even thats pushing it im also 62 and feel average at best though im aware the data doesnt support my sentiment
  please keep in mind that the dutch education system has the highest standards in the world  thats switzerland jan van den inferiority complex
  its all relative and exagerated    guys who are 57510 are still able to get women but its easier if theyre taller but its not like impossible if youre shorter thats just dumb height really isnt everything     ive got my last three girlfriends by being you know nice    not a nice guy just a good dependable guy despite being 58    then i fuck them in the ass
      i believe i know who the delusional one is  thats vodka kahlua and cream isnt it
  with my microdick
starting a thread to discuss journeys or whatever else you want to call them    share your stories of riding a horse thru mongolia  motorbike thru countries  thru hike wild lands    i rode my motorcycle all over the us ask me if you want  does anyone know any good countries to ride a motorbike in and go on a real long ride maybe even thru multiple countries or am i better off doing it on a bicycle instead of hassling with vehicle laws
do you think its worth getting my drivers license so i am able to buy a motorcycle to tour abroad    i live in a country where a drivers license is completely unnecessary and i will probably never have a car and the total cost is between 30005000 usd to get a drivers license here    i always hear people say riding through vietnam and the like is amazing but is it worth studying months for and wasting such a large amount of money
you could probabaly just do the ride without the liscense  i rode all over thailand on a rental moto and i know they made a copy of my passport but dont know if they asked for drivers liscense
    hitchhiked through europe when i was 20 got tear gassed in gezi park and have motorbiked all over india and the himalayas had a good few adventures but am hoping to find some semblance of stability sooner than later though i cant imagine staying in my own country or state forever     probably going to take some time away from grad school to take a motorcycle trip from the rust belt to panama or argentina depending on how much money and how many months ill have     the two tours i really want to do when im still young are the aforementioned latin america motorbike expedition and a proper sixmonth long twowheeler trip across india     if anybody has experience with motorcycling through latin america do you have to arrange new insurance policies at every border whats the cost like i checked a quote for mexico online and the rates were surprisingly inexpensive how hard do customs officers fuck you so far as bribes go
  would love to hear more about riding india  did you do it on the enfield any idea if its possible to ride into neighboring countries  did you camp at all
    ive ridden in india on an enfield and a yamaha i actually own a royal enfield in the united statesits an awful bike albeit easy to repair and wellsuited for indian roads     im not sure about riding into other countries making an educated guess id say in order to do that you probably have to have the bike registered in your name that can be a bit tricky to do as a foreign national though ive heard that some dealerships will find ways to make it work     so far as camping goes ive done it but not in conjunction with motorbiking i did a series of independent hikes in kashmir in 2014 wild camping isnt common in india among foreign tourists and domestic travelers people would probably think youre weird for doing it away from the himalayas but youd probably be fine as long as you use some common sense in choosing a campground     heres a pic from the spiti valley about an hour west of kaza     i think riding in the mountains is overrated definitely do it if you have the time but explore other parts of india that arent himachal pradesh and rajasthan the friendliest and least obnoxious people ive come across in india have been in states like chhattisgarh jharkhand and odisha which have pockets of insurgency and are seldom visited by foreigners w    also heard good things about the northeast but havent yet visited
  did you buy or rent those bikes  how much do you have to spend to get a decent bike  are hondas godtier am i right common
i spent two and a half years road tripping and doing seasonal jobs on a shitbox 99 chevy lumina that i bought for 100 washington idaho oregon california nevada utah and up to alaska  back  it was still running when i sold it for 250
what are your thoughts on brazil
  well their soups are the best i could easily find tell ya
brazilian cities are quite boring and the high crime makes it difficult to explore them properly like you would most asian cities for example  there are some amazing natural spots like lençóis maranhenses bonito or a few mountains that are easy enough for a beginner to climb if youre into that only problem being the tourist infrastructure isnt very good and theyre far away from each other  also very few people speak english or a second language that isnt improvised spanish think of brazil as a south africa with no english speakers and no investment in tourism   tbh the whole crime thing makes this a country you should only visit if youre in a group or with a local or you can wait another 2 years until bolsonaros death squads has an effect and crime starts going down its long overdue shit been out of control since the mid 90s in brazil
cool place i was there recently for a week but only in rio     i was in ipanema and copacobana though so it was pretty isolated from most crime it was pretty vibrant and there were people everywhere especially on the beach in copacabana     not many people speak english though which kind of sucked
brazil is a great country if you speak portuguese because brazilians dont speak english    cities are fun to explore and extremely different where you go they have great history and cheap food for great prices the good thing is that their cities are always good points for exploring the countryside as well go to manaus and take a trip to the amazon go to são luis and visit lençois maranhenses go to salvador and visit chapada diamantina and so on if you are a retard who does no research you might think that brazilian cities are unsafe but actually they are perfectly safe to explore unless you wander in a favela for cities i really liked the following    manaus opera house  belem decaying colonial greatness great markets and easy point to go to ilha marajo  são luis feels like a run down version of lisbon  recife olinda is pretty fun  salvador beautiful city with a gorgeous colonial center and has lots of african influence  rio de janeiro no city on this planet comes close to what rio has to offer in terms of natural beauty  são paulo mega city and the cultural capital of brazil  brasilia most unique city in the world if you love architecture  belo horizonte for me the best food in all of brazil goat restaurants for cheap prices  ouro preto and colonial towns of minas gerais    then brazil obviously has great nature and a lot of national parks that are quite different as well  amazon take a boat from manaus to belem takes 56 days  alter do chão white sand beaches in the amazon  ilha do marajo ride on buffalos   lençois maranhenses white sand desert filled with blue/green water  fernando de noronha beautiful beaches one of the best in the world  chapada diamantina vale do pati trek is unique in south america  pantanal see jaguars exotic birds and other animals  bonito clear rivers great for snorkeling  chapada dos veadeiros beautiful waterfalls
 continue    the big negatives about brazil is that the tourist infrastructure is shit and you absolutely need a car if you want to visit anything without wasting a lot of money on poorly done tours and as i said brazilian no speak english and they are absolutely obsessed with selfies i found photography a bit difficult here because brazilians generally will take their selfie and do so for 10 minutes and then freeze in the same spot and upload their photos to instagram     i have never been to the south or the interior of the northeast but i will be back next year its a great country    oh and the best thing about brazil no retard tourists from europe us canada australia you will most likely be the only tourist not from latin america outside of rio bonito lencois maranhenses and chapada diamantina
  how are the crimes usually like down there
just dont hang around screaming im a foreign tourist and you should be ok
  ive actually done that once and have almost gotten fined by the police back in mexico
    it wasnt cool though
  yet some people wont even bother to talk with you if you had only spoken english to them
  never had any issue with crime personally i witnessed it two times in a busy park where i was eating some juice and suddenly there was screaming and shouting because a thief passed by bicycle and robbed a woman of her phone second time was on a boat on the amazon where the lady next to me started crying because her phone was gone     most of the cities have police and are pretty busy during the day so not much chance of anything happening the most dangerous cities in brazil are also the most touristy just remember that a city in brazil might have an exorbitantly high murder rate but in fact 95 of the murders happen in the periphery and two shitty neighborhoods     interior of the country is extremely relaxed felt safer than in european cities     avoiding crime in brazil is pretty easy just avoid the people who look like criminals if you want to know who looks like a criminal in brazil just look at all the violent videos you find on the internet    absolute beginner mode pick a hostel in a trendy bar/restaurant/night club neighborhood only walk on big populated roads with shops and call an uber everywhere its cheap and with that sun and humidity walking is a pain anyway    if you want to blend in as always my recommendation wear some football shirt of an extremely popular club like flamengo and no one will know you are a foreigner unless you open your mouth thats the hard thing about brazil i can hold a conversation in any spanish latin country without them asking me where im from but in brazil that is pretty much impossible
   see you on liveleak
   it wasnt really cool though
   see you all on liveleak

how easy is it to find a passable brazilian tranny that has 21cm dick
  ive been thinking of visiting for about 2 months starting in january  been thinking of using the city of santos as a base and explore the country from there   i speak fluent portuguese although with a european accent    if i go in january i will be there for carnaval not sure if good or bad cause of all the people
  hue
  amazing list bro thanks
  very easy two ways  1 go to lgbt nightclubs all major city has one or if you are corageous and with car  2 go to shemales prostitution zones
  that is the start of high season so prices will be higher than normal and even higher closer to carnival     only 5 of brs speak english you simply have to learn some portuguese or walk around like an idiot
  yeah buddy
any experience of the amazon tips  have a chance to go there with a group in january
    uma delicia
  thanks appreciated to hear that
  i would add florionopolis and foz do iguacu to the list its meme tourist locations but definitely worth to check out if you like nature hikes and clean beaches
  i went for 5 weeks a few months ago and it was a good trip  not one of the great trips  i recommend bonito for wildlife like anteaters and sao paulo for quality food and bars ilha grande for tropical islands  we hired a car and stayed at luxury level mostly and had zero issue with safety or communication

scary golf is the best for tourists
what the fuck is going on with the schizo posting in this thread
  i dont know if it even works or if it has passengers carts maybe its just for cargo
br dude here honestly im always surprised people come visit us our cities are boring as hell if youre not in rio or sao paulo i think what makes br somewhat good for tourists is that tourists come with lots of money to spend and are usually wealthy coming from countries with dollars or euros as its currency thats how you enjoy brazil brazil is not for the poor living in a country that has some beautiful shit in it like fernando de noronha but not being able to use it cause its overpriced as fuck is totally depressing
  the national museum of brazil is aweso    uh never mind    
  its just some bottom anon posting some random photos from either facebook or another thread

  iam a brazilian and i can confirm most of that has been said here rio taken as an exemple is the most touristical place in brazil but one of the most violent in gangrelated crimes 2 of the biggest gangs in brazil dispute the city and it culminated into large military operations  but gang violent should be simple advoiced by not visiting guettos even if they are military occupied  about advoicing people who looks like criminals i suppose your refering to  pic related  the generic brazilian thug focus on the type of glasses haircut and brands they aways preffer fake adidas cyclone and maresia stuff    sorry for my bad english      br media preffers rio and sp its understandable if you only know those 2 cities attractions i would make a small guide based on prefferences but eh
hey /trv/ whats alaska like    i kinda wanna move there love the snow and kinda wanna be somewhere different for a year since im taking some time off uni want to experience something different want new experiences     got a few questions  any good entry level jobs that pay well or decently  any cities or towns you reccomend i stay  any alaska fags with advice  do you guys think there better states i can have this crisis in
  alaskafag here ive got an alaska general going but its slipped down the catalog a bit im at work right now but ill come back and answer some questions in a few hours
  fuck off this has nothing to do with travel why is it always amerifats shitting up this board with their  where in america should i move to  shit    sage and report
  if you want to check out alaska as a newb is to start with a summer seasonal job lots of entry level work and the pay is way above average like ive seen dishwasher jobs posted for 12/hr plus most jobs pay a bonus if you stay on through the whole season usually 12 per hour worked or a percentage of the companys take at the end of the summer plus you get tipped a lot even if youre not in a tipped based jobs most of the tourists come up on cruise ships and just tip reflexively plus you get to go out and work in the great parts of alaska instead of stocking shelves at walmart in shankorage  so if you dont right you can spend your summer in a cool place like skagway or talkeetna and if you dont party too much you can finish the season with a decent chunk of change in your savings which you will want if you stay the winter most of the tourist towns close up for the winter so work options become a lot more limited the only real year round tourist town is girdwood where i live because its the only full ski resort in alaska the resort/hotel is one of the biggest employers in the winter and the jobs arent bad but the housing market is brutal so youll probably wind up in the employee dorm  other than that your best bet is to gravitate towards fairbanks or somewhere adjacent to anchorage like palmer or wasilla but i would not recommend actually living in anchorage
    thanks m8s
  youre welcome i also forgot to mention that if you work in the tourism/hospitality biz for a season you can usually get standby spots on other companies tours for free or very cheap i got to go on a 7 hour glacier cruise in seward for 25 one summer
  if youre still here how much does board cost during the summer did some research and found out some jobs help you with places to stay but how much would i pay on average
  if you go for a company that provides employee housing expect to pay probably 200400/ per month usually just deducted from your paycheck but also expect to have a lot of roommates if youre looking for a place on your own its going to vary a lot from town to town depending on the availability of housing you could pay anywhere from 5001000 a month depending on where you are and what youre renting dry cabins are usually a good cheaper option in a lot of places and some people legitimately just camp all summer most smaller towns have some kind of laundry/shower service available and most towns have a facebook group where housing ads get posted  id say for your first summer up here try and find a job that offers housing even if you only stay there for a month or two it takes a lot of the stress out knowing that you will have a roof over your head when you get there
also expect your employee dorm to have some kind of weird nickname like the fort the meatlockers actual commercial walkins converted to bedrooms campbodia etc   one of my personal favorites is the massive holland america/princess dorm in healy just outside denali np its called the deathstar  its summer camp with way more sex and booze
    thanks man
what is there to see/do in anchorage
  you can take a look at all the bridges that just collapsed after the 72 quake this morning  but in all seriousness not much anchorage is really only good for costco and the airport other than that its a shithole all the cool stuff is outside anchorage
is there much work in the logging/forestry side   really like the idea of moving to bumfuck alaska and living in a cabin
  theres more work in forestry/firefighting than there is in logging but i wouldnt call either a growth industry up here too much old growth was logged in 70s80s during alaskas first big growth spurt and now theres really only pulp logging going on theres a lot fw research/conservation work thatll put you out in the middle of nowhere though
is naples as bad as people say     i would like to see pompeii herculaneum and take the bus up vesuvius and hike to the top additionally there is the archaeology museum in naplesim not sure if theres anything else worthwhile    at any rate im wondering if it would be better for me solo traveler to stay in naples to do all that stuff or in sorrento   is naples bad enough to warrant staying elsewhere
  its bad to the retards coming to italy and expecting every place even massive cities to be like a mountain top village or a venice teir open air museum because they know nothing about the country besides pathetic memes only negative ill give it for a tourist is the trash problem
more contemporary soul to it than any other big tourist italian city if you like history go to rome but if youre looking to get a sense of the real italian life/thinking go naples
  its full of atmosphere no reason whatsoever not to stay there
  i did an italy car trip with my gf in september and naples was the absulote worst experience we had in the whole trip  coffe was nice though  watch your feet so you dont step in human shit 50 metres away from main attractions    but vesuvius and pompeii were cash   probably is better to go to salerno its 20 kms away from vesuvius and was much much much nicer    pic related
  well its poor very large sections of the city look like tenement housing lots of graffiti and a massive trash problem you could go further down towards sorrento but that whole area is just grotesque in terms of tourism the only place ive ever been in europe where multiple waiters reminded me tip not included i have to work in naples/sorrento four times a year
  with my gf  this is 4chan why do you think its appropriate to emphasise this this adds no value to your post
    southern italy is much more similar to mexico than anywhere else in europe so when you go to naples think youre going to mexico city and be on your guard like that     pizza is good tho
i was in naples for 4 days and thought it was fine no safety issues and the people were friendly dirtier than most european cities but if youve been anywhere outside of europe or northern america its nothing major just stay in the historic center and avoid the areas near the airport and main train station and you will not run into any of the problems people mention of the city
    1/2    first of all this anon  is right italy is the biggest group of states in the world you have the united states of america the federative republic of brazil the russian federationbut none of these is as much diverse and fragmented as italy moving from milan to naples is like moving from mars to saturn and its not just because the north and the south are different as everybody knows but because every italian city was in the past a citystate the distance between florence and pisa is 69 kilometres but they have been at war for ages and war doesnt mean a skirmish but actual bloody and furious war same goes for milanvenice venicegenova genovapisa milanflorence florencesiena florencevolterra padovavenice veniceferrara bolognamodena perugiaassisiyou name it     this should be enough for you to understand that certain claims such as to get a sense of the real italian life/thinking go to naples  are bullshit there is not a real italy there is not one italy every region is a different world every city is a singularity of that world if a city doesnt have a strong folkloristic vibe it doesnt mean its less authentic on certain days for example ferrara is silent and motionless like a tombbut thats because its citizens are quiet and suspicious by nature not because they lost their glory all of this to say that you should not pay attention to anyone who judges naples by comparing it to other cities it is indeed a contradictory citypoor but rich in culture and history dirty but colorful heavy but funnyand its people can be either the biggest criminals in the world or the most friendly hosts youll ever meet anyway whether youll like it or not naples is a unique experience and it requires a certain amount of openmindedness you gotta be a fuckin man to enjoy that place
    2/2    im not sure if theres anything else worthwhile  the area of naples is one of the densest in the world in terms of things to see its a concentration of nature islands urbanscapes small towns and history ranging from rome to the present day you could take a ferry to procida ischia and capri you can visit pompeii herculaneum stabia and oplontis you can travel the costiera amalfitana which includes amalfi atrani positano ravello minori vietri sul mare and the amazing furore underrated sorrento and salerno are also beautiful you can and you should climb the vesuvius you could spend a whole day at the archaeological museum of naples one of the most important museums in the world then you have museo dellopera di santa chiara another mustsee museo di capodimonte certosa di san martino and palazzo reale the castles maschio angioino and castel dellovo what about the churches well obviously the basilica of san francesco di paola the gothic santa chiara and cappella sansevero an absolute masterpiece of baroque art you might like a tour of the underground naples and the catacombs and if you like this kind of creepy stuff go on to cimitero delle fontanelle to see the ossuary at the parco vergiliano of piedigrotta you can leave a flower on the graves of virgil and leopardi exiting naples again you can visit the incredible reggia di caserta or the ancient city of capua full of roman ruines finally you may consider driving an hour out to the medieval towns of santa maria de goti and cusano mutri is it enough
  why is naples bad  a ton of reason   trash everywhere   1970s nyc levels of crime like daylight robbery and muggings   22 unemployment so bums and beggars galore   probably the most corrupt city in all of italy    if you go dont walk anywhere at night by yourself take taxis or ride a scooter
  im starting at a hostel in erclano herculaneum right now neighborhood is quiet its super close to the train and the excavation and pompeii isnt too far off and im not staying in naples itself sorrento is a bit pricey and naples is covered in graffiti and seems a bit sketch it was a heck of a shock getting off the bullet train in naples after having spent a few days in rome but i havent felt in danger of being mugged just watch your pockets
    ok mr camorra calm down
  fuck off retard
  kek
  i would like to see pompeii herculaneum and take the bus up vesuvius and hike to the top additionally there is the archaeology museum in naplesim not sure if theres anything else worthwhile  not really naples can be done in 2 days 1 for pompeii and herculaneum and 1 for the museum and eating pizza there is a castle and a palace you can visit but the castle is kind of lame dont go out after night falls
i went to naples last summer went to italy pretty much every summer since i was young naples was kinda of a letdown   we first had an airbnb in a very bad neighbourhood we had to go into a side alley of a side alley of a side alley if anything wouldve happened it wouldve taken us some time to get out  was with my girlfriend so we immediately figured we didnt want to stay there when we arrived some guys immediately started approaching us shit felt really unsafe   once we got to a hotel in some different area it was okay i guess my advice if u go there make sure that your accomodation is in the new part of town the old part is really fun and beautiful to go to during the day but you wouldnt want to be stuck there during midnight the new part is much more modern but still really nice you have this bay area which imo is really great  we only went to pompeii not to the other two places you mention i think i would really have loved to go up to the vesuvius hercalaneum im not sure isnt that pretty much the same as pompeii but then smaller i never went there so im not sure tho
is naples as bad as people say    kinda yet still worthy  with neapoletanean people the border between outgoing/funny and shady/trying to fuck you over is quite thin  people are indeed more open than most of italians and kinda incarnate the stereotype of the outgoing funny italian at the same time everyone is streetsmart aware and kinda of used to scams so scamming people is not seed a big deal  hold your things tights dont trust people more than common sense would suggest dont go into shady areas/ghettoes and things should be fine  the old town is amazing neaples was the capital of the spanish monarchy in italy the whole city is stunning  ercolano is smaller than pompei but way better preserved and way less turistic  if you want to see something awesome check out the casertas reggia it has been used as the naboo royal palace in the star war movies and generallly its the italian version of versaille
  was with my girlfriend  again why is this relevant
  probably in denial over breakingup  only singles and bitter married people on 4chan
      interesting and informative post but i take issue with     italy is the biggest group of states in the world  none of these are as much diverse and fragmented as italy     did you forget that india exists no offense m8not trying to shit on your post im just nitpicking on a single piece of it
  why is dragging a woman around a sketchy area relevant to the story of the sketchy area  fucking autists
  its a bit seedy but check it out
gps took us down backroads and into a downtown area    imagine a country road with rubbish piled up on the side for kilometres    literally saw a naked african prostitute standing in a field off to the side in a pile of rubbish then we got deep into town which was a nightmare of fiats and scooters    10/10 would take our brand new 3 series rental car with german plates in again
discounting the obvious shill in this thread naples is good to visit if you dial down your expectations think more developing world tier ive been going there for work for about a decade now and the first few times i thought it was just squalor especially for a european city now i know what places to go where to avoid the riff raff etc
  tend to seek for safety quicker when with my girlfriend than with a guy friend   why are you so salty when you see someone having a girlfriend
its a beautiful city thats inhabited by human rats thriving in their own physical and moral filth
  its easy to see why italianamericans are so looked down upon theyre all fucking neapolitan
  i doubt it then the napolitan pizza would be the dominant one in the us instead of muh pie
  thissssssssssssssssss    naples is hectic in a good way    do it up op
  you have a double digit iq way to show it
  napoli has the best pizza in the world
  dude naples used as example of anything italian except history and pizza makes me rage
  is pic naples
  nope salerno
06 months  lol at those expats losers cannot even integrate keeping to themselves asocial faggots  612 months  why are they even trying to engage with me cannot they clearly see that i have local friends  1218 months  maybe should have gone to the expat party since the locals forgot to invite me  1824 months  damn i really wish i had some friends why dont these local acquaintances ever want to hang out  2432 months  maybe i should check out one of those expat meets  3238 months  holy shit expats are actually friendly people who want to form real friendships why the fuck didnt i do this from the get go
expats are actually friendly people who want to form real friendships  dont let them fool you they are just as desperate for your attention as you are for theirs    also  integrate  in asia  your doing it wrong
     when youre 30 months in a new country youre no longer an expat youre a goddamn immigrant its always anglo poors who use that word expat as if their lifestyle of teaching esl to chinks is just temporary and they have a cushy suburban life at home to go back to    and yes expats who stay 30 months and still have no local friends are a bunch of faggots and doing it wrong
  fuck expats fucking boomer retards
    pensioned boomers are shitheads but at least theyre genuine expats millennial programmers and esl teachers on the other hand are economic migrants
  haha this      being an expat kind of sucks after the novelty disappears your frustration with local customs just builds over time    i usually ended up with other expats because our budgets matched and often locals live sheltered lives    try to get in with the social elite
  see that a lot with esl teachers in asia i knew an american couple that worked six years on jeju island in sk and didnt pick up even the most basic korean language skills only hung out with other esl teachers no locals at all pretty sad desu on the flip side and much more rare knew a colleague that came over to sk taught his esl classes busted his ass completing an online masters degree in journalism learned the language and culture and now shows up from time to time on cnn international as a reporter in asia
    lol yes its the locals in se asia who have sheltered lives unlike you badass englishteaching migrants staying your migrant bubble
i worked with lots of expats the first time i moved out of my country  i kept on using the word immigrant or migrant when reffering to my status and they tried to oh so helpfully condescendingly correct me saying i was also an expat  back then i didnt use expat cause i wasnt totally sure what it meant while i knew the full definition of immigrant these days i use immigrant just to troll expats i love to troll the fragile egos like dude youve been living 10 years in the same country away from your home and still refuse the immigrant label thats cute    that 3 year mark seems to be relevant for me too i started to feel really lonely at that point after 3 years suddenly locals started inviting me for birthdays and weddings the stuff they would leave me out of in the first years now i feel like a person
  10 years  but thats a rarity i am an expat not an immigrant because i move places but do not stay for longer than a couple of years
  expats are people who dont try or cannot integrate thats how i use it anyway although because of what the op said its more of a personal identity thing rather than fact because integration is often hard/impossible so in practice you are an expat whether you like it or not
  not in that expat circle its lots of people who have been living in the same place for over a decade with no intention of moving away    expat is also fine but like they tried to correct me cause for them expat meant something higher than eg migrant worker we were doing some low level shit jobs it made them feel better to refer to all of us as expats i dont mind either term now i just like to troll people who do
    western millennials doing shitjobs in asia like teaching esl to chink kids are absolutely migrant workers not expats who are just slumming for fun and have a mansion in england waiting for them at home a lot of these western digital hobos arent just economic migrants but also illegal immigrants who do regular visa runs out of the country
  youve been living 10 years in the same country away from your home and still refuse the immigrant label thats cute  youre not an immigrant unless you are working on becoming a citizen until you gain citizenship youre just another loser who can be deported at whim whenever things change    picrelated standard esl teacher
pissed off expat here    went to switzerland  made local friends  started 2 businesses here  swiss are shady af   closed both businesses  fucked many qts    imma bout to yeet the fuck out of here though fuck this place
  expats are people who cant integrate    thats literally just british and americans then were shit at that
  move to a cunt where you earn less  economic migrant  you what
    not him but i think hes referring to the fact that they earn a western wage whilst living cheaply to line their pockets would make them economic migrantsidk
afternoon been to bangkok a couple of 5 time a couple of trips with the boys over and a few trips quickly with the gf between other places flying in and out of bkk 7 days apart     i got plenty of shit i wanna do but any interesting stuff to see and do while there     i plan to have sometime to myself aswell
yea theres tons
hey everyone im thinking of doing some traveling solo soon does anyone have any tips for finding entertainment in foreign places when you know absolutely no one else there
  i do loads of internet research before i go basically so as to be pointed in the right direction
going to hostels really helps if you find a good one you can  spend little money even for a private room  meet people  take tours around for cheap
  hostels  sounds like a great way to get robbed raped and covered in bedbugs
  i traveled only with hostels in the past 7 years and nothing happened to me croatia spain uk bulgaria france italy algeria greece turkey albania
  that just means you were the one doing the raping and robbing
  ive only stayed at 2 hostels i didnt like and they were during extremely busy times
  lol needing to be entertained is for package travelers try and do nothing for once and just meditate
  dont go outside its too dangerous
  why spend the money on travel if thats all you do
  do you mean like looking at what you wanna do when you arrive places to go things to see that sort of thing  that definitely seems like a good place to start but what other tips do you have things i might not expect to be an issue but then suddenly when im there might give me some grief
  nibba is this your first time traveling    i usually look at tripadvisor google reddit and /trv/ for ideas on what to see i also always get a map when i get there from the hostel or the tourist center to see if theres anything that seems cool and that i missed you can also ask the receptionist for some tips    things i might not expect to be an issue but then suddenly when im there might give me some grief  give an example
  dude just go sleep in the open in a filthy room filled with strangers in a foreign country its totally safe
  be well prepared and dont do anything too dangerous i almost got seriously injured once because i lost my grip while walking down a mountain
  good advice from an incel
  literally the first person on this site that ive seen be afraid of hostels lol why are you even here
  foreign country  pathetic afraid and sad
  there are these things called hotels that normal people stay in so they dont have to sleep with one eye open in case the drugged up stranger in the next bed decides to stab them
  but if you are afraid of hostels how are you not afraid of 95 of the world
  if youre afraid of walking through crime ridden ghettos at night how are you not afraid of 95 of the world
  if you are into sports you can check the popular sports of the place you are going to and attend a local match      you are baiting
  how hostels are filled with poor people and poor people commit crime
  hostels are mostly filled with teenagers who are travelling by themselves who want to meet other people and save some money many of them from korea australia and america doing their 5 monthlong european trip aka high class people    all hostels have lockers where you can put your things there are always people around which makes breaking into them quite risky and not worth it since most bags only have dirty socks and underwear    i dont know if you have seen too many movies but most people dont feel like murdering randoms    usually the only junkies in hostels are 420 weed lmao people who wont hurt a fly and are to slow to do anything even if they wanted
  dont
  dude stop feeding him
  i know this is a shitpost but i absolutely love the fact people somehow think that a hotel instantly protects them from getting robbed or bed bugs       do you dress yourself in the morning    holy wow  google area thinking about visiting  research on trip advisor  use other platforms for things to do  use airbnb events for suggestions on things to do
  tfw travel a good bit  stay in hostels so i can meet people and extend length of trip  tell people back home about staying in a hostel  everyone assumes is party 24/7 orgies and eurotrip  showed pictures to my coworkers about some hostels i stayed in japan but called it a capsule hote instead  opinion on them was 360 degrees on them about how those are so cool and neat
  capsule hotels / hostels  if you have privacy its a 180 difference
  most hostels ive been to are capsule like unless im staying in some 10 dollar shit show
  ergo not hostels
  if it has hostel in the name its a hostel anon
  nah outliers do not change common definitions
  hostels arent hostels because i say so    ooookay anon
  ive traveled plenty just not solo thats why im posting here i wanna know what might be different that i wouldnt expect  im just trying to avoid unpleasant surprises
op here let me rephrase this question    from those of you who have traveled solo what were some things that surprised you good or bad  were there any instances where you ran into some stress from being solo or was it smooth sailing  any general tips
  going to eat at restaurants alone can be a bit daunting its better to go in offpeak times ie not on a friday/saturday 79pm go earlier or get fast/street food   but eventually you just stop giving a fuck what people think if your hungry
  as well as the usual tripadvisor/thorntree/bookingcom stuff sometimes i buy tickets to the theatre/concerts often possible toprint them out in advance that sort of thing or if theres anything else thats best prebooked and likewise train or coach tickets to get around whichever country im travelling around and check opening hours and transport access of places i want to see
ill be travelling solo for the first time in july to thailand and maybe one more country on which i havent decided yet thinking i might continue to malaysia  anyway i can tell you one thing thats different when travelling solo its taxi price lol probably eating alone but i dont care about that i am planning to sleep in hostels so i meet some people to go out with if not i might get really bored in the evenings i mean during the day no problem there is a lot of stuff to do but in the evening its nice to have some company
  pretty much just loneliness and experiencing cool moments where you wish you had your best friend from back home or your sibling to share it with    by loneliness i mean that sometimes i cant for the life of me think about much exciting shit to do having someone else there to bounce ideas off of can reveal a lot of cool shit you can do that you either cant do back home or would be more difficult to    as for actually finding entertainment id say     use tinder try to hook up with bitches some might be cool with just hanging out or giving you recommendations   internet research as always   ask receptionists at hotels/hostels   if hostels ask the other people staying if they saw some cool shit theyd recommend   ask at the local tourist office   honestly ask randoms on the street or the waiters/waitresses at cafes youre stopping for lunch in    you may have social anxiety when at home partly due to having to see these people more than once in your daily life there is no such fear when abroad be more open feel more free youll be gone forever in the blink of an eye    im traveling alone myself in a few days ill apply all of this shit and already have a small list of stuff to do to fill my time with contingencies
  to add to the speak to people thing in case you might be stressed about it if youre a tourist in a country especially if you speak a different language every day people will be more inclined to help you because they want you to have a good impression of their country and people nobody wants to hear a tourist say their country is shit and the people are cunts    plus depending on how you ask you might get recommendations for more local stuff like hangout places bars and pubs that wouldnt be common knowledge for foreigners instead of just big famous landmarks you find on travel websites
  eating your big meal at lunchtime is the best way to go with a snack in the evening
  i was never murdered so there are no murderers in the world
  everybody acts like this guy is crazy but on my first solo trip with my first stay at hostels i was robbed at one and got over 200 bites all over my body in another never again  and before anybody tells me this can happen anywhereyoure wrong i always check my bed the bugs came from the guy above me and his bag motherfucker had one bite after leaving that hostel i had trouble finding another because they noticed the bites on my neck and arms and fucking ear only one ear was overinflated i looked retarded they wouldnt let me in anywhere had to finally pay for a hotel
hey same boat ive traveled a bunch with friends and wed always have a policy of being independent ie being able to do an activity without other travel peers participating reduces arguments about trying to force everyone to do something    now my my most prominent travel buddy is more apt to travel with fiance i have no qualms with that nor do i want to be a 3rd wheel    now im making an impromptu trip to amsterdam in the coming months due to stress from work made a rash decision to request holiday time and booked a place and plane like i know what i want to do museums food whoring but doing all that by myself seems daunting to me how do i get over it its weird because when i do with friends on some days we all go off on our own tangent and i was okay with that    traveling alone just seems so daunting how do i prepare mentally i want to travel more too and i chose amsterdam as a safe place to acclimatize to solo traveling as stupid as it sounds
  i bring a pair of gymnastic rings with me and a chromebook i write and i train good enough
  from those of you who have traveled solo what were some things that surprised you     how incredibly easy it is so socialize with locals compared to traveling in a group or with another person seriously i traveled abroad solo my first time last year and picking up women partying with others and getting cool experiences was way way easier the amount of money i saved was night and day as well traveling with a buddy often can mean more money spent on booze stopping more for snacks and other stuff    were there any instances where you ran into some stress from being solo or was it smooth sailing  smooth sailing but i am kind of an independent person who is very sociable one thing is though that you need to have a back up plan to get to funds when you are solo you can fail harder than if you have a buddy who can cover you
  and before anybody tells me this can happen anywhereyoure wrong  it can though airports actually have shut down wings due to bed bug infestations and hotels next to airports are super likely to have them via the amount of traffic nothing really is full proof against bed bugs anon     
the only way i travel anymore is solo while meeting up with people at specific places or events its just too much luggage that i am willing to deal with after traveling in groups for some time   tfw  never have to wonder who has the key cards or what not into the room  dont have to piss away time wondering where or what to eat  never have to drag my friends ass back to the hotel and make sure he sleeps in the tub  ensure they get up and packed before checkout time  dont have to make sure their flight shit is all good  never have to worry about their finances shit  easier to hook up with locals both sexually and causally   never worry about coming back too late or them waking me up early or whatever  dont have to sit around and wait for their slow ass  can do more spur of the moment things
hey /trv/    i took a gamble and quit my job without one to go to so finish at my current place tomorrow fortunately i got offered another job today so the move has paid off    i come to you because i now have all of december and the first week of january to occupy myself    im seeing my family in the new year anyway so probably wont head home for that    if im being sensible i can afford to spend 23k going somewhere    sea obviously sprang to mind can get a flight from london to bkk for about 450 tomorrow night if i want    what would you do if you had that budget and a month or so    looking for  relaxation  landscapes  good food  some drinking but more focused on healthy living  adventure  nature  seeing fewer british people    oh yeah i can drive too if my budget allows
  sea obviously sprang to mind  seeing fewer british people  what did he mean by this
  obviously there are lots of british people at the resorts but they tend not to be very adventurous so you dont tend to have to go far before you seldom see one
  fewer brits in thailand than in bongistan thats for sure although the ones in thailand are a lot more likely to be chavs
  seeing fewer british people    may as well goto iraw
pretty easy to go to thailand and barely even see any white people let alone brits obviously not if youre booking package holidays but if you plan things yourself like hopefully everyone on /trv/ does then its a myth that theres no real thailand left
how many languages do you speak and what languages are they what tips can you offer to those learning a language
dutch  english  portuguese br  french  just do an hour every day if you can afford it get a teacher for 2 times a week to ask question and guide you trough  if possible go to the country to learn it  even better if the people arent able to speak english latin america for spanish  português  in europe and north america everyone switches to english because this is a bigger focus in their education
what does this random chicks photo have to do with languages or travel

  polish english and spanish    im still learning spanish though im nearly fluent now after i get to a level i want to get to in spanish im going to start a lifetime project of learning mandarin i think that will balance out my language abilities quite well at that point      you need to use different sources of learning and the way to learn languages is just spending time on them at least 1 hour a day but if you can do more play learning games in your mind while doing other mundane tasks i study at work because during the 8 hours im at my desk i have maybe 3 hours of work taking a bus to work/school download some mp3s of language lessons and play them on the way or print a list of verbs and start memorizing over and over until you remember them all    duolingo is super basic you need to invest in other learning sources the best motivation is paying for a course because then you have money invested in it and theres usually a schedule of learning things which guides and motivates you along if you cant afford that pirate a few spanish language textbooks torrent rosetta stone and use any other source you come across to start learning once you get to knowing enough to have basic conversations look online for people to talk to either via skype or in person locally
  dutch  english  german  japanese  chinese cantonese    dont bother with school instead do 1 hour a day grinding through vocabulary grammar and watching media in whatever language you are trying to learn you should have a firm grip on the language within 2 years and be native level within 5
  where did you start with japanese   watching media in whatever language you are trying to learn  this is actually very effective ive been consuming korean media/culture for like 9 years and have picked up a ton of shit just from that it was all very passive too i wish i had been actively trying to learn all those years cause by now id probably be fluent
  yeah because theyre lazy cunts lol
  i started by learning the writing system of katakana and hiragana and then using books to learn the grammarvocabulary and kanji of the japanese language    this al combined with a healthy consumption of japanese media daily for 12 hours led me to being able to converse in the language comfortably within 2 years and being able to read novels in japanese its now 6 years ago and japanese people now think im a haafu that was raised in japan due to my fluency when they hear me speak    the switch to cantonese was pretty easy as the kanji was basically transferable between japanese and cantonese and the grammar is a mix of english and japanese grammar rules this combined with the fact that quite a lot of vocabulary is shared with japanese meant that learning cantonese from japanese was just as easy as learning german from dutch very close languages    honestly if you are interested in korean then go for it dont bother with learning useful languages its bullshit and youll never master them ive had forced french lessons for 6 years and i speak 0 french now because being forced to learn something means jack shit
  honestly if you are interested in korean then go for it dont bother with learning useful languages its bullshit and youll never master them ive had forced french lessons for 6 years and i speak 0 french now because being forced to learn something means jack shit  im sort of at a crossroads between learning korean and japanese not sure which i wanna go with i like both of them a lot   but i agree you need interest in the language to learn it im learning german and it simply isnt too interesting to me if i was more interested id be a lot further on by now i feel like i have a decent understanding and want to continue though but my whole reason for learning is to read german literature in original german but i see now you need more than one point of interest for a language dont care about german for much other than that
i am a monolingual burger and i want to learn russian mostly because its the only european city ive visited where english proficiency is minimal but also because i think it would be neat seeing some of the smaller cities of russia which i would need to know russian to do any tips on learning the language besides what  said i do not have anyone stateside who i can actually practice russian with so i would be limited in practicing my speaking
  i do not have anyone stateside who i can actually practice russian with so i would be limited in practicing my speaking  it would be so easy to find people to practice with on skype through
  not that anon but how can you find people on skype to practice with
  google conversation exchange or something like that or go on /r/languagelearning and check the suggested subreddits there are probably hundreds or thousands of russians willing to talk to you to practise their english
  they want to practice their english  you want to practice your russian    there is a problem
english serbian italian    ive studied japanese for about 6 months this year learned about 1500 words learning kanji through vocab as opposed to in isolation and was reading nhk news easy with a dictionary started my masters program and have dropped it for the past 3 months shit sucks but i did my anki cards the other day and have retained almost everything and i didnt get too far in terms of grammar so i can pick up where i left off just have to do it my goal is to be able to read some ok manga in a year and be conversational in 2
im at that point where i have quite a decent foundation of spanish down but i have hit a plateau and dont know what i can use to improve at the moment i use duolingo watch netflix in spanish with spanish subtitles use hellotalk and my phone is in spanish and immerse my self in some of it everyday but i need something elseany tips appreciated
  move to a spanish speaking country youll see how quickly youll start to pick up if youre completely surrounded by it
english french and spanish  english is pretty much mandatory where i live so that was a given and i learnt french because i liked it id like to learn another language
english native  intermediate french  beginner german    there is really no point in learning any language other than english for travel just not worth the effort even in countries like france or japan where english skills are pitiful    for business or if you plan to emigrate sure or if youre just passionate about language learning but for travel its just not worth it
  duolingo is fucking trash use anki
    i will be in 12 months but until then i want to do the best i can to learn
  not op but id like to study with her anon
korean native speaker  japanese grandmother is japanese  english moved to a country that speaks it  french learned it on the side    i find that its easier to learn when youre using it in everyday conversation i speak three of my languages at least adequately because i use them when speaking to friends family or at work french is my weakest language because i only learned the basics in school and i have had very few opportunities to speak it outside of a school setting
russian native  english c2 by efset but i feel that this test is bs actually im closer to c1  french it was the primary foreign language in school probably around b1 now since i forgot a lot  japanese meh tier n5 at best      currently grinding anki kanjivocab while trying to read news on nhk easy and shitposts on /int/ and 5ch    psst hey dude want some practice
  drop duolingo it does more harm than good use anki decks like the other person said
  start learning kanji in isolation look up the heisig method its been proven that people that master the 2500 kanji first and only then start learning grammarvocab reach n1 in the least amount of time
  its been proven that people that master the 2500 kanji first and only then start learning grammarvocab reach n1 in the least amount of time  you dont master anything with rtk though youre not actually learning the kanji also id challenge the its been proven notion by who has it been proven
    can someone explain how anki works do i just load my own words in as a i go or is there some preloaded ones
  you can do both if youre the guy doing spanish you should be able to find some premade decks pretty easily you can start with a premade deck that has the x number of most basic words in the language or you can mine new words meaning when you are reading something and come across a new word you add it to your deck
  drop duolingo it does more harm than good  not who youre replying to but ive been considering this i think its better at teaching phrases than the actual fundamentals of the language and even then im not opposed to learning phrases but i just wish they would teach more realistic phrases    i would be perfectly content with stuff like  how much is this  where is the bathroom  can i get directions to location  and so on    instead it teaches really weird phrases that are very unrealistic for a tourist to say such as  this is not my pencil  where is the motor  tim works at the circus    i think its time to drop duolingo
english
  whats the point of learning phrases like that i dont get it if you dont know the words in the sentence then youre just learning a script and if you do then you can just create them in your mind oh actually youre probably just learning it to get by when you travel that would make sense
  english french and spanish  im on the same boat and i feel kinda done ill prob start studying dutch hardcore anytime soon to be able to talk to my wife her english is damn terrible but aside from that those 3 languages will have you covered pretty much everywhere and the amount of godtier literature written in them is overwhelming
    these are the 3 languages id love to have fluency in english is my native though obviously how long did it take to get fluent in french and spanish and how    also i couldnt imagine not being able to communicate with my gf or wife to that extent
french b2 english native spanish c1 guarani/ portuguese a2     i learned them all over the age of twenty i study a couple hours a day and force myself to speak it with everyone recount stories in your head in the target language italki is a great resource too     best advice get a gf that speaks target language my spanish went from b1c1 in a couple months and my french a2b2 as well
  spanish and catalan native  english c2  german b1     as far as tips go everybodys learning style is different for instance i could never be arsed with flashcards and spaced repetition programs anki and such and got my vocabulary from reading instead as long as you put in the hours you are gonna get better unless your method is complete trash duolingo learning a language is always a longdistance race so keeping motivated and having a realistic goal as well as looking back on your progress are big parts of success personally i find interactions with natives very rewarding and that keeps me pushing however others may find that in being able to understand a book or a movie or even in reaching academic standards and earning an official certificate

german native  english  french  spanish  chinese currently learning    heres how you learn a language   learn the very basics the old fashioned way basic grammar the basic words you need etc this exists only so you can start actually learning the language   once you understand the basics you can start watching movies/ tv series etc in the language you learn with subtitles  then take away the subtitles speak with natives videogames are an option here read books in the language you want to learn   if you can afford it go into the country intsef if you cant speak the language well but the basics should be something you know at least rasonably well youll learn it fast    for the first step anki is amazing and free flashcards do their job well    tldrl dont learn like you learn in school learn passively via podcasts video and books

  how long did it take to get fluent in french and spanish and how  im a spaniard who attended boarding british schools his entire life yes my parents didnt want me around regarding french i took one semester in college didnt learn shit but it sparked my interest and i studied it on my own two hours a day for a year got me a b2  spanish and french are very similar and once youve mastered one the remaining one will be a piece of cake start with spanish though and dont pick up la belle langue until youre a strong b2/c1 in spanish otherwise youll get confused and end up speaking an unintelligible mess  learning time depends entirely on your motivation time youre willing to put in and ability to absorb the language if i were you id go to class for a year get the basics covered spanish got many many tenses once youve got that its only vocabulary and hard work on your own
  kekked i dunno i guess she cant be bothered to speak it she doesnt really like the language shes fluent in german though
  english   german  some spanish  can read latin but i dont speak it  the most important thing is interest in the language without that its useless to learn it  if you have that just go learn basic vocab and grammer and then watch/read media in the language and to practice by talking and lsitening     but shouldnt this be on /int

    shes probably not dutch retard dutch people speak english at university and work she would literally never have attended school or work a single job in her life for her not to speak english    its probably a german girl living on the border with the netherlands that picked up some dutch either that or she is homeschooled from the dutch bible belt in some sort of cult which is actually pretty prevalent at the german border
  english spanish and portuguese currently learning french    french is pure suffering 
im only fluent in english     im taking universitylevel hindi courses and feel ive made a lot of progress in the last few months going to india in two weeks and then again in summer part of my doctoral research is focused there so i imagine ill have lots of practice in the coming years     at some point maybe in 2020 id like to take a motorbike trip from the northern us to either panama or argentina i want to study spanish independently at home and then make my first long stop in mexico city figure i can take classes for maybe two months there and then use that as a stepping stone for moving further south     im an anthropology grad student yes i realize ill probably spend most of my life as a poorfag fighting over the 10 tenure track jobs that open each year and am primarily interest in south asia latin america is a close second though id love to be at least conversationally proficient in both hindi and spanish     if anybody has any suggestions on how i can improve my spanish in the meantime thatd be cool ive been watching netflix shows with spanish subtitles plus narcos and shit the grammar seems a lot easier than hindii dont recognize a lot of spanish words but i can usually recognize sentence constructions
english and french i plan on learning korean/chinese considering i might want to do tesl after i graduate
    if youre just looking to learn phrases then use a phrase book desu     duolingo is fine for learning vocab and sentence structure i dont understand all the hate youll never become fluent from using it solely but its a decent tool     language learning isnt just memorizing a bunch of phrases
  thank you for enlightening me about my wifes nationality get off your high horse and refrain from signalling everyone youre a conceited doubledigit iq how fucking retarded are you mate are you operating on mushrooms again
  just english have had abortive attempts to learn german and czech and so i can pick out some very basic words written down but thats about it really only handy for helping me figure out what language it is so i can plug it into google translator     am interested in learning norwegian since it seems to be a 3 for 1 kind of deal with languages and im currently planning a trip there for next year not sure how to start barring duolingo since classes for it dont seem to be in demand in my country
isnt german kind of frustrating to learn though because of all the different dialects    for example i know spanish and the great thing about spanish is that its pretty understandable everywhere across the hispanosphere if you know one dialect you might have to adjust to different accents and the unique local slang of every respective nation but its still mutually intelligible     ive heard the opposite is true with learning german bavarians have trouble understanding people from other parts of germany austrian german is significantly different and swiss german is like a different language altogether i cant imagine how discouraging it must be nonnative german speakers
  french  english  japanese read write perfectly speak like an extremely formal child  german speak but cant read or write
  every german can speak generic german if they need to if they dont then its about a stupid sense of regional patriotism which only stupid cunts would do you shouldnt even waste time on    also this is the case for every old nation with old languages the americas only speak the languages for a couple of centuries while in europe its been thousands or even tens of thousands of years    move into obscure irish and scottish towns and you would also never understand what the hell they were saying    move into rural netherlands and dutch people wouldnt know what they were saying    move into rural france and french people wouldnt know what they were saying this continues on even in spain and other european countries its just that spanish is almost universal except brazil in south america so that is why you have this impression of spanish compared to german but its not entirely correct
  hochdeutsch exists
  not really just learn high german and youre pretty much set go for bavarian if you want to lock down a bigbreasted helga tho
    german  english  french    want to learn  russian   italian
polish  english  norwegian    want to learn  korean  spanish
  move into rural france and french people wouldnt know what they were saying    not true even the most rural french speakers of the most remote regions can be understood the only exception is rural quebeckers but its nowhere near as hard as say a german trying to understand swiss germans
  german is an older language than french
i became fluent in spanish over the course of about a year doing the following      bought fluenz did one lesson erry day after one month got pimsleur and listened once a day erry day  after finishing those got a 45 kindle installed spanishenglish dictionary becomes greatest tool for reading spanish as you just tap on a word you dont know for instatranslation and then watch spanish tv      ive gone to mexico and colombia and communicated just fine consistency is key you dont learn a foreign language by doing some app whenever you have some downtime you learn it by spending xyz amount of time on a progressive program ie a textbook every single day
    replying to myself since im now in front of a keyboard rather than tapping on my phone i want to clarify and broaden how language learning works      human brains are designed to learn languages audibly  to hear it and then repeat it by applying the word in context you need to fit that aspect into your learning program or youll never succeed  thats why duolingo doesnt work on its own     likewise heres another redpill  rosetta stone is just a wellmarketed flashcard game thats not a bad thing in of itself  for vocab building it can be a great resource but it wont help you become fluent    when i was in high school i took german only later did i come to realize everybody in germany knows english only a slight exaggeration so now a decade or so out of high school im 30 i made the decision to become fluent in spanish  for a variety of reasons interest in traveling through latin america living in texas and being able to negotiate with costa rican and colombian hookers so as i mentioned in my post above im now fluent in spanish and thats not falling into the dunningkrueger effect ive tested at the c1 level howd i get there    1 i torrented an old version of fluenz a lessonbased program it teaches you actual lessons on the rule with a video instructor holding your hand the whole way i was so impressed with it that i bought the revised and reshot hd version from the company for both programs i did one lesson a day every day it was almost like a game to figure out where i could squeeze the time in to do a lesson theyre only 30 min long though
    2 remember that audible component that i said was allimportant i then torrented pimsleur spanish 15 and would listen to one lesson each day sometimes once in the morning drive to work and then the same lesson on the drive home the goal shouldnt be to breeze through them its important to do only one per day i started this after completing the first level of fluenz because then id have a better visualization of how the words were spelled as i was hearing them    3 once i completed those i would download spanishlanguage magazine pdfs and watch spanish youtube vids look up extra tv series its a show intentionally spoken in slow spanish i loaded my kindle with spanish language books and could simply tap an unknown word to get it instatranslated    4 downtime bullshit this is where duolingo clozemaster asimili mango and the rest belong i tried out fluentu and yabla but those didnt work too well ultimately you need structure and clear signs of progression and those didnt really add much     5 watch as much spanish tv with spanish subtitles not english subtitles as possible i did meetups and took a 90 community college night class on spanish as well just to practice speaking    as a side note i havent found much benefit to languagespecific podcasts tried spanishpod101 and it didnt take but i got a lot of insight from language learning podcasts like actual fluency the fluent show and i will teach you a language    again  my key point you will never learn a language by inconsistently fiddling with an app when a 10min opportunity presents itself you have to dedicate a set amount of time each and every day under some kind of structured method in order to achieve fluency
does anybody know if the current rioting in paris is affecting transit at cdg and to it such as the rer b
i dont know about cdg but i havent heard anything about it being blocked    rer b is fine
  so there should be no issues getting to gare du nord
    yes should be fine
i commute north of paris it was only blocked once a week ago that being said you should use rer b anyway
land in paris on the 30th of december anything i should see this time of year     no need to make a new thread
people who packed their bags and went travelled to somewhere far/travelled for a long time how are you now
cambodia 5 years took me about 2 years of being back in the states to pull my shit together get over all my addictions and to readjust to what was normal and appropriate i hated it at times absolutely no regrets at all it was how things were supposed to work out make 50k a year now breaking my neck and within 35 years i should be up to 120k thats more success than i was told id have if i traveled dont listen to the bs do it
peace corps for 27 months in mozambique took about the same time to readjust as above anon said i felt a strange mix of patriotism and disgust returning to the us patriotism for the fact that our infrastructure and work culture is light years ahead of africa and disgust for how much we take it for granted and how caught up people are in frivolous horseshit all in all it gave me a much deeper perspective on american life and life in general i regret absolutely none of it a few years outside the corporate ladder will have little to no adverse effect and without that removal and perspective youll miss out on so much you cant gain it reading books or doing research you need to be on the ground and it needs to be a good length of time for the transformation to take place
  you went to cambodia 
  indeed i did where are you thinking about going      man is mozambique as beautiful as i picture it in my mind thats one place that i really want to go but dont think ill ever go because i think being murdered is a real possibility there how did you like it
  tell us some crazy stories this sounds interresting what were the most hard times
moved to taiwan for a job six years ago staying in taiwan because my health declined and i will never be able to get affordable health insurance in the us ever again its us300 per year here for my insurance in the us based on costs when i left and on the amazing increase in costs thanks to obamacare it would be roughly 20000 per year now just for a shitty highdeductible policy it literally costs less than that to live here in taiwan for the entire year  rent food utility bills insurance transportation miscellaneous other crap    with that said the medical system here is complete shit and the doctors are universally incompetent a pharmacist nearly killed me last month by giving me a drug i specifically told her i was fatally allergic to her excuse was but its the only one we had in stock picrelated my face when the packaging didnt list the ingredients either fucking good thing i looked it up online before taking the first pill but its sufficient for any emergencies such as a car accident and i can buy my own medications and manage my own healthcare and fly to thailand when i need something serious done so thats still better than getting no treatment at all in the us      nice image whats it from
   opnice image whats it from    im not op but a little sleuthing turns up that it is cover art by john harris for a british edition of fred pohls novel jem
  i packed my bags and moved to australia 2 years later i traveled around the whole country lived in 2 states and had the ability to visit a bunch of the countries nearby    unfortunately i had to come back and now im not doing too well mentally as my life has stagnated back home im currently preparing to write a grad entrance exam and will attempt getting into a masters program next year if i fail at this i have a backup plan of traveling around asia for a while before settling down somewhere taiwan has my interest to teach english for a few years while learning mandarin either way my goal is to move abroad again the masters degree i want to do is 2 years long 1 of which is in a second university either in europe or australia
i left australian two years ago and ive been doing a poorly planned works trip    really i cant stomach going back home but in two years im not sure what else to do since i never went to uni  ive been working odd jobs but i need to start a career and english jobs arent for me
  i got a job working on cruise ships and other than 9 days of home between eurotrip and my 4th contract i have been constantly on the move for 18 months    im looking forward to sitting still in one place for a few months planning on moving in spain im starting to get sick of the toxic culture here nothing is permanent whether it be friends coworkers romantic interests location on the globe its hard to grow as a person here after awhile    problem is i cant afford to travel unless i keep working on ships or go to school in a couple years ill take a hit and go back although i dont plan to go home anytime soon ever
  this is awesome      but i need to start a career and english jobs arent for me    
  how did you find the cruise ship job
  i dunno i will do it soon
  did    still doing it i have my sanity only because i have a single cabin and we are currently in melanesia heading to new zealand i work in entertainment so i have more leeway in regards to what contract i pick and right now im trying to swing a contract hat starts in the med and ends in south africa i plan to spend a couple months there before i jump back on again    it takes a certain personality but if you do it the right way its an okay way to get paid to see places still gotta travel in your own time cuz you hardly spend nights anywhere
  oh i finally got what you meant by find    my first agent posted on craigslist my second agent i was recommended by a friend

  i was looking at cruise work but the salaries arent that attractive for land based jobs let alone sea based jobs    seems like they employ third world staffwho id be living with aboard    ive done hotel work abroad and it was ok i liked the environment   but at sea id be locked in and starting salaries hardly encourage me to make that commitment    is it really worth it
  look up luca oleastri
  my first agent posted on craigslist  wtf
  moved to spain from the us for work ten years ago here i am married with a ten year old wouldnt change it for the world
  that sounds really nice what do you do for income i wont judge im legitimately curious
  short answer no    the only ones positions who get away with good entry level salaries are the entertainment staff because they want people from us/uk its possible to have a hotel/tourism based career and then find a way to transfer those skills on board cruise consultant executive concierge but that is probably not worth the effort    living with third worlders aint so bad though its literally the united nations of pussy russian bar staff serbian waitresses thai masseuses south african boutique workers take your pick      moved to spain ten years ago  have ten year old     how did that happen
  i think that thats still illegal there brotha  interpol roll out
  i studied here when i was younger fell in love with the culture food etc i work in international ed consulting been in study abroad for three decades now im in my 50s get to fly a lot have three residences in three countries ive never earned big bucks just lots of work for the first fifteen years now work about 15 hours/week love being able to walk the kid to school every day long lunches with the family it gets better especially if you have a set goal and dont drift through life
this might be considered short term for this topic moved to hokkaido 2 years ago to teach english  26 y/o  been some great times been some bad times currently in the latter drinking too much struggling to keep my head screwed on  i dont think id do things differently if given the chance im considering staying here another year but only if i can renegotiate my contract for less working hours  it might sound fucking stupid but my dream is to have the energy to eat a great diet go to the gym for 2 hours everyday and study japanese moreso than im doing now whether that will happen or not is up to my boss   its easy to score here but its hard to score with the girls you really want to score with and even harder to meet one who speaks good english or isnt going to move to tokyo soon  had an amazing girlfriend here who ended things a few months ago beautiful sexy very intelligent bit nerdy fun and a real go getter was difficult but life goes on ive been with enough girls here now to take a break all i want is the time and energy to focus on myself physically and mentally  if my boss declines my proposal then will probably try out thailand or taiwan not sure which one yet but i sure as hell dont want to move back to the uk
  to teach english  how did you find it overall i heard its terrible   a lot of the people i know in tokyo who were english teachers eventually went into modelling
  i guess im in the minority of teachers who dont detest what they do i actually find the teaching part of the job fun many due to my small class sizes how im given free reign to do my own lesson plans and the fact that no ones looking over my back the whole time i like all my students too  what i loathe is that 40 of the day is designated prep time with the style of classes i teach it takes me 10 mins to prepare so the rest of the 3 hours im sat there twiddling my thumbs its a total waste of time time i would love to be at the gym or studying japanese with an actual tutor but unproductive long hours seems core to the japanese work ethic maybe the reason why there are so many suicides here and people look absolutely miserable on the trains    i wouldnt mind staying in tokyo but am slightly put off by how busy and crowded it is
  so the rest of the 3 hours im sat there twiddling my thumbs  i can personally find ways to fill that gap but i dont know the situation tbh it sounds comfy     i wouldnt mind staying in tokyo but am slightly put off by how busy and crowded it is    ive only ever really known tokyo and the surrounding area so i dont know the hokkaido way of things but the overcrowding only gets bad during holidays etc its not that bad really i think youd like it  i got apporached to do teahcing in tokyo but i dont think id enjoy it or find it but i dont know private tutoring would be better if i did it but you kind of need to know the language well enough and get a lot of bookings which includes setting up your own business in a way    how long do you have left there
  also what is the lesson structure like are you given a lot of independence 
bump
ive been studying abroad since i was 18 im 23 now finishing up my masters i guess it isnt really in the same vein as what op is talking about but regardless i can still confirm that just moving away doesnt solve any of your mental issues at least i can say i was 18 when i was stupid enough to think that but if you have graduated college and dont realize you cant outrun your bullshit youre in for a hell of a time when you end up in rural japan or vietnam teaching english with 0 friends
what are the best places in europe to get away from people and spend time in nature    i got myself a eurail pass for the next month and id like to detox from spending a semester in london too populated too noisy too urban    ill be visiting a few cities amsterdam rome vienna but id also like to get away from it all    do you have any recommendations    i dont mind some snow or the cold im used to it
if it were summer scandinavia would be the obvious answer
ok so i have to preface this by saying that im not a bold traveler and i never lived/traveled in a country were there are nogo zones or where you would think twice about going anywhere on your own at night  so maybe germany is not a warzone but to me it might still feel dangerous/violent  so on the one hand you have terrorist attacks on the other hand you have racists and neonazis and i am a target for both so im worried  i went down the rabbit hole and now i cannot stop reading accounts of violence that i never knew about at this point i dont even care about racism desu unless its physical and violent   my intention was to spend 2 years in germany learn c2 german during this summer and then do a masters at some university  im probably going to stay in some west german student town for the whole duration of my stay  am i worrying too much will i be safe or will i have to watch my back all the time
    just stay in america you basement dwelling retard
  learn c2 german  dude thats the level higher educated native speakers generally have you should aim for b1 instead maybe b2 if you study the language very intensely depending on how much knowledge of the language you already have
  please stay away its not safe here
  why go to germany when you can stay in idaho creating rare pepes much safer      this
  am i worrying too much  yes    so on the one hand you have terrorist attacks  how many so far how many died in total compare it to the number of people dying in car accidents per day     you have racists and neonazis  in my 27 years in germany i never saw one single neonazi and nether met any racist not sure who is telling you those stories are you talking about the afd they might be patriotic some may be nationalists or even somehow racist however they are the last people you need to be afraid of     just dont walk around after midnight in the middle of berlin bothering some thugs there thats probably your only danger     move to munich or another beautiful town and you will be fine germany is one of the safest places on this planet though that might change within the next decades so hurry up
american education everyone
  what is that
its not safe to leave your basement better continue to stay there
  compare a non relevant death toll to a growing problem  how very cash money of you
  still not a significant number
  how does risk assessment work  maybe you should try to be a brighter person hanging out in libraries actually has benefits
  in my experience german public libraries have very limited english literature available the library in my town has almost no classics and only emptyheaded crime/thriller novels in english
  ill try to be a help because recently even decent people on here have gotten so afraid of /pol/ that they dispense shitty hostile advice to even people whore legitimately worried shooting the point of the board in the foot    the main worry is not terrorism but street crime terrorism is so laughably overblown by modern media that you forget that usually only a few people are wounded in european cases and media panic almost always creates exaggeration if not outright bogus news stories  street crime however is linked to recent immigration surges which its seen as racist in germany to criticize a lot of these people are from countries where banditry is still a life choice and when given the chance to make big money the easy way in a country that cant legally lop off your head and parade your body around your home village while your parents stand there terrified many do  but even this tends to stop at muggings theres simply no reason to beat you because most people arent sadists not even ahmed whos grown up in a society where either you kill that old farmer and steal his goats or your family starves    tldr  there is crime  theres a relatively small amount of it  if you let go of your wallet you likely wont get beaten  the best countermeasure is to not intentionally be stupid and walk into a residential complex you know nothing about  the most dangerous time isnt night  its prenoon where people are working or at school but all the junkies and criminals are still at home  honestly most crime is scams and avoiding those is a matter of noticing when random strangers are too pushy  the racists are pressured so hard by the police theyre toothless and without real criminal contacts the media are trying to make them look like death squads while theyre in reality just bavarian incels
  german public libraries  but that anon isnt german anon and improving a shitty iq is a long term project
  legitimately worried  there is no legitimate worry its germany ffs there are about 2030 countries in the world that are equally safe where violent crime is likely to never affect you just about all of these countries are in europe if you are european you know this if you are not from europe your home country is worse ie man up
  though that might change within the next decades so hurry up    why might it change
  and you tell people why its not a legitimate worry and what things there are to worry about  theres no such thing as a country where theres absolutely nothing ever to worry about either so just saying man up wont help itll just make these people more convinced that you need to man up to go outside in these places
  so just saying man up wont help  i am not here to help anyone    itll just make these people more convinced that you need to man up  these people  these people can live and die over there in yanquistan for all i care we dont need them here obese plebbies
  in my 27 years in germany i never saw one single neonazi and nether met any racist  germany is one of the safest places on this planet though that might change within the next decades so hurry up
  there is no legitimate worry its germany ffs  lol be nonwhite and move to eastern germany and then tell me that there is nothing to worry about because germany is a developed first world country germans have a problem acknowledging problems with their country one of those growing problems is the neonazis the situation is already out of control and still they are in denial   also racism is fairly common elsewhere and much much more prevalent than in the us but that is the nonviolent kind  unfortunately progressive germans which are still the majority think that if foreigners talk about these issues they are attacking them they feel insulted that foreigners mention these issues because they arent racist but they feel like they are being grouped in with the racists this is an unfortunate misunderstanding none the less there are lots of problems for nonwhites in germany
  be nonwhite and move to eastern germany   oh look i added a qualifier    considering ops pic i doubt he is non white yes rural brandenburg could be an issue for somebody brown but nobody goes there anyway even the locals cant wait to get the fuck out
  and if you never help any of them theyll just stay convinced that theyre right and everyone outside of the us is a hostile elitist psycho  to complain about a problem without being a hypocrite you at least have to try to fix the problem when the opportunity is dropped in front of you  youre the bully who humiliates the bullied kid every time he tries to make friends with anyone and then asks with genuine bafflement well he could just not be lame
  i want to mollycoddle people that are scared of going to one of the safest countries on the planet    there is a limit to how much one can cater to retards without moving into the arena of retardation oneself besides it is doubtful that the op is serious he is probably you anyway
  wed 31 oct 2018 0908 gmt     yeah shit is totally normal guyz nothing to see here
  look at my selection bias    oh norwegian lapland here i thought it was the one place i could feel safe  
  more than 4000 attacks on foreigners have occurred since 2015 some with molotov cocktails  totally normal not at all a cause for concern why are these foreigners even asking these questions germany is a developed first world country france and us is worst it isnt btw
  you have a problem on your hands whatever happens in norway is of no consequence in normal countries there is also racism but not the kind you have in east germany that is on another level not even the american south is that bad
  not even the american south is that bad  citation needed also trump
germany wont exist in 30 years
  t john titor
  serious question is the guy taking the picture considered white enough to be german or not
c2 german  learning to c2 is almost impossible in any language and not necessary at all you dont need to pass b2
  nah he looks not german not yet at least
  interesting how the article fails to mention what caused the demonstrations in chemnitz    how long did you live in east germany
  a brown german immigrant got into a fight an iraqi and a syrian and got stabbed and killed all of the people involved were lowlifes the victim was part of a hooligan club and very likely had ties to neonazi groups this is the reason for the massive protests the attackers were clearly no better   none of this justifies the massive protests and the violent attacks against random brown people there was an incident were a couple of neonazi rang a bell and when the mother opened they started beating her with bats and the husband tried to protect her and got beaten up too and the children as well in the end the mother and the kids ended up in hospital how is that at all justified
  the situation in germany is rapidly deteriorating id recommend switzerland instead
  youre crazy  look armed robbery watches stolen in switzerland      also trains are killing people there      1500 rounds of ammo stolen from swiss army       oy vey i see a pattern here best stay at home
  fuck off were full we dont want your useless 56 ass here
  man the world is an unsafe place the only way to stay safe is to remain in your basement oh wait    
  its also affecting innocent children in basements where can a paranoid schizophrenic find solace  
ah of course this thread is full of afd supporters and racist germanamerifats    with the 4chan/4channel split i had hoped the racism global rule wouldve been better enforced      serious question is the guy taking the picture considered white enough to be german or not  being white has nothing to do with german identity if youre a citizen you are german period 
  if youre a citizen you are german period    found the shitskin
  wow true europeans having problems with noneuropean aliens encroaching on their land and culture how strange who could imagine such a thing  literally why should any german make compromises for these people
  t ahmed
  being white has nothing to do with german identity if youre a citizen you are german period     yeah but it does make a difference in how you experience germany thats what im asking ignore the haters
  germany is very safe one of the safest places in the world yes even now
lads would 3k4k be enough to see around germany for 23 weeks    lol mate they have a poppulation of like 70 million ethnic germans  even with the 1 million refugees thats a drop in the bucket you are watching too much media propaganda
    no it is not normal but also right wing trends died down several times since the nineties besides that no one wants to see chemnitz
  they have an aging population and arent having children its only a matter of time before that 70 million becomes 30 million
  demographics how does it work  lemme guess american
  wearing pants without a belt  this shit is infuriating he looks like a two year old dressed up in a costume
  germany wouldnt be the same without a sprinkling of brown people they give it character you immediately notice the difference when you go from a 100 german town to a 99 german town people are friendlier more open more lively
  germany wouldnt be the same without a sprinkling of brown people
  oh seriously youre being antisemitic too now seriously
  i can almost guarantee this guy is an amerifat who thinks hes german because he had some random ancestor originate from germany
  germany doesnt exist now
    cant tell if this is good bait or the new userbase after the split
  anon
  been here since 2009 just because some racists decided to overtake /pol/ in 2012 doesnt mean that im somehow going to be scared to post the truth racists can go fuck themselves you are not welcome in my country or elsewhere for that matter there is no place for hatred in 2018
  been here since 2009  not sure about that you sound exactly like the new type of people  i may be wrong but thats how i see it
  brotier       fuck off
  fuck off summer
  ol mate they have a poppulation of like 70 million ethnic germans    make it 60 with 50 of newborns with foreign roots    
  newborns with foreign roots / refugees  but then word definitions do not matter right
  europa ist für die migration in deutschland besonders bedeutsam 360 prozent der 193 millionen personen mit migrationshintergrund stammten 2017 aus einem der 27 anderen mitgliedstaaten der europäischen union weitere 319 prozent aus einem anderen europäischen staat    so thats 679 of the minority with a migration background that come from within europe hardly a sky is falling scenario except for the most stubborn brandenburg proll
    getting cucked out of your own country is totally fine    get fucked bugman
  newborns with foreign roots / refugees  but then word definitions do not matter right    foreigners in germany are underperformers even germans leave germany because they have better job opportunities anywhere else in the world    underperformers require more taxes making a living in germany even more unrewarding for properly skilled workers    low skilled foreigners elect leftist politicans leftist policies require more money making migrating to germany for low skilled workers even more attractive and even more a pain in the ass for normal people    its a vicious cycle with no way out
  lrn 2 stats altfactsman
  people performing menial tasks like wiping my moms arse are underperformers  somebodys gotta do it anon ossies would rather collect their hartz iv and sip beer in breslau they are not gonna help you out if it means they would have to leave their comfort zone
  what about indians then they are all highskilled yet racists like you hate on them for being brown you jump from one excuse to another the only reason you are hating on people is because they are brown youd never hate on a swede who came here to work as a kitchen hand
  race mixing is good though
  all high skilled   nice try rakeesh  the only good ones that immigrate are on the upper crust of society itself
  the only way to make it in from india is with a masters or more   upper crust of society itself  lol the upper crust of society itself wont come here to get shit on by racists like you for being brown they go to the us utter imbecile
  somebodys gotta do it anon    no somebody should just deport all childless boomers and leftist neets    demigration is the future        go to brazil then      what about indians then they are all highskilled yet racists like you hate on them for being brown    again we dont need immigration we need demigration of socially incompatibale groups in society    immigration can only benefit countries if theyre less developed than the immigrants arriving there this is called colonization    to recapture our todays lesson    in white countries immigration should be outlawed and demigration and remigration should be enforced immediately under martial law
  demigration is the future    saying something is the future/the future
i have never felt unsafe in germany and i have prowled around the red light district of frankfurt past midnight in search of hookers while heroin addicts constantly asked for drugs and money
  you better start packing
  ill take my chances that you will expire before demigration transpires funny that its not even a real word in the context you intend one would expect it to enter popular usage before it even becomes reality
  tick tock
anyone been to a fkk club or anything  how much does a girl cost
  2 bratwurst
  are you living under a rock  germany is currently importing 300000 unskilled sandniggers a year  this will not stand man
  entry to club is 50100 eur then each girl is something like 50 eur minimum and each extra like come in mouth is another 50
  why would i do that when i can and want to race mix in my own country
  people are tired of whteoids grandpa you had your chance you blew it lets move on
  300000 sandniggers a year  you mean that 300000 immigrants a year are coming into germany that 300000 middle easter and maghrebi nationals are entering or that 300000 refugees are entering because hate to break it to you but these imply differemt things
  have you ever talked to a refugee they are just normal people dont believe the lies of the press
  300000 middle eastern and maghrebi nationals are entering  thats what i meant as i said
  those are imaginary numbers its not 2015 this year so you might want to move out from beneath that rock yourself
  fuck off you pos muzzie lover
  nothing wrong with muslims they are just people
  so are you but even your mother doesnt want you
  travel there for work 7 times a year probably spent over 35 days there this year alone berlin hamburg munich dresden and ingolstadt place is totally fine never had any issues as a 25 year old white dude from the uk
  so if i wanted to fuck a girl in a fkk it would cost something like 200300 euros
posting this here because i dont want to make another thread     im going to visit some family in central/eastern europe over christmas and ill have some downtime so i was thinking of spending a week or so in berlin     my main interest while there would be electronic music mdma and pretzels does anyone have any experience with such a trip would it be fun and achieveable to do by myself or will i just end up in hostel bars with upper middle class white kids jacking each other off about how authentic their travel experiences are
  check out leipzig too its quickly becoming the new berlin but not quite popular enough to attract the rich dorks
  as long as you dont act or dress like a nugger no ossi will do or say anything
  probably but you dont go to a fkk brothel just to fuck one girl
number of deaths as result of firearm use by police in 2015    us 1146  germany 10     101 rounds discharged in total during the whole year by all german police forces combined of which 48 were warning shots    the us is a criminal hellhole compared to germany and this by several orders of magnitude you guys are our mexico for a reason     /thread
  are you trying to make sense with this lot they are impervious to logic
  i know this is your brain on /pol/ i still had to mention that the all of the german police uses as many bullets a year as american policemen during a single shooting
  nazis  in germany    fucking retard the only person who could possibly do any harm to you is a random immigrant bum dealing drugs in shady bacstreets and parks just avoid suspecious packs of non whites
  the truth    ah sure you own the truth  fuck off nigger faggot and go back to lebit where you belong    t black person who isnt into your guilty tripping shit    fuck off retard
  its a shitty troll from literally r3dd1t  do not reply just report this shit thread
      i live among the neonazis in eastern germany and its terrifying       a german state gains ground against neonazi crime  farright street violence reached a postwar high last year in germany but the oncenotorious state of brandenburg has reversed the trend thanks to a number of organized citizens and focused public official spiegel presents a portrait of a successful push against the neonazi threat      hundreds of neonazis in germany have gone underground  german police are hunting for hundreds of neonazis the interior ministry says there was a significant jump in outstanding arrest warrants in 2016 experts believe that rightwing terrorist networks pose a threat      neonazi crimes soar in germany  neonazi crimes in germany soared last year by 16 per cent according to new government figures       neonazis suspected in long wave of crimes including murders in germany      the national socialist underground murders a series of murders of nine immigrants of turkish greek and kurdish descent between 9 september 2000 and 6 april 2006 the murder of a policewoman and attempted murder of her colleague a 1999 bombing in nuremberg3 the 2001 and 2004 cologne bombings and a series of 14 bank robberies456 the attorney general of germany called the nsu a rightwing extremist group whose purpose was to kill foreigners and citizens of foreign origin7  
  more neonazi crimes celebrating terrorist cell nsu      fake news spurred neonazi riots in germanys chemnitz saxony officials say  it resulted in the death of a german man later revealed to be of cuban descent who was said to have intervened after a woman was repeatedly sexually harassed by migrants that claim was later declared to be false by the chemnitz police  we have to acknowledge that mobilization of the farrightists on the internet was stronger than in the past said michael kretschmer state premier of saxony  the rage of the demonstrators was based on xenophobic comments false information and conspiracy theories  it was based on fake news he stated  the chemnitz police has made it clear that the man who was murdered was actually stabbed during a brawl between two groups of men  mondays clashes of the rallies provoked by the stabbing incident included some 6000 rightwing protesters and around 1000 counterprotesters  he pointed to a growing trend of vigilantism in germany and added that 20000 new police positions were required to remedy the situation  
  german police routinely ignore racist attacks  police in eastern germany routinely ignore racially motivated attacks according to local politicians they have also been accused of manipulating statistics to hide the soaring number of incidents involving neonazis  the chief of police in the state of saxonyanhalt was forced to resign yesterday after it emerged that he had instructed officers not to classify incidents as hate crimes unless the perpetrators were caught  germany has been rocked in recent months by an upsurge in neonazi attacks with mobs targeting people from ethnic minorities  jewish and antiracist groups claim parts of eastern germany have become nogo areas  last month a 17yearold girl had a swastika carved into her hip by a gang of neonazis after she tried to stop them bullying a sixyearold foreign girl  a pregnant iraqi woman needed hospital treatment last weekend after being punched on a bus in magdeburg the state capital of saxonyanhalt  in another incident a group of german men attacked three men and a woman from niger as a crowd of 30 people looked on  
  germany is niggerville and should be gassed while being hanged
ok so i have to preface this by saying that im not a bold traveler and i never lived/traveled in a country were there are nogo zones or where you would think twice about going anywhere on your own at night  so maybe germany is not a warzone but to me it might still feel dangerous/violent  so on the one hand you have terrorist attacks on the other hand you have racists and neonazis and i am a target for both so im worried  i went down the rabbit hole and now i cannot stop reading accounts of violence that i never knew about at this point i dont even care about racism desu unless its physical and violent   my intention was to spend 2 years in germany learn c2 german during this summer and then do a masters at some university  im probably going to stay in some west german student town for the whole duration of my stay  am i worrying too much will i be safe or will i have to watch my back all the time
  i think you should just kill yourself unironically
  where are you from its nearly guaranteed that whatever third world shithole you are from has a far far higher crime rate germany will be much safer than your home
  i dont have the capacity to believe that a fullgrown adult male has written this post this is something fucking suburban soccer moms write below shitty facebook news posts
  imagine being this american
  on the other hand you have racists and neonazis  actually falling for msm bullshit
   if youre a citizen you are german period  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa  hahahahhahahahahahahha
  thats the way it works though and i am not even german germany has not existed for very long so the german identity itself is very much related to whether you are a national or not
  germany is the shits watchout for the muzzies cause those skinnypants german fags cant help you if the muzzies start shit with youfuck germany
  i am not even german  yes we can tell
  lol that picture is in austria
  a qualifier though i am of german heritage so the pie is in your face   at the end of the day if you did not exist until 1871 you dont amount to much as a nation
am i crazy for wanting to visit belfast    im interested in the troubles so id like to take a black cab tour   it seems there is decent nightlife as wellim socially retarded but id like to expand my horizons and try and meet women at bars or a club or whatever    im going to travel for 10 days or so and i am also looking at london glasgow edinburgh and dublinwhat do
  i literally only go to great britain if they pay me to fuck that place especially london
  brit fag here i really dont see why non euros want to come here or ireland go to some where exotic like sea or south america just dont waste your time and money here
  interesting history cool people safe placesseems nice to me
  belfast is a nice enough city
manchester  liverpool  newcastle  are these cities worth a visit
  maybe for a day or two the countryside nearby them is infinitely superior though
  yeah same here its like the nofunallowed aspects of slavland with the everything is expensive part of western europe i fly over them to get to france but thats about the extent of my nonpaid interaction with the british isles
  no unless you like football or nightlife
  imagine being in a loving relationship with her haha
  the only thing crazy is her haircut
    go to cardiff bristol brighton and edinburgh
  belfast is a neat little town  many an hours sweet happiness
  beware of the pretty colleens  theyll fill you up with strong drink my lad till you are unable to stand  and the very next thing that youll know is youve landed in van diemans land
  yes agree    sea is strictly for low lifes
  i am also looking at london glasgow edinburgh and dublinwhat do  easiest way to do all those cities would probably be to fly into london for a bit fly to dublin get the train from dublin to belfast then either fly or get the ferry/train from belfast to glasgow then train from glasgow to edinburgh
i went to belfast during my last ireland trip and to be honest it was pretty cool walking through the nationalist and unionist quarters looking at the murals and along the peace wall the titanic museum was hilarious as well
suppose me a dutch cunt and other dutch cunts go on a roadtrip through great brittain  and we would stay 4 nights in 3 cities which one  should we go to not london
  brits are sluts  dont bother
  am i crazy for wanting to visit    no
  brits are sluts  what is the problem
whats the best country to live in at 2019
your own moving permanently to a country that you werent born in never works out youll always be an outsider youll never fit into the system and youll never receive the same benefits and privileges that native citizens get
  denmark
  the usa   climate you live in a wide range of climates from deserts to snowy mountains  quality of living the richest country in the world and one of the highest gdp per capita everything is cheap and our suburban and rural houses are one of the largest in the world  healthy care is not in the top 5 but pretty good nonetheless best universities in the world  its a relatively safe country and unless you live in a few cities like la or detroit you wont have to worry about violence   the people america has many different subcultureslatinos blacks asian etc but fortunately we keep it all segregated so you can avoid living among certain groups  things to do you can pretty much do most things that you can do anywhere else in the world we also have dozens of good national parks there isnt many historical places like castles or old cathedrals but our downtown architecture can look pretty aesthetic
  whats the best country to live in at 2019  new zealand
  climate you live in a wide range of climates from deserts to snowy mountains  if you dont mind hurricanes to the south and severe snowstorms to the north  quality of living the richest country in the world and one of the highest gdp per capita everything is cheap and our suburban and rural houses are one of the largest in the world  there are currently people starving in the us despite the surplus of food and more empty houses than there are homeless people  healthy care is not in the top 5 but pretty good nonetheless best universities in the world  your healthcare system is so bad that people have to go on kickstarter to be able to afford basic medication  your education system is so shit that most americans cant find their own country on a map  its a relatively safe country and unless you live in a few cities like la or detroit you wont have to worry about violence  you can get shot up by your local altright trigger happy retard any day of the week    youre country is objectively fucked and designed to screw a person 7 ways to sunday i would never consider living in such a shithole and i live in south africa
  based
  if you dont mind hurricanes to the south and severe snowstorms to the north  i mean its not like those natural disasters are caused by people and the death numbers are much much smaller than the homicide rate in third world countries   there are currently people starving in the us despite the surplus of food and more empty houses than there are homeless people  ive never heard about people starving in the us in fact we have a obesity problem  also if you cant find a job to pay for rent in the usa of all places youre either a lazy piece of shit or severely mentally ill  your healthcare system is so bad that people have to go on kickstarter to be able to afford basic medication  therere no excuses to not being able to pay for healthcare unless like i said before you arent physically capable of having a job or youre just lazy   your education system is so shit that most americans cant find their own country on a map  but thats obviously not true yes theres significant number of people who dont know where small european countries are on a map but its not because we dont have maps in our schools we just dont really care about irrelevant countries also white americans do better than scandinavians in the pisa test  you can get shot up by your local altright trigger happy retard any day of the week  you believe that a few altrighters are a bigger problem than black and hispanic violence youre biased it doesnt surprise me that europeans hate america but the funny thing is that your countries are getting more poor and more violent and its all thanks to your stupid and naive worldview  youre country is objectively fucked and designed to screw a person 7 ways to sunday i would never consider living in such a shithole and i live in south africa  oh thats why the whole world would kill to get a green card     keep coping by the harsh realization that youre never going to be a us citizen lol
  im pretty sure indians bangladeshis somalis and afghanis agree with you and will be always happier in their shithole of a country forever fucking idiot
  liberland
  also white americans do better than all colours of scandinavians in the pisa test    im gonna leave you to figure the problem of comparing those particular stats  wonder how you would rank    oh thats why hondurans would kill to get a green card   ftfy    youre an indication that the other anon has a point
if you make good money come to the balkans the cost of living to quality of life is insane compared to western countries restaurants rent going out private healthcare are all extremely cheap relative to the money youd be making as a presumably welleducated westerner belgrade for instance is pretty safe too there are loads of tourists for some reason and you almost never hear about bad shit happening to them if they dont act like retards    objectively the region has some of the most attractive women in the world as well and marrying into eu or us citizenship is a massive plus to all women not just the gold diggers most young people nowadays speak pretty good english as well so you dont really need to learn much of the language either
  keep coping by the harsh realization that youre never going to be a us citizen lol  lol he hates america thats almost exclusively whos let in these days
  you have much to learn as a country consider the age of us it is appaling that so many people are entirely ignorant regarding the history of their own european ancestors    some things work in usa alot of things does not it does not change the fact that there are many other countries which have a higher standard of living
   white americans do better than all colours of scandinavians in the pisa test  but the vast majority of scandinavians are white dude you just lost another argument lol  oh thats why hondurans would kill to get a green card   but theyre coming to america not europe either way the amount of european immigration to america is much higher than the other way around    it does not change the fact that there are many other countries which have a higher standard of living  only by a small amount america wins overall because of all the other points i made in my previous reply
  dude you just lost another argument lol  i like mixing and matching my stats lol  there are other creeds that would alter stats even in scandinavia but you do not care bad data is good data as long as it supports your point hint dont attempt getting a degree    but theyre coming to america not europe  people are not immigrating to europe  another indication of you not possessing the intellectual faculties to continue this discussion       thats why hondurans would kill to get a green card   but theyre coming to america not europe
   like mixing and matching my stats lol  you implied that the racial demographics are the same in both the usa and scandinavia which is just moronic of course america is going to score lower than scandinavia in the pisa test because we have a much higher percentage of third worlders in our country  people are not immigrating to europe  yeah because thats exactly what i meant lol
  you implied that the racial demographics are the same   i like my alternative facts  thats about the third time youve messed up and showed yourself below par  i reiterate you cant mix and match stats to fit your notions ie you can not deduct brown people from us stats and compare with populationwide stats from scandinavia    besides your source that you have not posted is no doubt from some crackpot feelz based nonsense merchant shit in  shit out
  bangladesh
  you can not deduct brown people from us stats and compare with populationwide stats from scandinavia  of course i can because white and asian americans perform great on pisa while hispanics and blacks do shit if youre not a libcuck its not really a surprise why that is the case  besides your source that you have not posted is no doubt from some crackpot feelz based nonsense merchant shit in  shit out  
  of course i can deduct one population group and compare incomparable stats  i do not understand the scientific process but who cares    youre the reason why people laugh at amerifats dont give up your dayjob ya hear
  oh so what happened to the your source that you have not posted is no doubt from some crackpot feelz based nonsense merchant  anyways iq differences between races are real and therere cultural differences between whites/asian and black/hispanics that explain part of their indifference towards studying
  oh so what happened to the   nothing happened to it you are arguing a moot point you presented a source but it still is not relevant for reasons hitherto mentioned but i feel like im throwing pearls for swine here      and therere cultural differences that explain part of their indifference towards studying  you are arguing another case that nobody has brought up here it is a pity that you bring down the average for white people and your education is obviously severely lacking     your inability to make a case and prove it seems to suggest you are not the sharpest tool in the shed please tell me more about the trials and tribulations that you face in your daily experience as an underachiever
  dont rub it in this is trv supposed to be friendly
  after filtering out all the noise from your reply this is the only argument that you made you presented a source but it still is not relevant for reasons hitherto mentioned ive implied that you must be a libcuck in order to ignore the reasons why whites do better than blacks in the pisa test and we were talking about why americans score so low thats it youve lost the argument and its ok to admit it d
  yes i am this retarded  present the combined stats for scandinavia with the figures for people with higher levels of melanin deducted or stay on the bogus side of science petulant child
duh china obviously its the future bruh and so many rainies to choose from
  i decided to ignore your arguments so im just gonna keep a condescending tone to seem like im winning xd  if you werent such a libcuck you would know that therere differences in the average iq of whites and blacks and if you werent such a libshit you would see how black people treat education in their communities  please keep replying because this is so funny lol
  i dont like that my original statement has been proven null and void so ill just pretend that it hasnt    lets play with stats like its your mamas titties feel free    you would know that therere differences in the average iq of whites and blacks  did you know that the german for biro is kugelschreiber since we are answering questions nobody has asked then i felt that this was a suitable response
   dont like that my original statement has been proven null and void so ill just pretend that it hasnt  proven null but you were the one who asked for sources about the racial differences in the pisa score  since we are answering questions nobody has asked then i felt that this was a suitable response  oh so the average iq of a certain group is not relevant at all to their academic performance  its not that im wrong is that you just already made up your mind about those things and wont accept reality cause fuck those fat rednecks 
  you were the one who asked for sources about the racial differences in the pisa score    and you have not shown the racial differences in the pisa score for scandinavia making your statistical comparison irrelevant as you probably dont even know you wrong side of the bell curve permanent dweller you    oh so the average iq of a certain group is not relevant at all to their academic performance  is that your claim i have made no such claim are you having a separate discussion with the fat fuck redneck that is your alter ego
  japan i suppose
  fuck you you piece of shit you think you can come on here and talk to me like that ill have you know im best friends with hiroshima and all i have to do is snitch on you and then boy oh boy youll be in for a world of hurt you complete moron you worthless asshole you have no idea what youve just done do you youve reached the end of the line thats what were on 4channel now buddy and you just cant go around spewing verbal diarrhea like you used to
  making your statistical comparison irrelevant  i see where this is going youre gonna disagree on every point that i make because your mindset is americans are backwards religious bigots while europeans are enlightened open minded people  theres very little hope for you   i have made no such claim  when you said since we are answering questions nobody has asked you were replying to a comment that ive made about the average iq of whites and blacks being different  so again is the average iq of a certain group relevant or not in this context
  somalia
  youre gonna disagree on every point that i make because your mindset is    now thats a strawman no i am gonna disagree with your comparative stats assertion since it combines two different types of incomparable data and draws a conclusion you can not draw with support of the numbers presented you might know this or you might just be of such an inferior intellect that you do not understand the issue your performance here indicates the latter    is the average iq of a certain group relevant or not in this context    does iq affect educational performance what kind of a retarded childlevel question is that you should be ashamed of yourself
  does iq affect educational performance what kind of a retarded childlevel question is that  with all things considered im gonna take that as a yes so thats it part of the reason why blacks do shit on the pisa is cause dem niggas be low iq  next
  part of the reason why blacks do shit on the pisa is cause dem niggas be low iq  i am again arguing against claims nobody has made    you just gotta be female
   am again arguing against claims nobody has made  your argument is that america has a shitty educational system and thats why it scores relatively low when compared to european countries and my counter argument is that the same would be the case for europe if had a similar racial/cultural background as america   you agreed that iq is relevant so that destroys half of your argument
  the same would be the case for europe if had a similar racial/cultural background as america    and you have presented no data to support your claim besides people that argue weakly like yourself is the main reason why amerifats are regarded as ignorant     you agreed that iq is relevant so that destroys half of your argument  in some kind of alternate reality perhaps  so what is your iq
  and you have presented no data to support your claim  this is so retarded lol so the average iq of a certain group is relevant to their academic performance but suddenly it becomes irrelevant depending on where theyre in the world africans in general have a lower average iq independently of where they are  but muh socialeconomical problems   you could make a good case for both probabilities their countries suck because theyre low iq or theyre low iq due to environmental determinism twin study makes the latter seems less relevant
  so the average iq of a certain group is relevant to their academic performance but suddenly it becomes irrelevant depending on where theyre in the world    is that a statement a claim who are you arguing with     but muh socialeconomical problems   another statement nobody has made    you ignored the questions before  1 are you female  2 what is your iq  added 3 are you sauced up right now    i need to get some closure on this shifting goalpost and/or imaginary conversation in your head thing that you got going
        argues that americans are smart like a retard
  is that a statement a claim who are you arguing with   you asked me about sources that shows the academic performance of different racial groups in scandinavian countries the point to confirm whether or not iq can be accountable for the subject of the matter if blacks perform just as good as native swedes then that means that the educational system is responsible to how much people learn  another statement nobody has made  i cant think of any other rational counter argument that you could make     lay your cards on the table lil bitch
   the point  to show that you are of such a low intellectual level that you do not understand when stats can be compared and when they cant present pisa stats for scandinavian countries with the brown peoples data removed or stay corrected     i cant think of any other rational counter argument  well we already know the level of your think by now try learning about common fallacious arguments spend six months reading about em then check back in    also how do you deal with losses in boardgames with your family i am guessing you are the worst loser ever with them as well    to confirm whether or not iq can be accountable for education results  here you go again nicely done trying to prove that amerifats are not ignorant being all ignorant about it do you need arguments for the spherical shape of the earth or do you need proof stated for that as well
  you ignored the questions before  1 are you female  2 what is your iq  added 3 are you sauced up right now
   present pisa stats for scandinavian countries with the brown peoples data removed or stay corrected   and my argument to that is that most of scandinavia is like 90 white  all the rest of your reply can be ignored because youre not even attempting to make any arguments
  90 white  which makes the stats incomparable with your cherrypicked 100 white fatties so very irrelevant as a method of comparison bring up the 100 white scandi data or forever remain irrelevant a feelz you ought to be used to by now    hope you did not skew the stats too much by participating in them you make any group look bad by association    you ignored the questions before  1 are you female  2 what is your iq  added 3 are you sauced up right now
  which makes the stats incomparable with your cherrypicked 100 white fatties  lol so 10 less white people means a lower score what are you trying to prove if scandinavian education was so much better than ours youd still score higher even with that demographics difference
  so 10 less white people means a lower score    being pedagogical now since you seem to need it do you see those fatty pisa stats what changes when you remove the foreigners what changes when you remove black people what happens when you add asians to the mix what happens when you remove the mutts and keep the really white ones this is low level arithmetic
  does altering the input change the output  dear god yes
  what happens when you add asians to the mix  but asians score lower than whites on average  what happens when you remove the mutts and keep the really white ones  but its only a 10 difference that would be insignificant if scandinavians had a significant better educational system   we arent arguing whether or not americans score higher than scandinavians but that the latter are suppose to be much better than the former white americans score higher on average than japanese students japan is 99 japanese
  but its only a 10 difference that would be insignificant  a you are picking the numbers out of your arse you do not know if 102030 should be excluded  b the stats are still incomparable unless you run the data on scandinavian whities only do it or stay stumm  c you claiming that incompatible stats are compatible is circumstantial evidence that fatties are retards  d you do not get to do exclusions also you are le 56 face ie white is not white in the us    pic related white person in the us
  forgot about the last part of my reply isnt japan supposed to have one of the best educational systems in the worldalthough not so great higher education also the adjectives that you used to refer to americans shows that you must believe that scandinavians receive a much better academic education than us i completely and utterly destroyed this argument and now were only seeing the remaining of your rotting corpse trying to make a comeback
  isnt japan supposed to have one of the best educational systems in the world    i do not know do they i am not japanese are you japanese    the adjectives that you used  you must believe that scandinavians receive a much better academic education than us    which adjectives    i completely and utterly destroyed this argument     which argument i bet i did not make the argument you think i made we already know that there is a discrepancy between what we are talking about and what you think we are talking about    go ahead and run the data now white scandinavians pisa scores vs white fatties pisa scores what do you find
  lmao butthurt african
  which adjectives  youre the reason why people laugh at amerifats or  amerifats are regarded as ignorant  white scandinavians pisa scores vs white fatties pisa scores what do you find  lets talk about a little country called finland its 993 finn/swedish/estonian and theyre ahead of us by about 1 point in the pisa score theyre considered to have the best educational system in the world
this thread is shit everybody here needs to fuck off back to /pol/
  and you have to go back lol
  youre the reason why people laugh at amerifats   amerifats are regarded as ignorant  both true has very little to do with education youre just shit    lets talk about a little country called finland  not scandinavia stop shifting the goalpost  also japan outranks white fatties in everything but reading maybe not so strange since fatties would be completely illiterate if you had as many letters as they do    now fuck off back to pol
  has very little to do with education youre just shit  hmmm i dont really believe you at all  not scandinavia  buuuuuuut lets just forget about the part where it says that they have the best educashionnel system in mars  japan outranks white fatties in everything but reading  only by a few points which still makes their average lower than ours lmao
  japan average lower than ours  nope retard you cant count produce a valid reference or die from freaky accident post haste    lmao  did you really write that    pic related master race in comparison
  nope retard you cant count produce a valid reference or die from freaky accident post haste  well i was getting the average from here  where whites average is 531 the chart that you posted shows that japan average score is 528 but wiki shows that whites average is 518  pic related master race in comparison  asians are not really attractive to me but whatever
  science ranking is average pisa ranking  ignores the fact that your figures show 531 in science literacy and japan ranks 538  ignores the fact that japan beats white fatties in average pisa rankings too    switch on damage control quick quick think of something
  table s10 average scores of us 15yearold students on the pisa science literacy scale by race/ethnicity 2015  oh i realized that its only about science and its equal to wikipedia so yeah japan scores higher than the us and they exceed in math same thing with other asian countries but we still do pretty good and werepretty close to the best educational system in the world   the usa does not score higher than japan which means that were a very retarded people
  werepretty close to the best educational system in the world     citation needed    were a very retarded people    the first true statement you have made today
  citation needed  finland scores 522 on average and we white boys score 518   the first true statement you have made today  i forgot to mention that finns are also a very retarded people because they score lower than one of the best
  white boys score  that is not a ranking of educational systems but you do not possess the faculties to grok that   also finns are about as white as albino negros unless they are of the swedish minority but i know i am speaking way over your comprehension level now
  that is not a ranking of educational systems  annnnnd were back again at this stupid argument you kept me asking to show statistics of scandinavian countries and the pisa score of the native population without obvious dead weights like africans or hispanics the point was to confirm if our low score can be attributed to the level of education that we receive  finns are about as white as albino negros unless they are of the swedish minority  even if that was true it doesnt matter because they have the best you already know
  our almost as xlnt education system can not improve our nonwhites enough to make us rank ok though finlands excellent educational system can do that with their nonwhite majority    face it youre mediocre especially you you are far below the typical pic related finn
   can not improve our nonwhites enough to make us rank ok  but you were literally saying that is not fair to compare denmark or whatever to us whites because theyre at least 10 non white aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
  greentext how do i use it  but you were literally saying   that is not what literal means and no
  at this point it seems like youre just trolling so im gonna leave
  thats gotta hurt considering your special features i was having so much fun  sorry you could not keep up
for me probably hong kong low taxes the city is always awake if you want to go out or buy a meal at 3am or something everything is cheap as fuck except rent and certain areas for eating out the public transport is 1 in the world and better than tokyo by far it has beautiful scenery and beaches to enjoy on the weekend     only bad thing is xi winnie the poo jinping going full 1984 on china and subsequently hk
    yall filled up this whole thread with your retched autism i bet you are both fun at parties
if well off america if not europe    t ausfag
  usa by leaps and bounds
  i sure fucking hope not
  youre a fucking mong for thinking that more than 2/3 of americans could find america on a map and    youre a fucking mong for thinking its a unis job to teach students where to find countries on a map
america if you make more than 50k a year
best country to live in  /trv/ picks usa    i expected better of you guys to be honest
  suggest something then fag
  fuck you you dogshitforbrains retard
  if all the educated people left those countries those countries will forever remain 3rd world shithole
  sweden was in the top 5 ten years ago before diversity came to sweden
  top 5  facts mean nothing to me  shithead those are 2015 data posted  2009 rankingsjpg
  fucking lol   poor people that cant take care of themselves experience very low quality of life in the united states  thats how it should be dummy have fun in south africa i heard russia will take you if you havent already fled
  what you say is partially true you will always be an outsider you will never have friends and you will never have the connection that youd have with people back home  however there are also benefits to be gained from living abroad for example i grew up in a rich tiny country i live abroad because i want space and fresh air and nature and my great job i would never have these things back home
  tiny not many opportunities and super insular culture not good for foreigners    salaries are low and its too far away from everything else    thats cheating you need to mention a state    too poor and super alien culture     one of the few countries were being white does not protect you from racism    the other country where being white also makes you a target for racists    my personal pick would be scotland  easier than most to integrate in since you already speak english  not as stupid as uk proper   more developed than uk  beautiful cities  world renowned universities  uptight people but still more friendly than most northern europeans  beautiful nature    also from my experience france and italy and spain and portugal in terms of pure comfort those are the best countries but its hard to find work netherlands is nice but super overcrowded dont go there    and yet im going to germany lol see how that goes
  absolutely no mention of culture  i see what you did here sneaky guy
  thats a positive the less culture the easier it is to integrate what you want is superficial commercial culture like in the us so that you can enjoy international food and festivals while being perfectly able to mind your own business and live your own live without some local getting offended and telling you off  meanwhile in old countries with culture the moment you step out of the plane everyone is judging you and criticizing you without even bothering to explain what you did wrong as if you are supposed to immediately absorb the culture from the air and know instinctively what to do to appease the locals
  bollocks its all about language uk has loads of culture yeah argue away as long as you know the language and know not to stand on the wrong side in escalators youre hunky dory
  youll always be an outsider youll never fit into the system  but im always an outsider in the country where i was born and i never fit into the system there  ive hacked the system i can now be an outsider anywhere but also get the exotic foreigner syndrome and get laid way more in a place where im no more of an outsider and weird than i was before
  in my jew cuck canada we give out all that like its nothing
  im trying to figure this out myself my short list is czech hungary slovakia slovenia switzerland karlsruhe taiwan hainan vietnam thailand basically where ever i can get a decent nonenglish teaching job that pays the bills is what it will come down to
  id say america but it has become too unsafe and each time has more violent protests and overall chaos  so ill go for any scandinavia country
  too far away from everything else  thats the main reason
  that is exactly why im also living away from home i never fit in back home either
uk easily     based public healthcare so you can not die and support those who cant afford it    excellent racial diversity and tolerance comes with british politeness    food is unrivalled any any other nation  cant beat a good roast    women are gorgeous and theres a beautiful english rose around every corner    bbc available to everyone as long as you pay a small fee which is well worth it
  haha yeah its just great here haha
  agree with the positives but how about some negatives  very low salaries  cost of living is high  densely populated  housing is super expensive and tenants have less protection    within europe it seems like there is a choice  uk where integration and life is super easy because it is welcoming and multicultural but life is expensive and you will be poor  western europe where integration is hard and then even harder than you think it is going to be but living standards are better and locals will hate you more but still living standards are better
  none of them theyre all bad
  excellent racial diversity and tolerance comes with british politeness  ironically enough youre accepting plenty of impolite people into your country
    whoosh
  not them not even british but the irony was poorly construed for example there are actually a large amount of stunning females in the uk its just that the landwhales are terrible there is also a lot of very good food also the countryside can be quite stunning these things are rarely known but still true
  all immigrants are polite to a fault and try very hard to be even more british than the brits the only impolite people in britain are the chavs and the racists
  i am british and our women are genuine dogs went to italy a few months ago and the average young woman there was leagues above your average bong wench       hi guardian
  i guess you live in a poor area the gulf between the looks of women from poor and affluent areas in britain is staggering
western euro countries excluding uk    you have relatively egalitarian societies not much violence decent healthcare and education systems peace a bit of freedom relatively safe food and good infrastructure  uk was more big brother than the rest of europe in the first place but they are gonna use brexit as an excuse to go all out with the 1984 madness they are also heading towards flood shortage and whatever that comes with that its going to be interesting to see whether they can implode without dragging the rest of europe with them or not
  to be fair i do live in a midlands shithole
  there are actually a large amount of stunning females in the uk    you havent travelled much every other country ive been to has had better looking women i agree that the food is underrated      not him but i live in edinburgh which is the richest in the uk per capita i grew up in the poorest area of the uk and can confirm that theres very little difference the average woman is dire looking
  every other country has better looking women does not invalidate my claim that there are a large amount of stunning females in the uk  you havent travelled much  50 nations or so and half my life outside the country of my birth is that much
  scotland  yeah well
  throws acid on you    ooga booga
is india a good country for an american born hispanic to move to  other western coutries are too consumerist and liberal for my liking  id feel like id stand out too much in eastasian countries  middle eastern  latin american coutries are violent shitholes  india doesnt have the best quality of life but atleast its not very violent and ill fit it because i look similar to indians
  where can i find my conservative wunderland where i an outsider will fit in    nowhere get a trailer in the desert where you live you think indians will accept you lel x 100
  i look like an indian even indians have confused me for one if i learn their language and respect their culture i dont think they will have a problem with me
  edinburgh    basically england at this point
  the reason america is in the downward spiral it is in is because retards like you who are obsessed with winning are allowed to vote
  confirmed for not knowing anything about india    unless they can fit you into a bracket of their 3000 year or older caste system you will remain lower than a dalit read some books
  so should i have voted for bernie or hillary
  lol
  yeah i understand why classism is so rampant in britain when it is so visible    brits should be proud of this i dont think any country has handled integration quite so well
  you shouldve voted for someone with an iq beyond the double digits but clearly you voted for the guy who got a 90 and thought  hey thats an a  thats a great score the best
  bernie sounded honest and had good ideas and no faults literally dont get whyd you not go for him
  theyre traitors to their countries and rejected abroad due to not being part of the host culture they could have used their talents to turn their countries around instead they ran like birches
  actually they are super successful abroad and then they bring back lots of wealth and experience and knowledge to their native countries   its a winwin for everyone involved
  i would never consider living in such a shithole and i live in south africa  in south africa  holy shit this has to be bait
  jesus christ you live in a bubble
  you shouldnt have voted for anyone because youre too susceptible to bullshit
  it is
so tell me boys whats the skinny on montana i have family up there ive never met i was thinking of getting in touch with but i know nothing about the state im an east coast boy  maybe this isnt the best board for this it came to me while i was browsing /tv/ i just really was wondering about it and wanted the 4channel take  pic unrelated
its big its open it has actual cowboys and ranchers and cows and shit it costs a shitload during the summer because they have to make their money for the whole year off the tourists that come through then    theres some incredible scenery if you go through the back roads route 12 from missoula to spokane is worth it head down into yellowstone over beartooth pass and its worth it    driving around on the interstate you see almost nothing until suddenly theres a refinery or a mining operation and then it stinks horribly for half an hour while you go through the fumes    restaurants are mostly either terrible or chain because why bother doing it right when youre the only place in fifty miles as an east coast boi they will horsewhip you if you tell them how much better the food is back in joisey or new yawk though desu you deserve it anyway for supporting the democrats    with family there maybe youd get to see more of the fun stuff i mostly see the state as a long boring crossing as i go from washington to chicago unless im going out of my way to see the scenic parts
the hidden gem of america if you ask me unreal scenery good people and not crowded
whats the best way to travel around italy in winter    mainly from rome to florence    is train service good over there
  hitchhike
  despite the costant bitching and moaning about the biblical delays which if you were to believe 90 of the accounts would happen everyday which is definitely not the case the train service on thyrrenic italy is great while there are a couple of weaker spots the line connecting florence to la spezia the naplesreggio calabia line the train service between cities is reasonably frequent relatively cheap if you plan at least 24 hours in advance and will get you to the city centres of most major cities way faster than using a car would      now adriatic italy has a worse train service due to both terrain and a general forgetfulness from both the government and people in general so a car might be your best bet there       one thing i can tell you is that unless youre going to sicily from rome up or sardinia from rome down or in either case youre in the east going by plane is simply not worth it the airport security hassle at the beginning and retrieving baggages at the end will take you way more time than the total 40to60 minutes of actual flight youll be doing and the costs are such that the highspeed train line will beat flying in terms of costs in all cases and even in terms of time for things like romeflorence/pisa or romevenice
  i am leaving for rome and will be in roma for next two weeks  if you want to hangout n stuff let me know
traveling to visit my girlfriends parents in treviso in december were planning on going down to venice for a couple of days wanted to know what the best way is to get around within treviso my girlfriend already told me its useless to rent a car since were going to venice but i still believe it might be worth it for traveling within treviso
  train service is good kind of slow but cheap youll be fine    validate your ticket on the platform youll face a massive fine if your ticket isnt validated i didnt know im a tourist is not an excuse thatll fly
any spanish on here im in spain for the first time seville then later madrid i dont really speak spanish and most of my travel has been to northern europe where they do things much differently anything i should know phrases so i dont look stupid or secret local areas i hate acting like and looking like a tourist
  just use google translate  spanish is one of the best downloaded dictionaries the language app has you dont even have to type just talk into your phone and then rotate it so the person can read the screenbuy a good wrist mount strap so you dont have to actually hand your 1000 phone to a complete stranger

how many capsule hotels exist in europe and where are they located    i know of one in london saint christophers village and another in edinburgh kick ass hostelsthere must be more right    the ability to stay in a capsule would make me far more interested in a city desu
just google city capsule hotel dude wtf
  ooh
    never been in one but jesus fuck do they look comfy
theyre not really capsule hotels like youd find in japan theyre just dorm rooms with beds that have been made to look like capsules    there have often been plans to open massive capsule hotels in london they wanted to turn the trocadero into a 500 bed capsule hotel but fire regulations mean youd need so many fire exits that its often not economically viable
  i remember walking up and down those stairs beside the edinburgh kick ass hostels to get to high school every day
i almost booked a room in city hub in amsterdam  50 euros per night
  they look like something youd find in a spaceship or some shit weird but also kinda cool and probably really comfy
  posh cunt
  any good
    for whatever reason i like the idea of sleeping in a tiny enclosed and maximally /comfy/ space as long as i have enough room to sorta spread out i think id sleep well in a capsule
  never been in one but jesus fuck do they look comfy    they are cool like the first time and for the first maybe 4 hours then you realize you cant spread out that much you begin to realize your own bo and circulation for air heating/cooling is shit i still stay in them but only as a crash pad nothing else also you can generally hear the other people next to you doing fuck all and often masterbating
  i stayed in a typical hotel in a huge old townhouse the room wasnt any bigger than that thing
    damn theyre getting cozy in there wonder what they did after the picture was taken jeepers i wish there was more of these
going to spend 3 weeks there     what should i do/expect never traveled out the country on my own for a time like this
  3 weeks will be a long time to spend in hong kong desu its a tiny place theres lots of food and culture some nature/hikes but really youll run out of stuff to do after about a week ive been three times and my favourite thing still is probably happy valley racecourse on expats day good vibes but then im a bit of a degenerate alco     have you looked into making a day trip into china you can get a special tourist visa that takes you to guangzhou etc though i think you have to be on a tour still its worth it if youre going all that way anyway     on that note might as well check out macau spend some money baby
where are you staying three weeks has got to be pretty expensive    three weeks is about two weeks too long unless you really like urban exploring there are shitloads of bars and restaurants and because a lot of places arent located at street level you could spend a lifetime visiting them all    the shops and malls arent anything particularly special i rate bangkok as better for that    i guess you could probably spend a week or more just doing short trips to places like macau lantau or some beaches if youre going when the weather is nice    i like hong kong the nature and hiking was actually the most pleasant surprise i really recommend doing some prep work on places to eat as there are gems youd never find unless you already know where to go     personally i would consider also flying somewhere else since youre coming all that way and flights are cheap from hkg
do a bunch of hiking my dude theres so many amazing and breath taking trails did one in the pouring rain broke my camera for the day so i couldnt take hq photos fucking kill me lmao but i got to stand up there alone and look at all of hong kong by myself the only noise was the wind
some anon went recently   and visited chungking mansions and got offered some sex and other things
as was already mentioned 3 weeks is a lot of time definitely try and do a mainland trip and try and go over to macau those will certainly eat up a day each at least the museum of coastal defence is a great one for local/military history as well and you can kill a bunch of time there you have enough time to do pretty much everything major and much more so just get there and do everything
  its fucking horrible ive lived there 5 years as an american expat its a shithole   inb4 why are you there then  the money its called selling your soul     tourist stuff to do  big buddah  take the tram up the peak  night market in mongkok   watch the evening light show from the bar at the top of the sheraton  can also take one of those imitation junk boat evening trips and watch the light show from the water   single watch the maid parade go to wanchai bar 109 on lockhart road at 10am on a sunday yes i said 10am you wont beleibe your eyes the flip and indo maids get sundays off theyre like slaves to chinese families and party like its 1999 on sundays staring in the morning you can fuck most of them for 5001000hkd too most freelance hook theres plenty of short time hotels on lockhart rd    want to watch what expat life does to people go to the mid levels staunton and elgin street on a nice saturday and sunday afternoon and youll see staggering numbers of expat housewifes dunk as fuck at brunch at 1pm because theres literally nothing else to do after you live here a while     pic related its the view from my 420 sqft flat which is 3500 usd yes 3500 usd a month in rent
also op if youre into whoring or free lance whoring ie the maids never ever go into the lockhart rd bars that have curtains and a mamasan our front never they are ultra ultra rip off joints     stick to the places that are stacked with freelancers like new makati pic escape neptune     again dont go into the places with red curtains and a mamasan begging you to go inside     interesting and true article  
  sorry heres a better link    
op why someone suggested you want to go to guangzhou wow its beyond me maybe because ive spent 5 years here including having to go to guangzhou and shanghai often for work mainland cities are an even bigger shithole than hk    if you have people to shop for or are a girl yourself sorry about the whoring posts then one thing you could do is take the train across the border to shenzen though youll need a mainland visa depending on what passport youre holding to go knockoff shopping there is an entire mall which means 10 story building crammed with small shops selling knock off shit for cheap you have to bargain true religion jeans prada gucci purses fake rolexs etc its all garbage but it looks damn near like the real thing
  its all garbage  the stuff that isnt knockoff can be decent quality but id look closely at it you could pick up some nice chinese fashion there something thats a blend of traditional styles and modern fashion also traditional stuff i suppose  the mall is targeted at hong kong housewives but its mostly targeted at chinese hong kong housewives not quite tourists    mainland visa  the mall is at luohu which is called lowu on the hong kong side you can get a visaonarrival at the checkpoint there though you need to keep an eye out for the escalator that goes up to that office its right before the immigration counters its a bit pricey and the price goes up for some citizens i think us citizens pay usd150 or something its five days for shenzhen only  the easier and cheaper way is to get a tourist visa from an hk travel agent which nearly all of them can do
  where you notice the trash part i was talking about is in the zippers bigly youre right in that the jean or purse fabric they make the stuff out of seems fine many shops will even swear to you that its the same exact roll of material the real factories use but just stolen the zippers are low quality and will break on ya     the watches are generally garbage tho     i didnt know about the visa on arrival for shenzen as ive had a china m visa my whole time working in hk but that is really good for op to know if he wants to do a run there i dont think that is at all applicable at all to guangzhou bj or shanghai     i noticed ops pic is jfkhkg if op is a native city kid he may actually enjoy 3 weeks in hk im from small town america and i cant stand it the noise the people per square foot theres a joke that the national bird is hk is the jackhammer but if youre used to  city life you might enjoy a vacation here
  op here checking in     thanks for all the recommendations guys to settle some things yes i am a born and bred new yorker so itll be interesting to see another awesome city packed with as much culture as my own   second i know 3 weeks is long but id hate to be running around trying to cram everything into one week life as a native to a city has to be casual on some level to understand the people at least in my opinion also i chose hong kong specifically because it was a good city to visit other cities from deff going to hit up guangzhou and macau probably some islands as well     someone asked where id b staying and i pretty much just plan on staying in the absolute cheapest hostel i can get 3 weeks living abroad adds up but i figure if i book far enough in advance it should be cheapish maybe about 500 for the 3 weeks     i will be there in april so not too hot not too cold and not too busy with tourists seems like a decent time to visit as any weather has been described to be in low 70s and from time to time misty sounds surreal and just how i like my cities     deff excited about all the foods ill be able to eat and i didnt know they had awesome trails but im totally stoked for that desu i really have to figure out the visa thing you guys mentioned since i dont want to just do a tour of guangzhou and would rather actually see it for myself     lastly i dont fuck prostitures or brothel women or whatever
  sounds more fun and looks better than london
  visa on arrival for shenzen  i dont think that is at all applicable at all to guangzhou bj or shanghai  no ive heard people say that they didnt have any trouble going around guangzhou but youre probably not supposed to i certainly wouldnt go any further on it
  i still cant believe someone wants to visit guangzhou its a shithole get used to pollution and constantly smelling cigarette smoke and urine not even kidding there is a smal river of human urine that runs curbside at the guangzhou east train station     tho op is from nyc so he might be used to that but it makes me want to puke everytime im sent to gz for work
  as you said everything that makes a metropolis is what you dislike  i have lived in hk as an expat too and i keep fondest memories than what you seem to experience  ive had several friends colleagues and relatives who have visited the city with me and only one truly disliked it he too hated big cities most of the others have visited again or plan to
  guangzhou isnt that bad much of it is actually pretty clean and comfy ive been to the east station lots and not noticed the urine river youre talking about  i kind of like it desu its a modern cosmopolitan city that still has a jungle aesthetic in some places    i think theyve b smoking in restaurants now it certainly wasnt common when i was there and its not even particularly polluted the aqi is usually near western levels because its a coastal city and gets clean ocean air all the time
  absolute cheapest hostel i can get    stay in chungking mansions  youll fear for your life but its cheap and its right in amongst a lot of cool shit
  because if youve never left your country and youre travelling all that way anyway why not see it just for the sake of seeing something so completely foreign to what youre used to think of it as an ethnographic tour not ever trip has to be about entertainment or even culture ive been to tonnes of shit places many far far worse than guangzhou out of pure curiosity and i loved it you wouldnt want to live there but to be there just for the fuck of it go ahead
  its cheap i guess but not as cheap as it could be and if you go a few blocks north you can get somewhat nicer minihotels that you can actually turn around in for the same price  if you really want tst though mirador mansions is around the corner and somewhat cheaper
guy saying hk is shit is the kind of sad boomer who rides maids on the weekend    lel    other expat here hk is great    phoneposting now but ill reply more fully shortly
  i have to get my visa stuff sorted out so i can visit mainland china doesnt seem too difficult or long of a process thanks for the heads up yall         yes i want to visit it because it looks like some mega dank city metropolis     awesome searched this real quick and im so down for it do i have to email each individual guesthouse to check availability or how does this work still a noob     ill check this place out too cause why not but chungking seems like a super authentic stay option     waiting for you to post
im just back i was there for a week really liked it favourite places were mong kok wan chai chi lin nunnery central plaza sky level was a nice free view i mainly went for photography opportunities    i wanted that mega ity vibe too but i think i had enough after 45 days id definitely always go somewhere else this trip was a starting point for similar lengths of time in korea taiwan and japan
  russell another young financial analyst said he had paid for sex over 50 times using seedy sex sites where customers rate prostitutes and give them tripadvisorstyle reviews  is this an english language site what is it i find it strange that china would not block such a site but perhaps the rules are looser in hk i know winston used to go there to upload his videos
  that map  nigga are you taking a fucking space shuttle to hong kong
  t flat earther
  of course not  the space shuttle hasnt flown since 2012
  im from small town america and  i was reading through all your posts and going wtf but it all makes sense now ive met others who dont like hk and i never understood why this might be it
this is what lkf looked like last night    so much culture
heres a pic i took of an alley in wan chai
lockhart road
      i only hang out with degenerate expat losers  but its the city thats the problem  whte people were a mistake
  that doesnt look fun but i imagine this is just one small place where people go for hookers     that looks awesome and id love to go walking through it     dont see anything wrong with this
  what is your job
  whats your job
  i want to ride maids i live with my parents in boring canada
  how do you become a financial analyst
what can i do here alone at night
  nice
  whats so good about the racecourse  can you go alone    when i looked it up seemed like a place to go with friends to drink  what if youre friendless and dont have the skills to make friends with strangers
  how can i make the money you make
  you probably want a masters of finance and/or mba  then youd get a job in a finance company move to wall st then move to hong kong something like that ought to work
  whats so good about the racecourse  theres a crowd cheering a lot thats about it unless you like horses or losing money    can you go alone  of course they dont point and call you out for eating beans or anything    when i looked it up seemed like a place to go with friends to drink  pretty much an expensive place to drink a limited range of shit stuff too the food and drinks are concerttier like any other stadium    what if youre friendless and dont have the skills to make friends with strangers  it would probably suck i did go with a group from a hostel on an organised trip so it wasnt as bad as it could have been
  i find it strange that china would not block such a site  you dont understand because youre a moron  china doesnt block hk internet and except for politics hk is still free    prostitution is legal in hk under very specific conditions both illegal and legal prostitution exists but the illegal is mostly tolerated too    review sites exists and are fine catalogue sites exist too
  thats the quietest part of lkf and its probably a bit late or a bit early but that crowd there probably extend down the street and around the corner dont they    anyway lkf is basically just a street party with a bunch of bars and clubs so its not an inacurate pic and that pic is pretty much what people are after
  wow poor decision  huge interesting world but you choose almost the lamest place of all  next go to singapore for a month
  my sisters husband played second division soccer in germany until he was about 30 then joined one of the big 4 6 years later and hes bringing in over 200k
  is he in audit    tfw work at big4  make 75k canuckbucks  been here 4 years  hate my job  partners in audit start at 150k200k and thats after 10 years  another 24 years to become an equity partner  other industries like management consulting transactions and corporate finance probably make more
  he gets a promotion every year hes trying to put off being a partner since hell have no life and hes trying to raise a family not even sure what he does but more or less he just helps companies get good tax breaks says he hates accountants etc he basically is scheduled to get a raise every year but turned it down recently guess hes just a consultant
op here anyone have good spots to visit seen a lot of argument about whether hk is good or not to visit but not tooooo much about places to go or things to see or stuff to try     ps i picked hk over other places like singapore because its huge and is close to other cities i can visit
  im 34 too late
  at the end of the day what is the point of your life cant a computer do your job better when you look back on your life will you think  i feel great about making company x more money 
  its never really too late but do you have any relevant experience or education
  no but thinking of going back to school
this threads been pretty cool
    im gonna be 34 in three months and im doing a gmat prep to make a play for stanford and chicagolands kellogg nw and booth uc where i live any ideas about places to get a wellpaying mba ive heard breaking into finance is a bitch
im 23 f and currently work in marketing at a popular internet brand in new york i dont necessarily like my job low morale due to office politics and sometimes grueling hours mindless tasks little to no ideation pissy salespeople but have taken to a couple other endeavors ecommerce real estate to fill an insatiable thirst to have a career that is mine and not the dream of another     lately ive felt pretty aimless  new york is a heady jungle of art culture and opportunity but also overstimulating and sometimes vain im passionate about sustainability inclusive economics social justice performance and innovative design but have done nothing in those respective spaces in a long while i want to start a podcast but dont have time i want to enroll in a screenwriting class but dont have the guts so i woke up one day and told my anxiety to go fuck itself and booked this damn trip travel is really a blessing  its uncomfortable frustrating but also invigorating and humbling my father would always tell my siblings and i of his longing to see the world beyond his small village at home but the lack of financial freedom in the life of a haitian immigrant with triplets who all needed to go to college cut it short i guess i made a silent pledge that i would live the dream he worked hard to curate we dont have much of a relationship he was a solid provider but not the best dad but i hope to reach a point where i can make sit alongside with him as his seemingly impossible dream comes to fruition    so im going to hong kong 10 days in april apart from exploring the city eating very regularly and meeting fellow travelers im not sure what im looking for yet at least internally maybe it will be the push necessary to claw out the standard and embody the avant garde that ive always respected and sometimes idolized maybe itll just be a good story to tell the kids one day
  i forgot to post     ill post later this evening    hk is some good shit though    but hopefully youre not here in jan or feb as it rains and is cold all the time nowhere has any heating because its so hot the rest of the year
  op here thats awesome youll be in hk when im there and i too am from nyc 
  are you sure
  sounds good dude what is the purpose of your stay in hong kong do you recognize some of the challenges i have described with living in ny and wanting to realize yourself as a female i find that the world and life will always be pegged against me sorry if im a bit vague in my communication this boy i had intercourse with proved to be a superficial twat who was quoting stockhausen and lou reed just to appear cultured he wasnt even trying to build something real so im drinking rum and cokes to cope
how much does one spend in hong kong on an average day how much should you be thinking of having if you were to be there for a month like op
  really depends on where you stay  for me including accommodation for us a couple with 1 child this december 21 till 28 about 300eur/day 50 in case we do unexpected shopping/xmas gifts  factor in the holidays season that inflate all the prices a frugal traveler off season could spend less than 20eur a day stay in a bottom of barrel hostel eat street foods walk/mtr/ferry/ light bus everywhere get drunk off 7eleven booze and attend free museums/exhibitions   to me a comfortable stay on the cheap would be around 100 eur/day a room at the mini hotel central coffee shop breakfast local fast food for lunch pub/bar foods at night with a couple drinks the occasional taxi ride to the most remote parts one paying visit every 2 days
  so what would 50 eur a day give me in april i dont mind staying in a hostel but a decent location would be a plus
  ive seen some rooms in chungking for 70150hkd a night thatd be like 1020 usd per day on shelter would it be feasible to see myself spending 100 dollars a day max including my housing of course more some days and less others in april
  i guess a decent private room in a hostel between tst and mongkok breakfast in a mc café if you need western fare i dont feel like eating congee or noodles when i wake up  have lunch in café de coral/fairwood or at the food corners/delis in malls city super for instance  a pint or a drink in a bar and a dinner in a sushi bar noodles joint or pub the room itself in my 100eur scenario is 50eur/night  id advise to plan at list a drink in a fancy bar and a dinner at a high end restaurant google early bird menu hk during your stay so you can see the city like the ballers experience it every day
whats a good place for four 18 year old lady to hang out in hong kong brother is going with some friends and want some stuff to do maybe some bars
  a small but clean airbnb in a relatively accessible area or a larger place in a more remote area    disgusting dont do this actually nevermind this is /trv/ definitely do this you filthy backpacker scum
  thanks a lot im going to go crazy researching the food options as im really looking forward to that aspect of the city though ill mostly go for cheaper options ill consider splurging on a fancy restaurant      thanks but wouldnt the airbnb take up my whole budget
  i dunno making a shit ton of money    thats enough for some people
get a camera and do some street photography the place has a great atmosphere and an interesting clash between civilisation and chaos     try lots of food    i only spent a week there but wished i stayed longer and would love to go back
  fyi spent about 27 days here for work over the last 2 months and i gotta say i think youll have done everything of interest within a week and a half if you get bored take a cheap flight out to taipei and spend a few days there its an incredible city if you have more time to kill travel around the island a bit they have some great sights and towns to see like jiufen old street area particularly catch a ride from the airport into taipei good scenery on the way    youll need to get visas for this so watch that
  do i have to apply for my visa before i get there how long does it last should i wait until the travel date is closer or should i apply for it asap
  where are you from a lot of countries dont need a visa for up to 30 days      also i did two day trips to shenzhen if youre into electronics and stuff check out the huaqiangbei area and the markets its a geeks wet dream be warned wandering around the markets all day wears you out heaps because theres so much to try and take in
for those familiar with both hong kong and shenzhen wheres the best place for currency exchange for rmb    i use ckm for currency exchange to hkd but i dont have any experience for rmb
  i usually browse a few kiosks in tst they are often displaying similar rates and bargain from there
  the ground floor of ck towers is generally the best place way better rates than elsewhere
ill be going on my first european trip by myself this january i havent done anything this this before out of country so im curious if there are any tips you guys can offer me in the way of staying safe in particular ill be going to london and ending in edinburgh anything i should do to prepare myself ahead of time pic not related but pretty to look at
  no  they are safe cities just act normal
  why do you pick the most retarded places to visit   good luck getting acid thrown in your face or something
  edinburgh  scotlands probably one of the most homogenous countries in the developed world
im from the uk and im considering getting a temporary job teaching english in japan or china preferably japan someone i met at a party a few weeks ago told me she applied to do a 7week course in china and it was really easy to get the job has anyone had any experience doing this what was it like    most of all im wondering which agencies are the best to go with i did camp america when i was younger and my experience with that was positive but i learned that not all agencies are equal by any means    also im not some mega weeb im just a normal 20 something who wants to visit japan but i think a 2week trip would be too expensive and leave me wanting more ideally id like to do be there for 8 weeks during the end of 2019
  look up tefl
how do you people afford traveling
  its called a job
  i cant travel if i cant barely afford to live
  yep thats life work hard for a while and save up money theres no magic answer
fuck off  
i overborrow on student loans secure in knowing that i wont have to face reality until after another ten years of postgraduate education
  i dont acquire large debts and i dont piss my extra income away on the latest toys and gadgets i save it up
  make more money
depends on your scope of travel    if youre meticulous you could travel in many places within your corner of the world on the cheap you could dedicate time to learning more about the smaller part of the world that you inhabit i know many people who have done well in life by just understanding their own pocket of the globe by traversing it    do you want to go abroad on a shoestring budget or somewhere regional and have good  to throw around or conversely abroad rarely with plenty of cash or be a travelling pleb multiple times a year    im putting in extra hours to do an adventure abroad next year put in the work and save up as a previous anon put it no magic answer a friend of mine has been to costa rica france estonia south africa vietnam nepal and japan multiple times with no backing or support just work and a total passion for travelling the world that is unless you were like that dude a few years ago who got a corporate sponsorship from some chewing gum to dance all over the world in different spots i think it was stride gum    it all comes down to time not money how much time are you willing to invest to prepare financially for travel
i live at home and try to get as many deals as possible i also dont mind staying in hostels and traveling in the off season
  dont go out drinking its a huge waste limit your putting a with friends to once a month less if you are truly are serious about traveling in a year i was able to save 20k byncutti g down all unnecessary sending no movies no frivolous meals out i disnt even miss it i went out with my mates once in a while and realized it was such a waste of time i wasnt missing much staying home
get into the stock market and for fuck sakes open a roth ira even if you dont get into stock market open a roth ira tomorrow monday we will get one of the biggest bulls sinces trump got elected that will last for 2 weeks
  if you want to put in some valuable helpful labour and experience what actual rural life is for people in the world research world wide opportunities on organic farms wwoofnet you can get lots of experience doing agricultural stuff its volunteer work but you get room and board plus valuable cultural exchange its also pretty boss on a resume i did it in japan picked strawberries and plucked bamboo from hillsides slept in a converted barn worked about four hours a day hung out with locals didnt pay a cent to be there if you live at home presumably without debt and dont have to pay rent while youre gone or sublet you can live almost costfree life is what you make of it so talk to people and see what you can mesh out set up a gig where you work to eat and sleep and learn skills as you go and get money on the side somehow to dowhatever money buys certainly helps to not be dazzled by flashy urban life and spending etc on nightlife
  although similar everybodys travel is different  break things down    flying is expensive  fly to cheaper locations / wait until a flight deal / take another mode of transportation    lodging is expensive  consider shared/alternative lodging or visit places where you have friends/friendly family    just dont have any money to get things started  go to /biz/
  why what happened
  trade war truce at g20 between xi and trump  shitload of volatility from europe as brexit mess continues protests in france continuing and other eurozone negative news which will create an outflow of capital from eu to us  and negative press about big tech subside as the sheep start to buy gifts in the christmas run up  online shopping bigger than ever  oil coming down as well    i would stay out of healthcare since d took back congress and are centering the agenda around this topic preparing for january    december will probably be a good month for us stocks
i live with my parents save money for 6 months to a year and then travel i end up saving around 1520k im only 21 and have done this already a few times since i graduated high school my next trip will probably be my last for a while i cant run away from wageslave live forever need to go to school 
let me tell you a secret most meme travellers just have rich parents another one is having a study loan while your parents pay for the most of your living some have jobs but the thing is many travellers are piss poor because they waste their money on travelling so dont worry about not being able to travel op you arent really missing on something that you cant do once you have more funds
planning to go to vegas in jan     anything noteworthy going on there to experience or try
bump
  you absolutely have to go to the pinball museum they were discussing getting a place on the strip to boost visits which would likely destroy the place in my opinion   i didnt like the strip got lost a few times    theres the grand canyon i forgot to go     little aleinn a few hours outside of vegas along with other assorted alien stops i loved it    i did a shooting package because you cant get the guns here in australia     visit the pawn stars shop from tv i didnt see them though
country gig
  pawn shop is closed
pin ball museum and the atomic testing museum are both pretty neat maybe ride the roller coaster at nyny if youre in to that kid of thing otherwise the people watching in vegas is fantastic
  why
  because it isnt
the downtown area itself is full of degeneracy so unless you want to drink/gamble avoid that even if you do want to drink/gamble at least go to fremont street where its way cheaper and more lively    anyways here are some things to do    supercar track day experience  gun shooting  some construction tractor playground thing that my friend keeps talking about  go up to mt charleston  hoover dam
some really cool shows are pretty affordable penn and teller are great next time i plan to see celine dion if you dont mind rushing it seeing the grand canyon via sightseeing flight was pretty cool
  if youve got the budget there a places you can rent exotic supercars for the day
be prepared for batches of crude lewd and pushy people god i hate vegas
go see the duelling pianos and check out the linq promenade lm
  tfw they will probably only let you drive loaders and excavators  tfw no scraper playground   tfw op will never know true joy as he leaves the seat while travelling sideways trying to turn at 25mph down a poor haul road with a smoke in his mouth 22 hours into his shift and a can of red bull hits him in the head
  can confirm the atomic museum is worth doing
someone else says why you shouldnt/should

  the fuck is a painting spree
  dunkirk to istanbul  everyone ive told has told me  amerifats or just very ignorant friends there are no major dangers on the way might want to avoid some gypsy village in romania if you are larping as borat but thats about it
  you take a bunch of painting equipment least whatever medium your comfortable with then go on the road you see something pretty or interesting you paint it or sketch it as i reach each post office ill send my paintings home and buy new paints and whatever in the different art shops in europe
  friends mostly and uni tutors and my parents desu i havent had much in the way of support but im doing it anyway because of reasons already stated

  chicago has a lot of great qualities  if they moved it about 300 miles south it would be a great city
  bruges cause its hard to avoid visiting it
  i went to the latter 2 both were amazing although i liked prague more even though it was infested with couples
  watched the film kind of feel like ive done bruges now
  thatll be why then most yorkshiremen think benidorm is exotic
  johanesbourgh and manaus
  any other cities in that region you visited that you can comment on
  wroclaw for sure
visiting rio de janeiro soon
i too want to visit naples why does everyone like it so much    i also want to visit lyon and explore small towns nearby like annecy
just got back from here and this is by far the worst place i have ever been why is this place memed as a travel destination    here are some highlights    every street and building is filthy and covered in graffiti  everything looks run down af and like its about to fall down or is literally under construction  so many shady drug dealers pestering you to buy fake gear  lots of random brazilian and angolan gangstas loitering around everywhere   actual portuguese people rude and insulting to tourists despite their city being overrun by shady excolonial folk  small section of the city semipretty all of the rest one big industrial estate and crumbling shithole     i feel safer walking around in the shitty outskirts of moscow than in barrio alto    anyone else feel the same about this place
even though i think lisbon is very nice i dont understand all the hype   i havent traveled as much as some people in this board but i would much rather go to vienna budapest or sarajevo than lisbon    tportuguese
  as a portuguese i honestly dont know  the only good place in portugal is algarve in the summer
  this is by far the worst place i have ever been  i spent a month in lisbon this year and i couldnt agree more     but lxfactory was kinda cool id highly recommend it
  i like street art   did not find the people rude at all
  this is interesting  ive seen pics of lisbon  it looks absolutely fucking gorgeous  it isnt that gorgeous in real life
  all those pics are taken from far away when you are next to the buildings you see what op mentioned the graffiti piss stains degraded walls etc
i agree porto is waaaaaaaaay better  lisbon was dirty and full of indians
    why are portuguese so utterly fucking sperg not saying you are but in general it seems everyone in lisbon is a miserable cunt     i sat down at a cafe with my grill to get a coffee and on the table next to us were two scruffy looking faggots in their 20s got chatting to them and then as they were about to leave they said hey let me teach you one thing in portuguese how to say thank you repeat after me eu laber pilha repeat    i knew it meant i suck cock so i said dude that isnt even funny epic bantz and told him to fuck off up to that point it was a decent convo the fuck is wrong with portuguese
why are you so mad that you have to post the exact same thing in 2 different boards found the problem it was you all along you stupid cunt
always wanted to travel to lisbon because beside all the touristy scenery it was advertising there was also a hot guy there that i wanted to fug  but looks like both scenarios are now out the window
  i can see it not being your thing it is in fact very dirty especially compared to other cities but saying its an unsafe place boggles my mind lived there for 8 years and walked pretty much all over town at all sorts of times of day its actually something i hear tourists say from time to time that they dont feel unsafe walking around at night
  its not that bad just avoid barrio alto    if you take the train to estoril or cascais its much nicer there
  algarve good in the summer  ah
  my thoughts exactly   ts crazy because every coworker of mine who went to lisbon just couldnt stop talking about how amazing the food and the people are how great their attitude towards life is and just how cheap everything is in lisbon  which is funny seeing how that city was much more expensive than my hometown of budapest
  had the opposite experience op yes its kinda run down compared to some european capitals but everything else i disagree with thought portuguese people were very nice the food was excellent the sights were great and felt very safe porto is great too
  lisbon is definitely dirty in a lot of places but unsafe no i felt safer there than many other european countries especially southern ones
ive been there 3 times i honestly love the place ive been to porto as well porto is cleaner and a bit more pretty but i had just a laugh in lisbon
imagine the absolute s o y b o y you have to be to feel unsafe in fucking lisbon lmao
  the is xxxx dangerous crowd are not traditional basedboys they are your runofthemill liveleak/molyneux/southern/pol hellspawn somebody has put those delusions in their heads they did not just come out of nowhere
  i wouldnt say muh liveleak and muh pol im going to lisbon this month and my boomer grandparents are freaking out saying bad shits gonna happen its just unintelligent people
  edgy fags and the city being overcrowded with tourists thats why
really fast question about ryanair voucher gifts    i have a 50 value voucher if i spend it on a flight that cost less than 50 will i get the rest of the money back  i mean if i use the voucher to pay for a 35 flight will ryanair send me another voucher with 15 inside    im asking this because the terms  conditions page on the website is not clear at all about this point im taking a plane from italy where the vouchers have been bought to spain in the italian website it says that they will give the rest of the money back by sending me another voucher on the spanish one by the way it says i will lose the money im not using    someone has some experience about that
as for me    best  1 istanbul  2 sevilla  3 plovdiv    worst  1 brussels  2 bucharest  3 paris    honourable mention to barcelona the city center has way too many tourists but the beach front area and poblenou are really nice
best  hong kong  paris  rome    worst  munich  london  honolulu
best  1 seoul  2 tokyo  3 hong kong    worst  1 london  2 paris  3 la    essentially stay out of europe
best  1 rome  2 oldenburg  3 san diego    worst  1 san francisco  2 hamburg  3 berlin
    why worst london in going on a euro trip next year and well be there like 2 days just because we never been there before do you think we are wasting precious days we could spend somewhere else
  everything repeated in this thread except for objectively shit dirt poor third world cities is completely arbitrary and based on nothing if you think you will enjoy london you will enjoy london everything that attracts people to that city is still there you like anglo history london you like food london you like shopping london you like museums london you like nightlife london i really dont understand what the people in this thread were expecting desu london has been europes fastest and constantly changing city for 200 years so it will not feel like the more architecturally historical cities and towns in europe
  wrong pic lol i dont know why the fuck i posted san diego whatever its a great city too
  to me london is fine if you wish to see it youll always find stuff to keep you busy  its extremely expensive tho so i wouldnt make a dent in my budget just to say i saw london  british countryside can be lovely too    about this thread    best  hong kong  cape town  bordeaux    worst  pattaya hellhole    no other city i visited really rubbed me the wrong way they all had redeeming qualities even la for instance while somewhat underwhelming was intersting enough so i plan on visiting again to see other aspects of it next time ill be in the region
  what did you like about bordeaux the region and city seems very interesting but i dont know much about it besides my google earth exploring how are the prices and nightlife
  i just found it incredibly alien and the people were rude they have a particular pedantic nature that makes them offputting to me still enjoyed it id say it was worth a look it just happens to be one of my least favourites    now munich is truly shit and i would not recommend it
best  hong kong  rome  budapest    worst  milan  berlin  stirling
best  hanoi  wellington  seville    worst  marrakech  london  auckland
i will rate u fags    6/10 i understand the cities you labeled worst but putting plovdiv in top 3 its nice but not that good     4/10 agree on london in the worst but putting paris which is on same level of shitholeness as london is very phatethic never been in hong kong so idk    two bowls of rice/10 ching chong ding ding dong although as i already said i agree on first two positions in worst list    7/10 i also liked rome but i wouldnt give it first place never been neither in oldenburg nor in san diego i cant say anything bad about worst list i also hate this cities    6/10 milan was not that bad i would say genoa is worse but agree i loved budapest and im happy finally someone put it in list    i also wonder why everybody put big cities on they list dont you like some small countryside places imo thyre simply better but maybe because i like silence and empty streets
  best  singapore  stuttgart  bangkok    worst  jakarta  denver   nyc
best  munich  jerusalem  bogota shitty but i had a cool time    worst  cusco  amman  manila
  i liked that the city is very walkable with thousands of foods and drinks options at a very good value for price   as often in wine regions gastronomy and drinks are big parts on the culture and i literally never walked out of a restaurant in disappointment  big students town so it feels young and lively but also very bourgeois with posh buildings grand architecture and clever city planning i was surprised as its perfectly balanced between the two  im french but had never been in bordeaux before it could easily be my favorite french big city at east as a tourist dunno if living there long time would confirm that impression
i was tempted to put paris on the list to be honest but  has a point    in no particular order    best  petrosani romania  kallaste estonia  donji milanovac serbia    worst  craiova romania  ferizaj kosovo  saranda albania
      i really and truly dont understand the hate for paris maybe it was because i went in winter so there were no crowds maybe its because my hotel was out of the tourist district i loved the museums the architecture the shopping the scenery people were lovely and friendly the food was good the only thing i didnt like was the railway system but i ended up doing most of my travelling either by boat or walking    i did have this weird experience where i felt instantly at home when i arrived in paris the only explanation i have is that my family is french removed some 400 years
  i just found it ugly i liked paris more it also has the food museums and shopping options dont know much about clubbing as i heard it was subpar but there was still tons of cool bars
  amman    is it that bad ill be there for a couple of days next week
ctrlf hong kong  6     yassss
  worst  pattaya hellhole    did you go with your girlfriend/children
  i was in paris and it was one of the best experiences in my life fuck haters it is a wonderful city

just left miskolc in hungary immediately qualifies as one of the most horrible places ive been and most untypical of hungarian provincial capitals i know lifeless joyless decaying and sullen and miserable and straight in ny three worst like kielce in poland vibewise but without the level of history and beautiful mountainous surroundings that that has and as its hungary not poland an absence of overt drunken men on the streets too but the streets just be empty conversely szeged where i was earlier might be a contender for the top three
  why did you like fuckingdonji milanovac that much    super comfy town extremely cheap no foreign tourists at all nice people all around good food and the iron gates is some of the most beautiful stuff ive ever seen
  borsodabaújzemplén has always been hungarys mordor
  i mean it wasnt that bad but in comparison to other places ive been it kind of sucked you might have a different experience though
  that looks beautiful
  srsly is hk better than tokyo
  or kyoto
  id say so  in hk theres always something interesting around every corner whether it be a restaurant temple hiking path etc i dont think theres a better place on earth to just start walking randomly because youll 100 of the time youll happen upon something cool    tokyos obviously awesome and has lots of stuff to see but its a massive sprawling city its much easier to explore hk on account of how dense it is
  i dont do lot of city travels    best  1 bonifacio corsica  2 ny ny  3 montepulciano italy technically a town but meh       worst  1 genoa italy  2 hamilton new zealand   3 west palm beach florida
  i loved london but i can see how it would really depend on who you are with and your interests its a walking city with a ton of history and cool little places to stumble upon i was with a great group of people and had two excellent locals to show us around i got lost one morning looking for good iced coffee and came across an amazing little little square of narrow winding walking roads and artisan shops and it was pretty amazing
  did you bang any girls in korea
  unless you are a weeb obsessed with japanese culture i really think hk is more lively and exciting than tokyo in fact hk turned out to be more like i expected tokyo to be choke full of people buzzing 24/7 people rushing under neon lights foods everywhere a lot less peaceful than what tokyo actually is
  i almost pucked
no amsterdam
  best  kyoto  san francisco  berlin    worst  little rock ar  oslo  london
best  barcelona  san francisco  christchurch maybe just had fun there but its not a bad place    worst  panama city  tegucigalpa  san pedro sula

  dude your literally asking this same question on every thread where korea is even mentioned    if you cant get laid at home you wont get laid elsewhere unless you pay of course
  what did you not like about okinawa and osaka
  okinawa just felt like pretty much any other city in japan shops some restaurants a shopping street with much more americanization due to the military presence theres also no decent beaches nearby one of the main draws of okinawa imo id recommend staying outside the city if youre on the island     osaka is just a worse tokyo
post about  your favorite australian bars drinks local fruits  food  interesting attractions eg the big banana in coffs  sharing a pint of vb with your m8s on friday  wwoofing in australia shearing sheep etc  getting skin cancer and sunburns  traveling to and around oz  cost of living down undah  becoming a bogan  petting koalas  dust storms  having your croc hunter fantasies crushed    dude what should i see in ________    aussie delicacies    please refrain from asking questions about prostitution although such businesses are legal in some states they are expensive and have few women available to meet the practice is generally frowned upon therefore discussing it is inappropriate
  is it legal to sleep in my car
  yes i slept in my car in melbourne for nearly a month just dont be a nuisance
  interesting in the states at least where i live if you try to do this youll be harassed constantly by cops banging on your windows and threatening to ticket you if you dont hand over id license registration insurance and the proceed escorted to a nearby hotel or by homeless people begging for change or just asking dumb questions like heywhat are you doing spare some change gimmie a lift sometimes business employees just run out the front door waving their arms frantically
  in my state you can only sleep in campgrounds qld bums and surfers park at the beach and shit the place up until the cops come and bust a whole bunch    cops in aus have a lot more authority than in the us and will literally just tell you move on for no reason refusing is illegal    also if you are sleeping drunk in your car its still drink driving even if the keys arent in the ignition
roma reporting in
  good to know i wont actually get my rental till brisbane anyway until then ill have to rely on taxis trains buses etc in sydney  i booked a badass capsule hotel in sydney looking forward to my stay there i thought only the japs had em
your favorite australian bars drinks local fruits  food    pick any pub or cafe on tripadvisor top 50 and just fuckin go aussies love 2 things craft beer and craft coffee theyre fuckin insane about that shit i felt like in the cities theyre more about breakfast and lunch and most dinner places close pretty early still on weekends around the cbd of cities like mel or syd youll find some top tier nightlife    interesting attractions eg the big banana in coffs    take a car go right on down to the great ocean road it sounds stupid but on a sunny day its fuckin incredible    sharing a pint of vb with your m8s on friday    oz guys are fuckin cunts on my second trip i was hanging out with these plumbers on a saturday evening were outside on the balcony and completely piss drunk the fuckheads start singing happy birthday saying its joshs birthday the fuckin pub sent over a round of free drinks ugh i still have a hangover thinking about it
    both mel and syd have nice public transport when youre in syd be sure to get an opal card     while mel does have passes syd does not both cities however have a daily and a weekly cap on the fare keep in mind that both cities charge like hourly fare rather than per stop like most other metro cities so if your travel is literally to the next stop you might save like 5 just walking the km    i dunno if this is still a thing but the cap on weekends is super low like 3 low so weekends are great for taking a ferry to and fro to say manly beach 30 mins ride each way
  vic has myki and theres no paper tickets at all even for a single trip they are 6 bucks for the card plus any credit you use
finally getting out of sydney aftwr working here for over half a year what a piece of shit ask anyone and theyre all here only for business or passing through even the actual sydneysiders would rather live in melbourne or whatever but are to deep in their comfort zone to leave i swear to god if the government wasnt blindly throwing money at ever proposal on their desk creating an insane amount of jobs no one come here    chinatown and the darling harbour area were ok
it doesnt sound stupid at all im from oklahoma and havent seen the ocean in years its a big deal for us i thought about bringing a drone to capture some aerial shots but i dont know what the regs are and dont want to risk losing it  thanks for the opal tip ill need it to make it to some schedule events but yeah i definitely dont mind walking especially if its less than 5 miles and i get to explore some place new
  i believe you have to fly it within eyesight or it becomes an aircraft subject to casa regulations      most of these questions are easily googled because australia is a very organised country and everything is written in english
  i know this is a troll thread but why didnt you mention that melbourne and sydney are little beijing and shanghai
  townsville  what happens there
  cyclones and boredom and i guess you can check out the great barrier reef from there
  where to
  also can confirm sydney is a shithole filled with angry people
  australian laws that have anything remotely to do with alcohol are such a massive fucking joke thanks for informing us on the law in queensland you might have saved me and others a shitload of bullshit
    its so fuckin weird state by state i cant remember where it was maybe brisbane where you cant smoke in restaurants only drink so the smoking zones in restaurants are all alcohol only no food allowed was no wonder why i cant remember where it was because i hadnt had any lunch which led to me being smashed on an empty stomach
tasmania is nice to live  shit to work in  literally no opportunities down here
    oz guys are fuckin cunts    i dont think you understand how to use the word cunt in regard to the context of the rest of your postm8
  i think all of sydney harbour is a no drone zone i seem to remember seeing a sign to that effect  also sydney sucks yes stuck here for a job i love but how i wish i was in melbourne now
how do i get a sydney wage but live in comfy tasmania
  who got it
  wishful thinking and/or be highly qualified in an indemand field
  is adelaide worth a stop
  syd  top tier night life    i wish this were true  lockout laws absolutely murdered any nightlife that existed in cold blood
why are sydney and melbourne so expensive lads
  if you go to the heart of the city they are but go a suburb or two out and its not
  we get paid pretty well you can have a shit retail job here with no education and still earn 25 per hour
  r u a power puff girl
  nope what things interest you if its music food arts culture then go to melbourne if its beaches and waves then theres plenty of that on the east coast of oz theres plenty of nature as well spread out through the counntry adelaide doesnt have much
  because of supply and demand    sydney and melbourne have the big businesses  big businesses mean big money jobs  everyone wants big money jobs  everyone wants to live close to the big money jobs  high competition for real estate to access the big money jobs pushes prices up  high demand for goods and services due to high concentration of big money people with aforementioned jobs drives those prices up  everyone wants their own house in the end not just a unit  this leads to development of outerlying lands into residences resulting in higher commute costs and times    it doesnt help that everyone in this country seems to have a boner for having a detached home with a backyard for the kinds of populations that melbourne and sydney have and which theyre projected to get a transition towards efficient ultrahighdensity living is needed instead of perpetuating this suburban sprawl     that and spreading out the major industries a bit more so that smaller regional cities can develop into bigger cities and absorb some of the growth that normally gets directed at the big two
  you can make that in the boonies with a 2/10 job
  adelaide is fucking boring as fuck  fuckall is out there  t qld niqqa
  be highly qualified in an indemand field  balls  wishful thinking  yep
  good pla will never happen under the libs  were still in a daze and day dream that the australian way of life is different now than in the 80s  fucking boomers and genx shits
      you do realise two thirds of their population growth is due to immigration and that doesnt even count the the immigrants having babies in reality it doesnt help that every man and their dog requires an investment property on top of extremely high immigration
    expect this to drop over the coming years
    i cant speak for melbourne but as a general rule people like to live places that are comfy
  shearing sheep  why not pick fruit   travel to various farms and speak with employers directly   introduce yourself at stalls at farmers markets   contact farms over the phone   search and apply for farm jobs online   dont be a worthless lazy arse    try fruitbook just choose a a fruit then pick no bullshitbetter than facebok
    maybe im jaded because every day i work some cunt tries to speak mandarin to me or maybe im jaded and need to get out of the city     this country has been sold out to the chinese no matter how you look at it its fukn depressing
    sure maybe in the very populated areas at the end of the day chinks all slanty eyes make up about 4 of the overall population australia has also approved a record low of visa applications in 2018 i think itll stay like this or decrease even further for the next few years at least
    yeah like i said probably just jaded from the inner city
  why not pick fruit  because why be a lessthanminimumwagecuck on piece rate fruit picking is truly one of the worst regional jobs you can have
  is it illegal to hitchhike i plan on backpacking around for a bit ive hitchhiked before but im not sure if its illegal or not ive heard its a grey area anybody done it
as a resident its an awesome country to live and work but youd be silly to travel here for short 1 month trips if youre seeking value for money    food alcohol transit accommodation and attraction admission are very expensive     the most feasible way to travel here is to come for a few months and try to line up some cafe/ bar work and find a room in a sharehouse when i worked at a restaurant the italians and brazilians who got paid cash earned 18 or 13usd an hour if you have the appropriate visa and get put on the books it was 23 16usd     as the other anon says dont fall for fruit picking meme and bust your ass all day for peanuts
  because why be a lessthanminimumwagecuck on piece rate  perhaps because not everyone had connections to get a good job quickly or access to daddys money and we have to scrap for our travel fun    i dont know if its illegal but i never considered it because during certain times of the year it could be suicide in some places
  is australia still the best place to enjoy drum  bass
what is the superior aussie airline  qantas or virgin australia  unlike in peoples lives going virgin seems to have many advantages
  what is the best city in australia if you could only visit one
    come to brisbane  gold coast the beaches on the southern end of the gold coast are some of the best in the country and the spots i swim are deserted during the week    go to sydney if you want to see some overrated landmarks  hordes of chinese
    when youre in syd be sure to get an opal card     this isnt true anymore the state gov has changed the system so you can just use card now any visa/mastercard will work
  so they record your acct   nice someone pitch this to them as a means to cut down on plastic waste
  the same way you live in arkansas but earn a san francisco wage
  fakking unlucky m8
hey /trv/ i just bought my easter holiday tickets im flying to paris and immediately taking a train to reims from the airport ideas on what to do in reims and the champagne area my idea is to visit  metz  laon  epernay  verdun if i can find an easy way to get there    im into art history in general and wwi and wwii history in particular literature checking out lots of champagne finding chill bars listening to suggestions thx
  there is a flixbus route going from reims to verdun but it only goes once a day iirc  what do you plan on doing in epernay
any good hidden gems on this path im planning
heres the return path
are you doing this soon going to sioux falls  id suggest i 70 for the rockies but i get this time of year driving in the mountains might be unnerving  arches in utah  theres a missile launch site in white sands new mexico that does regular testing
  going to phoenix by car and return to sf by car just want to know what i can do on the way there its for christmas
wanting to go back to sioux falls  but why
  that stretch of kansas/oklahoma is going to feel about 10 times longer than it really is
  because i live here
update the return path a bit going through flagstaff before heading to new mexico
no offense to anyone who lives in those places but that is without a doubt the most boring part of the country the only place that is remotely interesting on that route is lawrence kansas try and catch a basketball game i guess    your drive back is much better drive through gila national forest its gorgeous     honestly if i were you i would take your route back one way and the other way i would go up through flagstaff by the grand canyon up through utah maybe stop at zion and either take 70 through colorado or go all the way up to yellowstone and catch up with 90 in wyoming    i cant think of something i would like to do less than drive northsouth through nebraska kansas oklahoma and texas
  essentially this do this
  yellowstone top left corner of wy will be pretty much closed in the winter op so keep that in mind
  but why
san antonio has the best tex mex in the country and you can walk over to jaurez for a peek at how the other side lives other than that its a terrible route
  take a detour in texas and cut over to carlsbad nm and check out the cavern its pretty fucking neat also dallas has all sorts of shit to do in it depending on what you want to do    if youre just traveling for christmas though youd probably spend less by flying rather than driving and staying in hotels
update ive had to change because of a job opportunity i might have a job opportunity to work for an airline
  continued
    basically need to take a detour to atlanta and then go to phoenix
on your return path cut through colorado and through the 4 corner region skip the monument but that entire area of sw colorado is great for adventures grand canyon is closeby too
go to the badlands in south dakota its my favorite national park
  been there and i enjoyed it
  because i moved here with my parents when i was a kid
  youre spot on about kansas but north south through oklahoma and texas is good driving op will want to blow his brains out driving from abilene to el paso tho
  eat at the whataburger in canton tx go in and sit see the people get a monterrey melt this place is like a time machine its what texas used to be before every fag in california decided to move there
hello fellow sioux falls anons
  why canton
  despite being a corporate chain the whataburger there will give you a small town vibe from a side of texas that doesnt exist near the bigger cities anymore
    bro you should just fly at this point 66 hours of driving is miserable
    i used this website on many trips love it
  i live in lawrence ks    go to allen fieldhouse
  the atlante legs are going to be boring driving
planning to take trip to africa this summer looking to hear experience/advice from people who either went to egypt or tanzania    not sure which i want to do yet but i plan to go with a travel group egypt seems cool to do but im not sure if its the best to do alone i plan going with a tour group but still technically doing this alone tanzania would be cool too but i feel like it would just feel like taking a trip to the zoo     any advice would be cool these werent ever my first choices to want to travel to i mainly want to travel to japan someday but would rather wait until i am settled in a career so i can have a better experience and not have to be so cheap with my options     really need this trip though broke up with long term gf and just feel the need to go out and travel somewhere kind of leaning towards egypt but would like to hear from you guys to see which would be a better choice
  you can save money on airfare and petrol by simply taking an inflatable raft all the way down up the nile into africa just toss out a sandbag with a rope onto the banks in some remote place when you get near to where you want to stop then follow handheld gps into town come back to the raft hop in and then proceed to next destination youll end in lake tanzania then you can sell your boat and fly back home
  sounds like a foolproof plan ill heavily consider it
i have never been to either but i think tanzania would give you more of an african feel since egypt is almost the middle east     if you do pick egypt you could also swing by jordan and see petra although that might get pricey
  yeah still thinking about it i feel a little more towards tanzania just to be able to do some physical activity stuff like hiking and swimming    i still kind of feel like egypt would be better to go with a friend or someone
  its not a bad one unlike the mississippi in the us there are fewer dams locks and civil engineering bullshit in the way
  what about crocodiles an hippos
been to egypt two months ago  what you need to understand is that after all the revolutions and shit their economy is sunk and tourists are their gold you wont be able to go anywhere without anybody offering you services for a buck and security stopping you from going anywhere due to terrorist threats you will be babysat  also keep in mind that tipping is a way of life in egypt and everybody wants a piece if you glance at somebody they will want a tip i was bleeding money solely because of tips and you actively have to tell people to fuck off because they are like a ravenous mob  i do advise however to look up emo tours online they organize a tour guide and car to take you around select places of interest and are quite hospitable i honestly dont think i could have done a tour through egypt with all the hassle if it wasnt for them
  lol im in egypt right now youre a fucking pussy i went from cairo to aswan to luxor and back to cairo by myself through all the tourist spots the baksheesh ghosts are plentiful yea but if you need a fucking tour group youre either elderly or a pussy straight up lol
  lol lol lol  so youre a retard ok
  no lol i did it to piss you off im glad to see it worked
  weird youre not me im the one who called him a pussy lol    but really it isnt hard to navigate egypt alone youll be fine live a little
how can i find a job abroad /trv/     25 years old white blond hair blue eyes   masters degree not in stem unfortunately  not that much work experience  speak german english spanish hueportuguese fluently    any idea where to start looking i dont want to become rich i just want to live abroad in a tropical country for some time im ok with teaching feminism to indians in the jungles of honduras or exporting gold from brasil give me anything and ill do it not a native anglo so no teaching for me
  you got an impresive curriculum for someone who wants to be a bum so you obviously want an adventure while traveling kind of thing if you got good social skils you can basically go to any tropical country and talk your way into spurious meaninless jobs that will provide you with some adventure and some cash for the minimum things like food making conections with people a long the way is the key here i could recomend you aruba because is safe beautiful and friendly  in any case social skils is the key is you want a good traveling adventure
  german your first language get a teaching degree goetheinstitute all over the world give german classes some contrarian thirdworlders actually go for german before english
go work on a cruise ship you can travel to many places and your ability to speak many different languages will come in handy you will meet many different people from all over the world the pay is mediocre but your food and living expenses will all be taken care of
  poor bastards my step brother majored in german and then learned germans all know english already
  i know anon i met plenty of them the problem is that the goethe institut have that market completely cornered unless i get a 6 year degree no teaching for me       i traveled plenty so im not looking for that just want a city close to the beach and a job thats pretty much it
  get some job experience or marketable skills   get a higher education  develop contacts with locals that can hook you up with a job  work a shit job that requires none of the above     so basically just the same as you would in your home country if you speak several languages you can easily work in hospitality even with no previous experience hotels are always on the look for multilingual people and some of them may even provide accomodation just figure out when the high season starts and get there a couple weeks erlier to maximise your chances i know that you could easily do this in ibiza if you arrive in earlymid may for instance and probably in many other touristic destinations in spain
  hes actually eligible to work as an international host since he knows the minimum amount of languages 4 its a pretty comfy job you basically organise and lead social gatherings and translate the cruise director pa announcements    he could also work reception my line gets 22k a month but you gotta have a roommate
tfw have two bachelors degrees and a masters   tfw partway through phd   tfw would love to live abroad but dont want to work a tardtier job like receptionist or host or engrish teacher
  surely if you have a masters and you speak the language you can work and research in a foreign country in your field
  aruba is a first world country and part of the netherlands how the hell is that a genuine consideration
is this really how american women generally behave in the warmer parts of the us    im guessing this is some college town in florida or california    
    for black guys no shit    white women worship the ground their black feet walk on    and you would too if you had black fingers savagine your clit black tongue in your ass black dick railing your pussy stupid    big black dick is no fucking joke in america    once you bring it into a white womans life its all shell think about that shit is like drugs    its hotter than the fucking sahara with drugs too    ive been to a dozen swinger parties where married white women get spun as kites and then come onto black guys for the first time    holy fuck    that shit is god    you can feel a fraction of her pleasure in every scream with bbc in her guts    fuck what society thinks or 4chan or anybody else    black dick rules so do the nasty fucking sluts it creates    and so does meth my divk twitches every time i see some freaky ass milf or college girl blow her first smoke with the pipe its like fucking mind control except youre brainwashing yourself and bbc is insanely fucking addictive with that shit
so is this florida
  big black dick is no fucking joke in america  once you bring it into a white womans life its all shell think about that shit is like drugs
  black fingers savagine your clit black tongue in your ass black dick railing your pussy stupid    u wot m8
  is this pasta
  id enjoy watching someone carve that kike nose off your face
  what does this have to do with travelling
    its a thread asking about what people are like in a certain country/region
  is this really how american women generally behave in the warmer parts of the us    no this is how hey we are filming a comedy tv show can you spare a moment of your time goes people turn into mental retards usually the minute someone says they will be on tv or at least half their iq
     
  im the op and im planning a vacation soon im researching countries and specific regions and im trying to get a feel for what the people are like there
  some of the stuff was clearly said for the sake of comedy those dumb sluts at the end would obviously never be able to handle a 12 or 13 inch cock but there is no doubt that college chicks these days definitely love black men    i dont know why but on most college campuses in america the average black guy is lean athletic and eve noticeably muscular the average white guy is pudgy and slightly overweight
  american women are fucking scum desu    t american
  thats a generalization
  im triggered
  this black guys were chick magnets for sure and were always fit or at least skinny yet attractive white guys could get some too but you had to be at least 511 and semi attractive to compete at thwir level i had 4 black roommates whose only goals were getting women they were successful in orgies and other sexcepades wed be walkin thru campus and theyd just hollar at a hotty 50 ft away for their number and theyd walk up give it to em
mods help   my ears
  so progressive so tollerant
  no its not they are shit tier i hate women here they expect everything but dont even hold themselves to the same standards they also are not loyal
  american    you should see how german women have thrown themselves all over black american soldiers stationed in germany since 1945 and still do
  t incel
  were full though
make thread asking about cultural differences between china korea and japan  janitor deletes it  this thread is still up  janitors and mods are fucking faggots
    here in florida women who date outside of their race are chided and typically ended up as fat single mothers with mixedrace children which is something no one wants
  make thread asking about cultural differences between china korea and japan    what a stupid thread almost everything is culturally different about them you stupid fuck no wonder your thread was deleted you dumb piece of shit
  dude white women are made for bbc lmao  yeah so much better
  think you are looking for  my man
  that would be a thread for /int/

    us /trv/ler here if anyone wants to know more about any of these places ill be lurking was a 2 week trip that cost about 3000 at most i went with 3 other people and an infant    paris  people are super rude everything is expensive would probably not go back    amsterdam  best place on earth considering selling everything i own and moving there nicest people super interesting culture/vibe weed mushrooms hookers everywhere and socially acceptable 30 bikes for every 1 car at least    berlin  plain modern city everything that wouldve been interesting to see if now an expensive condo building german food is worse that prison food    athens  3rd worldy all of the old monuments were definitely worth seeing but there isnt much else all of the locals i met hate living here    santorini  3rd worldy island the nice white buildings you see on the coastline all over instagram are just from the super small tourist tip of the island the rest of the island is basically desolate volcanic sand amazing place to relax and drink on the beach for a weekend but not much else to do reminds me of catalina island but less modern conveniences     rome  worth seeing beautiful city would go back there was more to do and see than i had time or budget for    venice  most beautiful place ive ever seen no cars you can only get around by walking or boat would be an amazing vacation spot super romantic scenery fun bars with foreigners from all over interesting culture
hay guys ive been running like a headless chicken all over a whole continent those 2 nights including half a day wasted in transportation surely gave me a deep and unique knowledge of native culture as a matter of fact i didnt name a single building attraction or historical site but believe me mushrooms and whores are the only season to ever set a foot in places like amsterdam and bikes so random lol gotta have tons of selfies on my instagram    oh man rome was so nice i wish i had more time to go on holiday while on holiday
    lmfao  amsterdam check out the arcade hotel your room comes with 2 random consoles and the whole building is filled with floor to ceiling video games you can take to your room to play theres also a game room with about 4 top of the line pcs and any console you could ever want to play and a bar with cheap 5 shots of anything    heineken museum was fun its their 2nd brewery location ever and the whole thing has a bunch of interactive games and things to do    anne frank haus you can only visit if you buy a ticket online and the line is huge but if thats your thing then definitely check it out    at any of the weed cafes they mix tobacco in with their prerolled joints so if that isnt your thing buy and roll your own    mushrooms and whores are great    what historical site would you like to know about rome theres a ton my guy you can actually do a lot in a small amount of time if you plan your days
  amsterdam  best place on earth considering selling everything i own and moving there nicest people super interesting culture/vibe weed mushrooms hookers everywhere and socially acceptable 30 bikes for every 1 car at least    and this is why expats and tourists outnumber locals 5 to 1    everyone i know that went to amsterdam wanted to permanently live there
nicest people  what every time i ate at a restaurant or been in a local shop all the dutch people had that fuck off vibe  i remember being in a shop for less than 2 minutes and the guy who worked there told me to buy something or leave  wasnt loud drunkhigh or anything like that too  the only nice dutch people i met were the nonwhite ones
  yeah i just came back myself and it made me realise just how shit the uk is to live in why exactly are whores and light drugs illegal what is the explanation it works just fine in the dam i kinda wanna move there but i doubt theyd let me in especially after brexshit which will also make travelling there more difficult and expensive   looking on hamburg next does that compare to amsterdam at all
  this if you take a second to decide on something they get angry as fuck
another parisians are rude meme post  i have been to paris many times and never experienced this
why do you shit on the food in berlin but not amsterdam dutch food is objectively the worst in europe you need to eat ethnic there
  dont think there even is original dutch restaurants in the dam
  dutch food isnt the best but german is waaaay worse
op went to paris saying  hey how are ya and got the treatment we all knew he would get ive been to paris a million times each time as a midlly overweight american but since i make an albeit pathetic attempt to speak the language i have always been treated well france is ridiculously polite if you bother to adhere to their very basic rules     i dont know how you got the impression berlin is filled with expensive condos its cheap as hell and quite a shithole all the rich germans are living in frankfurt hamburg or munich travelling with an infant to berlin is probably not a great idea though and wtf the food in berlin is incredible how the hell as an american did not enjoy the street food capital of europe
  i dont know how you got the impression berlin is filled with expensive condos  its cheap as hell    its not 2003 anon a studio in scruffy neukölln costs way more than 100k euro if that is cheap then by all means its cheap
  i think its the same guy who made up that story before about berlin food being shit he got all buttmad when called out on it theres plenty of good cheap food in berlin that he didnt say anything about food in amsterdam puts doubt on his entire story
  op here when i was in berlin i made it a point to find authentic german food yelped the best place i could find and it was literal slop boiled sasuages with ketchup on top lol wtf is that shit    amsterdam i actually had amazing food the first night i had this pasta with boar meat in it and it was fire another day i had some lasagna that was top tier i didnt eat anywhere that had bad food but i guess i wasnt looking for dutch cuisine didnt even know that was a thing    all in all when the trip was said and done i can say with confidence that usa steals every cultures food and makes it 10x better probably with all the fatty shit they put in it    in italy for example i was expecting to have some pretty good pasta and pizza but it actually wasnt that great the pasta is literally just noodles with sauce on it but in the us itd be loaded up with meats and veggies as well    pizza is served uncut and its really hard to eat but its alright once you finally hack it into edible pieces    maybe my expectations were just too high because food in the us is so much better
  usa steals every cultures food and makes it 10x better probably with all the fatty shit they put in it  on the sole provision that you grew up with/regularly indulge in everything being prepared with the aforementioned fatty shit if that isnt the case and you live on a diet of fresh/minimally processed food the usa may very well become the land of gastroenteritic discomfort  it was for me if i ate out chances of ending up with digestive discomfort were significantly higher than when eating african or asian roadside street food
  pasta and lasagna are italian not dutch as your image suggests of course you can find good food anywhere if you eat at ethnic restaurants    complaining about having to cut the slices of a pizza yourself is definitely a new one for me theyd probably cut for you if you asked though theyd look at you like youre disabled    overall it sounds like youre basing your opinion of a countrys cuisine over one or two meals for country which i guess is necessary with 2 nights per city but still doesnt make sense
  there werent any blatantly dutch restaurants in amsterdam and we didnt seek any out seemed like everything was ethnic  have you ever tried cutting a crispy pizza with a butterknife on a small table its annoyingly difficult it wouldnt be bad if they gave you like a pizza cutter or something designed to cut a pizza but to get a whole pie and then have to cut it up yourself with a butterknife doesnt really make a lot of sense why not serve food ready to eat its like ordering mashed potatos but getting a baked potato and being told to mash it yourself you could but why
  blatantly dutch restaurants  you missed out on febo then    pizza  pie  cant be both please stay over there in the future
  did you happen to see any argentine steakhouses
  did the 3000 include airfare  about how much did you spend on hotels
  this is just a lot of pleb tier opinions and i suspect this thread is just one giant hunk of bait
  yea from california to paris roundtrip was about 900 then i spent about 400 for a eurail pass and then another couple hundred for the flight to and from santorini    mostly stayed at airbnbs only a couple hotels we split it between the 3 of us but i think i ended up spending average about 50/night      not bait real opinions i am pleb
how do the other dutch cities compare to amsterdam
  land of gastroenteritic discomfort  slow high five    i always instantly get stomach issues in the usa not the fat actually too much glucofructowhatever syrup like they literally put sugar in every type of bread i feel like a fucking health freak in the usa i have to read all labels and drill waiters on the menu every single time unless i want to get sick and fat like the first time i spent a few weekz there
  all that in two weeks  dude i doubt you had time to really see those places or to enjoy them
  hahahaha spot on
  i saw and enjoyed a lot of things if youve ever spent 2 days in a single place and were unable to enjoy yourself then youre doing something wrong
  berlin is the city that is closest to the feeling of amsterdam but its not close amsterdam is a very unique city and nothing really comes close to that mixture of comfortlaid back yet party feeling it has
  its a metropolis and one of the cities with the densest populations and also a tourist haven a store looking full can result in lost revenue as new potential customers decide to not enter    another thing is that its normal in dutch culture to decide exactly what to buy before you enter a store some rude dutchies forget that that is not the norm abroad where people see shopping as a form of entertainment
  berlin is ass and has 0 in common with amsterdam amsterdam definitely has a unique vibe that ive never seen anywhere else come close to
  the experiences you had on your cookiecutter yurop trip have no value whatsoever for anyone but yourself  you are an arrogant faggot for thinking you are in a position to share knowledge about these places

    this
is this idea of mine feasible or am i insane    going to china this summer  will be there the same time school/university is out for summer  will be me my wife and my brother  want to find an english student to be our translator  would pay for all of their rooms/board/transportation/food  wouldnt want to pay them a wage as i figure a free vacation with 3 weeks of talking to native english speakers would be enough    is this plausible or have i lost touch with reality i went to china once before with a close friend of mine who was chinese and the complete lack of english there was amazing i feel like i would be missing out on a ton if i did not have a native speaker with me
  thats retarded    learn about 200 chinese words and youll be fine     all public signs are in secondary english
  when i was in china i saw zero english
  when and where    i got back 2 months ago there is english literally everywhere many shop names are only in englis albiet stupid names they think sound cool
  2012     wuhan  harbin  nanjing  xian  shanghai  beijing     but i was with a friend who lived there so its possible he kept me away from the white areas
  well i first went in 2017 and i can assure you there is no shortage of english and i have been to those cities    i am talking about signage mainly road signs and things like train station will be in english    bus stations arent usually but you only need to match the characters with where you want to go     if youre truly stuck just ask any young and educated looking person theyll likely be a student and therefore have basic english as its required for university enough to tell you where to go     hell just use a translator on your phone     travel isnt difficult anymore someone always speaks english or you can always use your phone
  shanghai  beijing     what english is all over especially they airports and public transportation areas       also your idea is fucking retarded for various reasons  good chance you get ripped off and get shit talked  you can download offline google translate for most things      youre better off booking airbnb events than anything more often than not most asians like to practice english on people learn like 50 core phrases and you should be fine
  i think youre underestimating how advantageous a personal translator can be i went to russia about 5 years ago and had a great time however i went there last year with my sister and her husband who is russian and it was a completely different experience
  most people i know would probably want to be paid but its possible i guess  chinese salaries arent huge so paying them might be ok anyway you could pay them about 4k rmb for 3 weeks i guess if theyre not a professional translator and they werent going to be working anyway
  this
  i think youre underestimating how advantageous a personal translator can be i went to russia about 5 years ago and had a great time    are you the machine
  i dont get this reference at all
  my wife
  good it was stupid
where can i hire a guide that isnt older id prefer someone around my age in their 20s
  i got it made me smile
    
  just use tinder
  wouldnt want to pay them a wage as i figure a free vacation with 3 weeks of talking to native english speakers would be enough  lmao you fucking kike no ones going to take that deal youve gotta pay translators
  if he pays them would he still be expected to pay for their rooms and travel
  yes what are they going to pay to work for him

going for a honeymoon both of us floridafags  want to go skiing/snowboarding eat good food experience a little bit of the dudeweed shit too i smoke wifey not so much but might take a tiny puff after her body is btfo from winter sports so any top notch recreational dispensaries that have an experience would a welcome recommendation along with ski spots good for beginners places to eat and stuff to do in the big city i wouldnt mind doing something on snowmobiles either but i thought it might get a little pricey on top of skiing not sure though     ill be in denver for a couple of days then in the granby area but i rented a little fj cruiser form turo for getting the state around unrestricted     also thanks /trv/ for the advice on the trip that i asked her to marry me on lol
if you go to boulder eat at the tajikistani restaurant one of the coolest dining establishments ive ever been in
  you should definitely drive there i cant imagine why youd experience any trouble and its always nice to have a car for convenience
  congrats man wish you both the best  barolo grill in is one of the best restaurants ive ever been to i can very much recommend it
  if you have not gotten married yet anon please take just a moment before you throw your life in the toilet  at minimum get a prenup
  i work a lot so being away for ten days is already asking for an arm and a leg it boils down to the extra time driving would take and buying snow tires and putting them on
  i want to have children not be one
  does that mean you cant ask for a prenup  if she is going to love you forever why cant she sign one
  because shes a good girl who browses /pol/ like you
  /pol/  no  i am a mgtow monk from /out/  i would never hang out in /pol/
  i understand the why of mgtow and i dont think its totally invalid but i trust this person please dont worry about it i say this in good faith as someone who is very self aware of what happens around him /pol/ posts plenty of mgtow material too so dont act so smug lol the state of modern women is bad there is no denying that but my situation is an outlier my whole family adopted this girl pretty much its wholesome my dude with that out of the way would you like to contribute to this thread
  would you like to contribute to this thread  ok anon as luck would have it  i do a lot of business in denver   downtown denver is known as lodo back when i was a pua i would stay in an upscale hostel called hostelfish  very youthful but nice with a bar with travelers from all over the globe and the midwest  cheap drinks and great conversation if you want any feeling of community on your honeymoon this is one of the few places in denver that will let you be a part denver is a cliquish lonely place but in a fun way  get one of the very few private rooms  these are expensive but very cool and a floor above the rest of the people  it is near everything cool in lodo  coors field  16th street mall and there is a top notch dispensary 50 feet away    the food in denver is not great not bad mind youuntil you get to 100 dollars a plate level then it gets very good indeed have at least one expensive meal    drive your rental through rocky mountain arsenal dont blow this off its free and very cool   another anon mentioned dushanbe teahouse it is worth the drive and you probably dont have a place like this in florida   the coors tour is more fun than you would think and you get three free beers and you get to see how many beers you think are independent are actually made by coors you get your pick of all sorts also golden is a much cooler town than boulder if you have blue collar sensibilities  drive up to nederland and poke around  lunch there is colorado pizza or really good nepalese drive up through boulder and back through blackhawk for the prettiest drive   stay off i70 on friday afternoons      good luck in your marriage  i wish i could be as sanguine about your odds
  oh and i forgot  denver is the city where scooters are working out the best get the lime or byrd app and make an afternoon of it if the weather permits dangerous as fuck though  but you are not risk averse so it will be fun
  in orlando we have a lot of cool dining places so i wouldnt go that far but the tajikistani place looks amazing and we do like tea so thats a definite anything else note worthy in boulder i saw a few game restaurants that sounded pretty good too any quick run down on those and i did get a off road manual for a reason though im surprised no one here has talked about turo before getting to pick your carand transmission and looking like a local seems to be a huge advantage about the hostel thou we already booked our airbnbs since places were filling up stupid fast thanks you for your post its packed with great info ill relflect back to
  bump 4 more
  colorado native stonerfag here   dont drive here especially not from florida   the green dragon dispensaries are top notch in value and quality get a weed vape theyre very discreet you can puff that shit at the movies and no one complains take it easy with the edibles though like 15 mg a day each easy   get some steaks at columbine steakhouse  stay on the ski trail   be careful about elevation sickness  idk what else to tell ya enjoy your cool and comfy colorado trip anon ama i guess
  rocky mountain arsenal  yeah being able to drive around a park with a big herd of bison and the denver skyline and rockies in the background is pretty cool   commerce city actually has really decent mexican food too   get some pastor tacos floridanon
dont forget op to gift your left over smoke to the homeless before going to the airport
  sorry i havent replied to anyone in a few days i actually was wondering if there are any cheaper restaurants for messy quick food around the city i found tons of expensive places and ill be going to a lot of them but i need to balance it out a bit i was thinking about skiing in the grandby area any thoughts also i already got my plane tickets fuck buying winter tires im gonna borrow a fj cruiser when i get there so im good to drive where ever and thanks for the dispensary suggestion too
  we only have ricans here so im pretty excited to try some good mexican food rocky mountain arsenal sounds like a good place for a picnic in the tail gate pham
  go get a navajo taco at tacobe  curry at little bijou   lots of great greasy breakfast diners   mccoys  red rooster  and columbine steak house for the cheapest mexican steak in town  steak is cooked to order and pretty good the salad is iceberg  there is a potato and toast  weird but interesting place and a tbone is like 15 bucks
  if youre cool to drive wherever go someplace actually known for its skiing unlike granby i would personally recommend glenwood springs the hot springs pools are legitimate pools filled with piping hot water heated by the earth you can swim laps while its freezing out or just enjoy the warm water with your honey on the shallow end their amusement park is pretty good i would unironically give aspen a visit too they even have a green dragon there     mccoys and red rooster are cool but breakfast king is where its at
  petes kitchen is also a denver staple its especially great when youre drunk as fuck at 2 am and want breakfast
  well i sorta already booked near granby if not the towns resort then what about winter park looks like a pretty big one but i really dont know much when it comes to ski/snowboard places     another bangin post thanks friend really needed some good breakfast places whats the exact red rooster though i get one was north near longmont and one around denver that was red rooster cafe
  cafe on washington  its a cross between an old east coast greek cafe and colorado mexican   come hungry af or be prepared to split something with you female  the portions are mental  stay away from the white gravy though get green chile instead
what week in february for your sake i hope the 22nd or later    as far as less expensive food just yelp that shit
  really needed some good breakfast places  snooz its a chain but that doesnt matter its fucking decadent
going to cuzco peru on the 1st of march to do the inca trail   has anyone done it before     i wanted to do it in february but its closed for conservation   i have a few questions   1 the price on the website  sets the price at 600usd which is way too much money for me a colombian is there a way to do it without paying   2 if no do i reaaaally have to book a tour operator  or i can get there and do the trek on my own   3 its rainy season in march how bad can it get 
  1 no  2 you cant do it on your own as far as i know there are agencies that give you more freedom but you still have to pay for a guide  3 really bad i did it in the beginning of may and it rained the first two days really miserable the last two days it was sunny and the experience was amazing
thanks man really helpful    and is there any other trek that might be as spectacular but less expensive 
  it really depends on what you are looking for as far as i recall there is the salcantay trail which takes 5 days or so and is more spectacular from the landscape point of view it also gets to a higher altitude but it does not have any ruins    then lares trek which is more a cultural kind of trek also without ruins    both treks end up in the machu picchu but not directly unlike the inca trail so its best to arrange something with an agency so they coordinate if you dont want the hassle but im pretty sure you could do it independently    tldr     inca trail  not possible without agency includes ruins goes directly to the machu picchu    salcantay trek  spectacular landscapes possible to be done independently higher altitude doesnt reach mp    lares trek  cultural trek doesnt reach mp
    that said if you dont really need to go to the mp there are plenty of treks around check espiritu pampa choquequirao etc
  plenty of treks around  yeah and the good thing is the classic inca trail is only regulated one all other treks including salcantay and lares arent they are free so you can go on your own if you desire  my sister did the ausangate trek and really liked it she paid an agency though      theres an alternative route in a section of the salkantay trail which passes trough incan ruins of llactapata but i believe most tour agencies dont choose that route i guess you could do a little research beforehand    also there are some small inca ruins in lares trek but thats it
also op the landscape in the most of the peruvian andes changes between the rainy season summer in the southern hemisphere and the dry season winter the dry season has the advantage of clear sunny days and is more safe due to landslides becoming rarer but its also the busiest as is the peak season personally i like more the rainy season because is greener on average the misty scenery becomes more common and it gives mystical aspect but it can aslo become a problem there are days or even weeks were you cant see an inch of sky or any tall mountain snowfalls can happen any time of the year but they are more common in the rainy season paradoxically since its supossely the summer season i guess it happens because theres more water in the rainy season
  ive done a bit of research and the salcantay would be the best ratio quality/price in case i pay for it  but if dont do you know if i can just take a bus to the start of the trail and walk solo  or there isnt any bus just agencies cars   cause ive done a few treks in huaraz and arequipa and there isnt any public transportation service      how important are waterproof clothes in this season  i have gore tex shoes and a waterproof jacket but they recommend waterproof pants as well what you think       you sure salcantay doesnt reach macchu picchu   pic related
  just buy a pair of poncho style pants at the dollar store
i did the salkantay trek really one of the most mediocre treks ive done in my life    you walk up to the salkantay mountain pass which is absolutely gorgeous and after that its just shit walking on the side of the road     i wish i wouldve taken the train to machu picchu and done choquequirao on my own or spent more time in huaraz    also dont go in rainy season op these high mountains are always full of clouds and you dont want to be the idiot that went there and didnt see anything
  for the salkantay i paid 150 for example in 2016 for 5 days
  fuck the inca trail do salkantay pass its way better and you can do it on your own

  whats with the love for lima
mantova italy  hong kong hong kong  london england  new york usa  budapest hungary  odessa ukraine  paris france  bologna italy  st petersburg russia  ferrara italy
boston ma home  new york ny  montreal qc  florianopolis brazilamazing  bogota colombia surprisingly nice  manchester by the sea ma  island of aruba
  lima the fuck
    i loved lima i stayed in a very nice area filled with some of the best restaurants ive ever eaten in for a quarter of the price you would get them in europe the historic center was pretty nice too and i found the city pretty alien compared to everywhere id been before so it really stuck with me mainly though it was the food it also had some cool bars      i went there years ago so it could be higher if i was there more recently its a gorgeous place felt safe too you could wander for days and still not know anything about it the markets and street food are great too plus its a good place to go to the dessert or travel to a beach area      manchester is this because of the film or is there a reason
  i actually just came back from peru a couple days ago lima was definitely a lowlight for the trip sure its a culinary hotbed but the city itself was just so deprived of anything else didnt feel like another country until i got to cusco miraflores feels so commercial and barranco felt like it was trying too hard with the street art   ill give you the points on the cost of living though    interesting to hear another side
  but naples is terrible
  whats so terrible about it beautiful food gritty fee with beautiful architecture low number of tourists the locals are a lot more relaxed/friendly compared to northern italy as they have less to be snobby about good bars good shopping and easy travel to other places eg the amalfi coast/capri/rome      i stayed in barranco very clean and safe ye it was pretty trendy but it was worth it for the food and relaxed feeling the other side of the city is definitely more peruvian but i agree it is a bit more of a global feeling city also i could be biased because i arrived in lima after a week in havana so i was delighted to have creature comforts and reminders of major cities at home personally i felt cusco felt a little fake still really liked it though
  naples is many things intensely atmospheric and overladen by a sense of history and stubborn regional pride maybe above all not cosy sure but a bit of tension in the air and a lot of dirt and chaos does not itself equate to terrible

amsterdam  most comfortable city on the planet feels like a very small village but just has city number of inhabitants   berlin  best partying culture and urban exploration  budapest  festivals nature and locals are all great  bangkok  cooler and more hip version of tokyo sexpats drag this down on the list though  montreal  very unique atmosphere that is pretty chill  porto  cheap version of amsterdam  tel aviv  most beautiful mediterranean beach extremely nice locals and some of the weirdest mixture of cultures youll ever see   san francisco  hard to explain but being in this city is like being a protagonist of a surreal cartoon things youll experience all seem very bizarre weirdest place on the planet but that also makes it more interesting  istanbul  this is simply the best city for historic sights id say istanbul has the most history of any city in the world considering it had been the capital of the west for about 1500 years and the seat of power for the ottoman empire afterwards

  ive been planning to but i think im going to leave italy alone for a bit im thinking of seville spain for my next one      been dying to go to tbilisi since i saw the parts unknown episode what did you like about it
  the center of both those cities are very far from being shitholes i get that the outskirts are a little sketchy but you can avoid those areas also i like semigrimey cities since it gives the trip a bit of an edge

  tell me about shymkent im going there in a couple of days
  horrible choices besides philly and maybe stowe after a huge dump
  no besides ukraine kyrgyzstan and netherlands girls are ugly imo    youre kinda off season the best shit to do is go to the amusement park and aquapark and eat cheap fruit all day you could do day trips to taraz and turkestan
  yeah i know i am completely off season  i want to go there anyway i will go to astana then flight to almaty and visit shymkent  thnaks for the tips
  im very untraveled    porto  bilbao  nyc  san francisco    nowhere else ive been belongs on a list i hope to add to it soon
i am from montreal and i always wonder what tourist like about the city if someone ask me what is there to see i have like only 2 thing on my list mont royal park and old port/old montreal    i dont have a top 10 but here are some i really liked  tokyo  hiroshima  st petersburg  hong kong
in no particular order since its just hard to choose  beijing   hong kong   munich   bangkok  santorini   venice   madrid  ho chi minh city   athens   granada
  naples italy  you skipped scampia and quartieri spagnoli right
  mantova italy  now we are talking
  ghillbeline scum your german faggot daddy wont save you now
naples is probably the ugliest city ive ever been to
1 rome  2 venice  3 dubrovnik  4 istanbul  5 london  6 edinburgh  7 barcelona  8 vienna  9 bern  10 athens
  whats good about edinburgh anon
  everything but the weather its not a big city but you have enough things to do for a day or two nice architecture clean surprisingly good food nice people really nice to have a walk there are also things to see and do around the city the only thing i would say i didnt like about it was that its cold outside but inside of shops and restaurants they have the heat on and its hot as fuck inside so youll be sick and losing your voice in no time that happens in all of the uk though
no particular order    lisbon portugal  siena italy  vienna austria  hong kong  genaro herrera peru  buenos aires argentina  tokyo japan  edinburgh scotland  copenhagen denmark  seoul korea
  amsterdam  barcelona  london  lloret de mar  riga  st petersburg  porto  palanga  warsaw  helsinki
havent visited enough yet to make an extensive fully international list of cities i absolutely love but ill try my best    1 seoul  2 rome  3 kuala lumpur  4 taipei  5 berlin  6 den haag  7 kaohsiung  8 utrecht  9 busan  10 jejussi    i only now noticed theres so much cities i dont like
  i actually stayed in quartieri spagnoli really enjoyed it felt safe there scampia i did avoid however      are you sure we went to the same city its not straight forward beautiful in the traditional sense but it is gorgeous
1 hong kong china  the cliche of eastmeetswest is there for a reason the city is intensely fascinating i could spend years there and still have new things to see while central on hk island is mostly a fancy shopping mall now the mainland side still feels very unkempt and weird  2 budapest  locals were nice parties were fun the spirit of the city  hungary was fascinating and heartbreaking  3 chicago usa  i really enjoyed the broadshouldered blue collar vibe that you get from walking around the more historic parts of the city all those john hughs movies also probably give me some bias  4 paris france  the obligatory tourist sights are nice and worth seeing i really enjoyed the bakeries here though many good memories of eating breads and getting wine drunk  5 chiang mai thailand  a bit overtouristed but not to the same extent as bangkok or the south islands khao soi remains one of my favorite foods it kills me that i cant find a decent version of it in my current city  6 chengdu china  the picture of a chinese boomtown city the development going on here is staggering  totally changed my view of china havent been to schenzen but i hear its in the same vein sichuan cuisine here is good and will blow out your asshole  7 taipei taiwan  an interesting mix of japanese orderliness and chinese insanity folks were nice and accommodating to my kindergartenchinese skills  8 toulouse france  my goto recommendation for french cities that arent paris people here are actually welcoming to tourists and interested in where youre from  9 ho chi minh city vietnam  the controlled chaos of traffic here is a sight to see the food here lived up to the hype  10 madison wi usa  a classic american college town situated between two lakes summers in wisconsin are fantastic fried cheese is a specialty here and its a weakness of mine
1 london  2 barcelona  3 tokyo  4 new york  5 porto  6 copenhagen  7 granada spain  8 vienna  9 santiago chile  10 amsterdam
  shit i forgot about bern shove bern in at 9 and drop amsterdam off
  you probably miss the guts to understand it
  what did you like about osaka i walked from dotonburi to the tempozan ferris wheel then east across the bay on the bridge and back to dontonburi and i didt really feel like it was anything special or is the good stuff in the north part of the city
  10 madison wi usa    i can see why people like it but i lived there for 6 years and it really starts to feel like a small town theres not a lot of things to do unless you like to drink and eat however yes it is very picturesque between the lakes
1 seoul south korea  2 tokyo japan  3 osaka japan  4 busan south korea  5 hong kong  6 new york city america  7 amsterdam hungary   8 madrid spain  9 kyoto japan  10 st petersburg russia
  7 amsterdam hungary  damn bro weed has fried your brain
  fuck youre right ill just leave it as a testament to my stupidity i thought i should put budapest there but changed it to amsterdam forgot to change the hungary
  everybody else is as retarded as me and knows nothing about the cities i visit except memes  as a big history buff and fan of the dutch golden age amsterdam was fucking amazing and even better with the ability to enjoy a joint and whores after some exploring i dont care about real european culture that shit died ages ago and any other example is a joke compared to other parts of the world just turn that continent into an open air museum and stop bullshitting with the delusion that theres anything there that should be preserved that wasnt made 100 years ago im happy amsterdam doesnt delude itself like other euro major cities
  oh fuck im an idiot i didnt see what you were commenting on ignore this post

  1 taipei  good balance between japanese and chinese culture also cheaper than korea or japan yet cleaner than china or sea great food too    2 bangkok  good  of historical shit water sports at nearby towns sex tourism good food offering everything for tourists    3 sapporo  really nice during winter not too cold yet theres still snow literally the only japanese city that is not sweatfest during summer as well wouldnt recommend to people who are going to japan first time tho people like that should go to osaka and explore other kansai cities like kobe and kyoto to see some historical shit    4 washington dc  all those museums and cultural stuffs also good public transportation to move around kinda underrated city on the other hand sf is overrated i can see why americans like the city but for international tourists its just another global big city unless you go to stanford to see a glimpse of silicon valley or go to napa valley to taste good wine    5 cairo  city itself is kinda shitty but a bunch of historical shit not only ancient egyptian stuff but also islamic egyptian stuffs are worth looking into    6 istanbul  good food a lot of historical shit also doesnt look as shitty as cairo possibly the best city among islamic sphere    7 ulsan  home goodsized city with metro population of 1 million best beef and seafood in s korea decent beach and better air than seoul sad that hyundai isnt doing good recently and the city is slowing turning into detroit btwn the citys nickname is the detroit of korea due to presence of hyundais hq    8 budapest  the combination of classic buildings with commieblock is kinda interesting also goulash    9 london  the british museum is possibly the best museum in the world also great performance arts scene    10 rome  going there should be obligatory for anyone travelling to europe
  exact same top ten in the same ordereven tho the order is fairly arbitrary for me if so thats very strange

yall basic as fuck  so many capitol cities  so many disneylands    1 tbilisi georgia  great underground scene culturally quiet deep cheap friendly  2 chengdu china  everything that china can be less of what its becoming great base for the region  3 essiouera morocco  still touristic but the food is good and its much more chill than elsewhere  good expat community  4 bundi rajestan india  small friendly easy to get into interesting sights good food  5 soppong thailand  just a village really but surrounded by caves and adventuring  close to pai which has a good community and drunk white girls  i used to swing between the two  6 karakole kyrgestan  must people go for hiking but the russian minority villages are interesting and the hiking is fantastic it still has a frontier town vibe but soon it will be commercialised  bonus points for weed  7 istanbul turkey  like a world in itself so much to do so many underground scenes  you can be a tourist for weeks or dig deeper  8 rila mountains bulgaria  relatively tourisys in winter but in spring the forests are open and the girls are cheap visit monetaries much better than sophia  9 yangshaou china  amazing scenery centre is a bit of a disneyland for chinese domestic tourists but its interesting just to see that  10 north laos just go there

oh anons i traveled all around the world and you wont believe the places i have been   1 kaunas small city used to be capital for lithuania for a while but stuff happened and not a capital anymore ya know wink wink  2 vilnius capital of lithuania fun stuff trust me lots of places to dance and eat and do stuff  3 klaipeda seaside city interesting place good place at summer local place like palanga is nearby so lots of stuff to do and lots of tourists from around  4 london can be literally hellhole if unfamiliar with local britbong customs but once you get used to it place is unbelievable  5 some other local cities surrounding these places really good vibes in england and capital and excapital of lithuania trust me once you visit you might want to stay for longer time     give it a go you cunts maybe you will like it
  ive been there 8 or 9 times and found something new to explore each time the museums are great the parks are beautiful the transportation system is fantastic for visitors since it is all over the center where you would want to go there are countless well known monuments all within walking distance of each other there are tons of cool neighborhoods to walk around    it might not be a great place to live but it is by far my favorite place to visit

will a lot of places outside of tokyo be closed the day after new years
  outside of tokyo is anywhere else on the planet clarify
  bit early for a new general is it
where can i find events like picrelated
  outside don quijote on special days or any street corner in akihabara and harajuku
  do get precised though
  looks like from an anime con one of very many out there so just go to one and enjoy seas of people
  just like her too
    seems like it i guess
what are the greatest chances of me finding any cute attractive girls around the country
  i plan on going to ooarai for a day and dont know if i should go on the 2nd
  depends expect a good handful to be closed chains all over should be open like mos burger 711 dennys etc      cute girls exist all over anon are you talking about just meeting them or attempting to fuck them
  meeting them or attempting to fuck them  pretty much both of these ways for now
  true but even with more stores like circle k club sega and even costco as well
should i go to a soapland in the morning and then go to mogra for the anison matrix at night tomorrow    anyone have experience with either i am thinking paradise soapland but i am worried because it has been many years since i last got laid like 7 years ago and the last time some women wanted to fuck me i couldnt get hard she was black i dont find them attractive but it still messed with my head     as far as mogra is concerned my only problem is how late it starts and ends is it normal to go and then leave maybe half way through like at 2 in the morning or so
  soapland is fun and while i can personally vouch for paradise the girl i spent time with there is no longer in the line up however they do have a good amount of english speaking girls and all the other staff speak english as well
  im guessing the regular events are these open from 6pm to 11pm that sounds a little strange a club only being open for 5 hours to me anyways sounds like an easy job     arent soaplands really bloody expensive
what are some must try restaurants in akihabara i have a budget of about 100cad/meal
  soaplands  they can be depending on your budgets but which town are you planning on traveling over to
  should i go to a soapland in the morning  fuck no dude   to mogra for the anison matrix at night tomorrow  if youve never been sure but mogra is kinda a rippoff fun one time thing then thats it    as far as mogra is concerned my only problem is how late it starts and ends is it normal to go and then leave maybe half way through    few of my friends have played there we usually left around that time just know the trains aint running till 5am so good luck paying to get back home or a nice taxi fair      heros is good for steak takeru is good but crowded as fuck when open henrys burger is interesting aged meat bar is good but think is 2 people min    for food ill usually go up to ueno short and easy trip up
  how is a 15 door fee for a night of music and fun a ripoff i dont drink btw
this is gonna sound weird but is there a certain way you drink from public water fountains they shoot straight up how do you drink without it just falling back on the fountain head
  oh if you dont drink then idk couldnt imagine doing mogra without drinking or serious pregaming they play music upstairs and down stairs but idk anyone who goes there other than staff not drinking    the picture in the pic of mogra with tables and stuff yeah thats no not how that works at all ive never seen tables down in the dj area
  fuck no dude  why not they are privy but seem worth it for the nuru massage and the whole experience of it    also dont tell me to just go on tinder or something because i dont know how to pick up girls and it is too much of a bother to try and get one to have sex with me
  really have no idea which place you plan on going to or visiting so hard to tell generally mornings wont have the best of the best just the b or c team though they can be cheaper depending where you go     im guessing if you are going in the morning youre just looking to say you fucked a jap overseas want to lose virginity and dont care or trying to cheap it out
go to doctor for vaccinations  tell him about my travel plans to japan  nah u gucci mane just gives me a flu shot  read the wiki article on the japanese encephalitis today  half of the infected get turned into potatos  im really freaking out right now because im leaving in 12 days i thought about buying and injecting it myself but i dont know help
  youre more likely to die in a plane crash or get truck kund than you are anything else asians are more subseptable to shit and youre in off season for any bug kinda shit like the amount of people that get it and let it go on to full stages per year is so stupidly low also it generally affects very young or older people with much weaker immune systems    just take some vitamins daily like the ones posted early in the thread and youll be fine for most anything its likely that you can catch it in your own country during summer but probably dont or your body fights it off
  during 20072016 among the 55 reported cases all but one case from india were infected in japan among these 54 cases infected domestically the month of onset for the majority of cases was augustseptember fig 2 the earliest onset was april 14 case infected in hyogo prefecture 2014 and the latest november 18 case infected in nagasaki prefecture 2011 the suspected place of infection was from 23 prefectures all located in the western half of the country ie none east of the kanto region with many being in kyushu region and okinawa prefecture 22 among 54 cases fig 3 among the total of 55 cases reported 33 were males and 22 were females 39 were aged 60 years and 7 were aged 10 years fig 4 six of the cases 2 male cases and 4 female cases were fatal at the time of notification    conclusion since the 1990s the annual number of reported je cases has been at around 10 and remains low in recent years most cases were among the elderly 60 years of age with low immunity against jev fig 4 in countries that lack a je vaccination policy children 5 years of age constitute the largest number of je cases and 75 of all je patients are aged 14 years see pp 166  168 of this issue in japan je patients 10 years of age have also been reported and vaccination is an important measure against prevention of infection and disease    over the course of 11 fucking years 54 cases happened in japan only ever affecting anything worth noting to very young to very old
  but are some medications even allowed onboard the plane or will they be inspected only
  just buy shit there youll be fine stop being a nervous wreck see   again you probably are exposed to west nile virus along the same line of shit at home and are fine in japan youll be as fine
im interested in visiting minoh waterfall and the abandoned fukuchiyama railway trail when im visiting japan in march 2019 will the place be closed during this time
  closed nah should be open most stuff is open year round unless there is vast amounts of snow though most of that area isnt really too snow heavy especially in march
  mornings at soaplands are cheaper though so depends on how much he wants to spend
    youll be in a foreign land as a foreigner just strike up a conversation with them and dont sound like a tit or on the occasion they ask if you want to fuck straight away then bang you arent spending the ludicrous amount of money on a soap land that might go to waste because your junk decided not to work again     or you could just kys
  mornings at soaplands are cheaper though so depends on how much he wants to spend
im flying to japan soon and have us samsung note 9 does anyone know if it has felica/can it use mobile suica for transportation so i dont have to carry the card around with me
going in june when should i book a hotel
  depends on your budget if you want to save money but can spend more wait to catch lastminute deals so you dont get screwed if youre willing to spend a moderate amount of money now book asap
can anyone recommend me some worthwhile nature side trips from osaka id like have some contrast but have a hard time finding hiking trails and the like
which apa hotel should i stay at in tokyo

i want to go to tokyo for halloween          
  why to see other foreigners in shitty costumes i feel like last time were already more foreigners than japanese and where are many foreigners there is crime rape and other problems therefore they need thousands of police to keep an eye on you japanese hate halloween now
  well they pretty much have a lot of security guards patrolling around each plazas
  japanese hate halloween now  no they dont they have a big halloween in kawasaki that has been going on for about 20 years the majority of the participants in costume are japanese
  on here   
br dude here honestly im always surprised people come visit us our cities are boring as hell if youre not in rio or sao paulo i think what makes japan somewhat good for tourists is that tourists come with lots of money to spend and are usually wealthy coming from countries with dollars or euros as its currency thats how you enjoy brazil brazil is not for the poor living in a country that has some beautiful shit in it like fernando de noronha but not being able to use it cause its overpriced as fuck is totally depressing

ok ive got a pretty long language course in fukuoka coming up and i have a few questions i havent been able to find the answer to yet    1 im coming from the uk so i want to buy all my yen before brexit happens and the exchange rate plummets  however im not sure i want to carry six months worth of cash with me  are there any prepaid cards i can load up in yen not sterling this is important before i go    2 ive been looking at options for phones my current phone should work from in japan from what ive found xperia xa1 but are there any good simonly deals i should use  will dataonly be enough or would something with call options be a better idea
  get a starling bank account and you can use the debit card both to buy stuff but also withdraw cash from atms for no fee     you may still get charged a fee by the atm to withdraw cash but otherwise you just pay that days mastercard exchange rate which is always far superior to what youll get from any foreign exchange    i just transfer money from my main bank account to top it up whenever i need to    you could also get a monzo or revolut account they are the same for spending but have a limit on how much you can withdraw per month before you get fees so starling is the best for frequent travellers imo
  1 another option if possible in the uk is to open a bank account in eur/usd with a card attached to it then your money will be in eur/usd and you can withdraw them when needed in yen from any atm in japan     can you share more info about the course why fukuoka im thinking of doing a course myself
  well the course im taking is 24 weeks long and the course fees including dorm accommodation are 959500 yen ive been to the school before albeit quite a long while ago and they were pretty good    and why fukuoka two reasons mainly  firstly its cheaper than tokyo and ive been there before  secondly the food especially the street food of which there is plenty to choose from
  want to buy all my yen before brexit happens  brexit aint happening for a long time lmao
  why to see other foreigners in shitty costumes i feel like last time were already more foreigners than japanese and where are many foreigners there is crime rape and other problems therefore they need thousands of police to keep an eye on you japanese hate halloween now    god what a load of bs coming out your shitty post do the board a favour and keep your shit opinions to yourself
yeh and the longer it goes on the lower the rates are gonna go
  its all true sorry to hurt your little weeb feelings
  real bump
oh so this is what depression feels like im waiting for my connecting flight in lax and here i am after two fantastic weeks in japan i just see fat people and screaming children everywhere     how do i get out of this funk just look at my photos until the pain slowly goes away
  get your mind off of not being there
  japs love halloween and christmas theres more decorations and events every fucking year you lying weeaboo cunt     the most pathetic thing i see living in japan is gaijin attempting to suck up to the japanese please understand your fellow expats would gladly see you disappear under a bus and japanese think youre a fucking weirdo at best
  how do you parents feel about you wasting your time money and effort to learn a dying irrelevant language
  if youre referring to the truck being flipped at the shibuya halloween block party that was done by mainly japs as was the upskirt photography     and by blaming gaijin for everything and going along with whatever the notoriously biased jap media says the only weeaboo here is you faggot
  do they also celebrate easter thanksgiving and valentine days as well
  i think thanksgiving in japan is their labor day
  christians might celebrate easter i dont think they celebrate thanksgiving and valentines day is girls giving ornate handmade sweets and chocolates to the boys they like as well as generic obligatory chocolate to their male friends and colleagues white day is when the males who got gifts are meant to reciprocate and give chocolates back     christmas is a time for couples like a monthlong valentines day almost and the new year period is a time for family and praying at temples but westernstyle nye celebrations and parties take place in the bigger cities too
will movie theaters be open in tokyo on the dec 31st or jan 1st
  can anyone tell me some shops where i can buy love live nesoberis near shinjuku station
  i was in shibyua at halloween this year mate the streets were jam packed with 15000 people 98 of them japanese all of them having a good time seeing people dress up or dressed up themselves
  so isnt that a cop in the background btw
  just google 寝そべりぬいぐるみ ラブライブ 新宿
  i work from home online  i want to pack up for 3 to 6 months with my wife and live in japan for a while  whats the best town for that  needs to be relatively cheap safe and have good internet  big bonus points for powerlifting gyms near by or good regular gyms
going to google this as well but wanted to ask here too whats a temp job for someone who has software and art graphic skills i can speak fluent russian and english but no japanese a lot of my friends suggested to go into jet they said you dont really need to know how to speak japanese anyways but they also warned me the pay is awful so its like i have a lot of skills to offer just dont know japanese
pic related is a cute dog i saw at the fish market  just came back from my first time 3 week visit  i miss it already i had a great time    i also miss this tune a lot  
  i stayed at the apa in asakusa near tawaramachi and i had a great time they have a onsen/pool on the top floor and you can see the city
is a pocket wifi necessary if you only travel around tokyo  are there a lot of shops around with free wifi
  i bought a mobal sim card which was significantly cheaper and is easier as it doesnt require charging and carrying another device    free wifi wasnt as available as i thought
after working in a japanese restaraunt in canada for about a year and meeting all the japanese kids who worked there on a working holiday i have been planning on living a year in japan as i love the food and am big fan of the indie music scene there i spent 2 weeks in march in tokyo/osaka to see of my weeb dreams would be crushed but i actually really enjoyed my solo travel experience and want to go through with my plan to spend a year     the thing is i would like to try something different from just doing tokyo again and would like to live in sapporo for the skiing and weatheri hear they have cooler summers and very cold/snowy winters which are ideal for me as well as just a less cliche trip i am worried about if the music scene has anything close to what it was like in tokyo i liked the smaller shoegaze/mathrock/prog type stuff     also my japanese is quite limited but i can read ひらがなとカタカナ and some the most common kanji as well as a decent ammount of speaking and listening experience from work so i could expand my moon if communication with people in sapporo is as bad as i heard it was from coworkers     ty for reading my blog    would you reccomend a working holiday in sapporo for someone who likes the live music scene or sapporo in general y/n
  3 to 6 months  how do you handle the visa status on that
  i gotcha there thanks
  get it by there now
looking to rent ivideo pocket wifi for 4 weeks use in japan   been looking around lots of mixed reviews but most say it works in japan  anyone experience
  i mean you could easily use it on your digital camera also it worked really well for me at first
  n
  ive used them on my 2 visits and it worked perfectly fine the only issue i had is that there was one instance where the thing just got stuck on the home screen wifi itself was still functional but i managed to find a way to reset the thing and it worked fine afterwards    i do remember one person here mentioning that he had issues with it while in okinawa but i think he also mentioned that the weather mightve something to do with it
  partly true at least when were speaking about tokyo a lot of the younger generations love halloween as it gives them an excuse to dress up and party but the general public is starting to get annoyed by it all
is there any special name for the rivers like this with hill on both sides and the rocks you can step across in the water how common are they in tokyo
  maybe nearby the yokohoma river id say
  the area between the river and the slope is called 河川敷 or flood plain/river terrace
  very cute dog
  ok so my budget has shifted quite a bit i may only have 500 per month to spend about 72000 yen  bearing in mind that my course and accommodation are already paid for will this be enough or should i wait to get some more money together
  those are just flood plains you can find them near any river really       i have been planning on living a year in japan   good luck getting a year visa for anything that isnt a sponsored work visa
  500 per month to spend about 72000 yen  so thats roughly a little over 16 or 2400 yen per day its doable for sure but you wont be eating out or spending much during your free time
  as the other anon said 2400 yen a day is completely doable the biggest chunk of your cash will be coming out of transportation you may want to look into either bringing a bike over or buying one there to cut out costs of train passes    2 day subways passes are 720 yen but still for a long time a bike makes more sense economically dont think you can just walk everywhere unless you have very good shoes and/or dont care about your feet
  student visa  working holiday visa  check you eligability for those if you plan on staying a year
  depends i usually just get a phone for my sim wifi is mostly available but not as available as you would thing aka no free open wifi areas that dont require you to sign up    willmyphoneworknet is a good utility and if it works with ntt you would be best grabbing  no limit and decent lengths of time for usage pocket wifi is good if you have multiple devices or people needing wifi other than that a sim is probably the way to go as you dont have to carry more shit around cheaper and one less thing to keep charged
has anyone had their pocket wifi delivered to their hotel would they just need my id give me my package etc ill be arriving on new years eve and i doubt ill be able to pick up the wifi at narita
  narita has wifi pickup and dropoff zones there is like a wall of wifi vending machines after customs
  and how are the chances of getting a ride from narita into downtown tokyo
  100 buses run constantly for 1000 yencash only iirc the narita express if fucking amazing 4000 yen for round trip ticketsvalid for 14 days or covered by the jr pass big airports and transportation to and from them dont stop because its new years most all of tokyo will be open the only things that will be closed for new years in japan are smaller mom and pop shops most anything else is open
  you would probably make more on jet than you would using software and graphic design skills     use jet to basically finance a gap year or two of travelling in japan and asia and seeing if youre one of the 1 of people with just the right mix of autism and social anxiety to consider living in japan longterm
  ill be arriving on new years eve    i think you may be overthinking just how unimportant new years is to tokyo while yes it is a big thing and important to many families it doesnt shut down tokyo or main cities for that matter as a tourist the biggest issue youll have to deal with is small food shops closed some small trinket stores gardens and museums closed tokyo is one of the biggest cities on the planet and isnt closing up shop because new years sure offices may be closed or running a skeleton crew but that wont affect you by any means aside from some shops possibly being more crowded trains will be running buses shuttling and taxis making a killing in profits your chain resturaunts will all be open 711s lawsons and other stores open just count on some shops closing up early    unless you are going to some small town like takayama you shouldnt notice all the much closed that would hinder your plans
  the only cure is going back to japan sorry i still remember how neutral it felt to be back home always get more culture shock coming back to the us than being in japan
  thanks ill find out a little bit more and then see about that once ive arrived there
could someone please post that website that shows upcoming live music events in tokyo cant even remember the name
ive studied japanese for the past year ive been using anki and im up to nearly 1000 mature words pic related not a huge weeb really just wanted to learn a difficult and interesting language with lots of good media to consume for practice im planning for my trip to japan this march    what are some travel trips specific for someone who knows the language well enough to hold simple conversations    what are the best places to practice my japanese    will knowing japanese help me make friends will it help me meet single women    the japan general op often says japans sex industry is almost completely inaccessible to foreigners who do not speak japanese i see this one has a caveat what about people that do speak some japanese how will my experience be different    anything helps thanks /trv/
  what are some travel trips specific for someone who knows the language well enough to hold simple conversations  that a lot of japanese probably wont talk to you unless at a bar social event or something like that trains are usually dead quite and people dont walk and talk all that much unless its business people dont talk all that much over lunch either     what are the best places to practice my japanese  bars common areas in hostels arcades parks etc you might actually find more people attempting to touch up on their english more than anything though your japanese will be appreciated a bit at restaurants and stores but it will pretty much be the same song and dance at each location also talking to anyone before noon is down right next to impossible most the time since everyone is constantly fucking gogogo mode    will knowing japanese help me make friends will it help me meet single women  yes and yes    the japan general op often says japans sex industry is almost completely inaccessible to foreigners who do not speak japanese  thats more of a meme than anything you should have 0 issues with getting into the industry if you arent a dumbass the biggest leg up youll have is the ability to understand if someone is trying to rip you off a bit easier but you should be fine so long as not listening to nigerians in shinjuku japanese will come in handy if you are going to go to a club or bar and the ability to really talk with women probably the biggest gain is here for knowing japanese japanese will just kinda help you understand the signage for a massage shop or soapshops though more and more will have a girl standing outside or some kind of english lettering depending love hotels will generally only be in japanese though and are almost always cash only    youre probably going to be kinda shocked at how non talkative japanese are unless they have a beer in their hands
  also you might find it kind of funny how many people will be speaking english phrases to you in tokyo there is a sizable push in both the business front and the government front to get english phrases down for the upcoming olympics
  i see i have only ever been to japan a few times during cherry blossom season/golden week really curious to see how different if at all the country is during that time
hey im in kyoto any of you lads wanna get a pint or karaoke later tonight
  shit will be as closed about as much as it was for golden week  a few more shops i went to japan last golden week and read online about how oh its so busy oh all things are closed and worst time because its expensive none of that seemed to be really true compared to other times i had visited
  how do i convince my mother that i dont want to live in japan ever since i was young she has been trying to convince my father to move to japan since it would best for our son she keeps bringing up about how japan has the best schools and have fewer crimes than america and how he wont be discriminated by a racist
  he wont be discriminated by a racist  if hes white then thats true  if not well bad news for you and your father
  what is she japanese or something
  your mother is either japanese or retarded likely both
  my mother is japanese
  explain to her that  there is far less financial aide for things like schooling first time home buyer etc  you will be working till you are dead or so old you cant enjoy anything  college compared to american degrees are a joke useless for the most part outside japan  the amount she and your father make will be substantially lower  you can no longer be dual citizen  moving out from japan post graduation is a much harder than moving into it   work/life culture considerably worse  access to many resources becomes limited    she keeps bringing up about how japan has the best schools  shes fucking wrong japanese can memorize a lot of functions and facts but critical thinking ha public schooling isnt the best i agree but private schools exist in the us and arent that bad not to mention most schools have ap or honor courses if youre 18 then america has some of the best variety of colleges you have to chose from compared to japan  have fewer crimes than america  yeah forget the amount of suicides unreported crime and other shit that goes on japan has also far less car accidents but also less people driving      she must have grown up in a really privileged family then because most people who moved out tend to stay out
i heard that you can trade in stuff at stores for money   things like anime figures and similar   thinking of bringing some rare american comic books  anyone tips for shops that might take this kind of stuff
  you could go to either like a pawnshop or a thrift store to do that
what should i do if i get checkedout of my room at noon and dont have a flight until 7 pm over at hanedaairport
  play arcades
burgerbro here i am considering going to badenwuttemberg in late may/early june for about a week and a half im planning on basing myself in stuttgart and visiting other cities from there    im mostly interested in history museums and architecture what other cities/towns in the state are worth visiting preferably within 90 minutes of stuttgart by train
no one has any advice
  esslingen  has a nice old town and a famous christmas market  ludwigsburg  some nice castles city is meh  schwäbisch hall  hidden gem open air theater on the stairs in front of a church is unique in germany afaik  heidelberg  obvious  freiburg  vibrant student town access point to the black forest  konstanz  next to the lake constance probably better to go there in the summer  würzburg  lovely city even though it is in bavaria
  even though  kys
  triggered much seppl
    this guy knows his stuff great advice whatever you do just dont waste time in places like frankfurt it was either bombed too much or not enough also remember germans overall have the personality of an autistic wet mop
anyone have any bachelor party experience in budapest escorts strip clubs bars etc
budapest sucks dick go to to spain
  this   nobody goes to budapest anymore its too crowded
i got my shaft rubbed both the times i visited was ok  went in the morning there is a happy hour in most saloons generally 11am to 12pm
stag pahties r the best innit mates
get out normie
  might be going to budapest as wet but more interested in food
  market halls for lunch piac  cafès for breakfast kávézó  every other type of food place for dinner
got four days booked off this december where in europe would be worth seeing money isnt too big an issue but i would like to keep it cheap if possible    i want to go somewhere new ive been to berlin budapest ljiubliana krakow a few cities in croatia and prague i was mainly thinking of rome or vienna but im open to alternatives
  i had a really great time in kijev this january its cheap the food and the women are great and theres a ton of stuff to see
try going to a great european city this time  london  paris  rome  madrid  athens  vienna  istanbul
  sounds interesting ill definitely look into it flights arent too bad im leaning more towards rome at the moment as i think vienna would be too expensive and busy right now im just concerned that december might be a shit time to visit rome
      if youre looking for cheap no major city in europe comes cheaper than kiev however you seem to be already set on visiting rome so go for it it will be cold wherever you go
  rome in december isnt very expensive or crowded its not as crowded as the mayjuly period at very least the problem is that it tends to rain quite a bit and can get fairly cold
  nah i am open to other cities but i enjoy roman history a lot and as im from the uk i dont have any clothing for majorly cold weather
  why not go more south then bari or naples and the surrounding towns are super comfy and the weather is much nicer than in rome
lecce is the nicest city in mainland southern italy imo nice in the sense of being less rough and ready and a bit more manicured than naples or bari or brindisi naples has loads of atmosphere and is pretty amazing but relaxing is not quite the right word for it
  pompeii is the best
  naples has loads of atmosphere  thats an awfully cutesy way of saying the naples is a dump
  copenhagen is nice at christmas im there at the moment
  its not a dump its intense and amazing bari yeah maybe
i have a trip to kyiv booked for next month how fucked am i if martial law is declared will travel be restricted    
  maybe
not as fucked as the locals
    youll be fine russia doesnt want to invade ukraine anymore and ukraine wont shut everything down and destroy what is left of its economy     visited kiev myself a few months ago you wont even notice ukraine is fucking huge    worst case youll be vaporized immediately when the first nukes hit
  yeah i get that the conflict is pretty far from kyiv and i was never concerned about that im just worried that if they impose martial law therell be some sort of curfew    worst case youll be vaporized immediately when the first nukes hit  i can only hope
  well no worst case is that you are on the outer edge of the nuke blasts survive and succumb to radiation poisoning a few months later
    still worth it just for the chance of sleeping with a goodlooking ukrainian
  youre pretty lucky prices will drop as tourism drops and the ukranian currency drops against whatever your currency is    meanwhile there will be no wars even close to where youll be staying so this is actually beneficial to you believe it or not
    ukraine is already ridiculously cheap as it is but this is a good point you might be able to save some money in accommodation now that some foreign tourists will inevitably cancel their bookings
  thatll be great considering ill be on a bit of a budget im really looking forward to the nightlife among other things and really hope any sort of martial law doesnt interfere with that
  or there might be a 10 pm curfew instituted  or foreign tourists will have to walk around with identification papers at all times so that the police can issue a bogus fine to fill the state coffers  or therell be a rssiansponsored violent rebellion in kyiv to punish the ukrainians for declaring martial law  theyve done that before  or therell be an antitourist sentiment because the country is on the verge of war and the citizens dont like the idea of war zone tourism  or your country might touch off the local government or the russians and youre sent home to guarantee your safety and avoid international problems    dont let down your guard this is how people get killed and then laughed at  dont let it keep you from going either but dont convince yourself theres no danger at all when its an exceptional situation theres no way that thinking a country in martial law is not going to change at all is responsible and neither is it to tell someone else that it is
  wont happen dont listen to the bullshit grandstanding    the war is still very cold and barely worth talking about the ship seizure will amount to nothing especially as russia was the one to call for an un meeting showing they dont wish to do a surprise invasion big enough for ukraine to actually implement a curfew that ruins their entire economy
  you do realize that putin is old sick and grey by now and desperate to go down in history as the next great russian leader  if theres any nation that has a track record of declaring wars that blow up on themselves its russia and putin is intentionally imitating great leaders like czar nicholas who singlehandedly annihilated his own countrys navy by sending it to a distant border skirmish and staffing it with siberian tribesmen and recruits  never underestimate how willing russians are to shoot themselves in the foot just to make sure no one else wins they have a historical record of telling shameless lies because they know everyone else will think its grandstanding then blowing up themselves just to make sure no one else wins
elections are next year and poroshenko is not winning in the polls so you might expect some ruckus   10pm curfew  you would want to be inside anyways after dark because the packs of stray dogs chase down and eat anyone left outside after sunset
  or there might be a 10 pm curfew instituted  wont happen unless russia fires up the war drums and goes into total war wont happen  or foreign tourists will have to walk around with identification papers at all times so that the police can issue a bogus fine to fill the state coffers  ukraine wants to better their relationship with the eu and nato theyll know better than that as they have been working hard the past 4 years in cleaning up corruption from police officers and try to make it easier for westerners to travel to make a good impression  or therell be a rssiansponsored violent rebellion in kyiv to punish the ukrainians for declaring martial law  theyve done that before  not going to happen people in kyiv get beat up if you speak russian or ukrainian with a russian accent  or therell be an antitourist sentiment because the country is on the verge of war and the citizens dont like the idea of war zone tourism  not the case ukraine tries to be very welcoming of western tourists more than ever since they want to give a good impression to the eu and nato and again the people feel like that is the future of them and ukraine  or your country might touch off the local government or the russians and youre sent home to guarantee your safety and avoid international problems  wont happen as the west has official ties with ukraine after 2014 and basically every place already has picked a side
    the poster above explained it well ill just add wtf dude this stuff was going on decades ago ukraine as of now treats foreign tourists eu tourists most of all like royalty the place is starving for foreign money but its nowhere near shit holes like moldavia or egypt where youre nothing but a walking money bag ukrainians are polite highly educated friendly and honest as long as you dont go around looking for literal whores and gold diggers worst thing to happen youll get overcharged half a dollar out of a 30 dollars dinner
  please take your russia hatred and fear mongering to the appropriate subreddits
    hes not wrong putin completely fucked russias economy even their space launch services have turned to shit  drunken technicians jamming parts in upside down and then forcefitting them because who gives a fuck any more            no no vasily is orbital rocket not icbm is not supposed to hit earth even if icbm is not supposed to hit launch site
  he is completely wrong about putins full scale invasion or whatever he was hinting at with that post this azov sea shenanigans are nothing more and wont amount to anything serious  all that curfew bullshit would be simply poroshenkos political moves because hes about to be removed from power its the 54th time he has cried about russias imminent invasion since he was elected

what is the best city in australia
this one    or any that doesnt have retards like you who cant use the catalog
melbourne  dont listen to australians who talk shit  its usually political its the progressive city in australia if you dont live here that doesnt matter though  melbourne has great food and drink night life live music sport art and just a genuinely cool vibe dont fall for the bayside memes though its the inner urban areas where the fun is at like northcote fitzroy hawthorne brunswick etc  brisbane/sunshine coast/gold coast is nice for warm weather and beaches gold coast in particular if you like partying  sydney yeah the weather is alright but you can see the main attractions in a weekend  hobart is alright if youd like to see a bit of nature  canberra has some neat stuff if youre interested in art museums and political stuff  darwin is ok if you like tropical weather and getting shit faced with idiots  the other major cities dont have much on offer of course smaller cities can be ok to pass through briefly
  what is the best city in australia
  can you please give me a guide for the nightlife in melbourne im interested in the illegal raves they sounded so cool when people talked about them but i heard about it when i just arrived in australia and was too intimidated by it to go are those raves happening in the summer as well im heading off to north queensland from sydney for my 3 months of slavery so lack of a proper night life is already implied
whats the best big 300000 and over american city to live in
  300000 and over  thats kinda small dude
  i wouldnt say new orleans is a small city personally or atlanta but they both have only around 300000 even where im from outside the usa has 500000 but feels a lot smaller at least in terms of infrastructure cultural and historical relevance things to do etc
  are we talking just within city limits or city  surrounding         because you have about 66 to choose from if you are talking city immediate surrounding whole different ball park
  just city limits
  can you stop posting this off topic shit it has nothing to do with travel
  in the city limits themselves atlanta and new orleans both have huge regional populations    ever heard of arlington texas or hialeah florida both are just nowhere suburbs but are over 300000
  let me save everyone the trouble    you should live in insert city  insert city fucking sucks its filled with racial slur    repeat for 499 posts
why do you need to make this thread every week
    thats a pretty big list of places     what do you want in a city what do you want to avoid
  really depends what youre into what your career is how much you want to spend on housing whether you can tolerate winter etc    for me personally if money was no object id live in san francisco otherwise i think minneapolis/st paul is the best frugal place to live
  hard thing to tell you since us cities can be a cluster fuck one city may have 200k but oh look there is a river and on the other side is another 250k    finding a city with under 300k within city limits is kinda silly you should be looking for regions
  every american city is shit and hell
  detroit
  tacoma wa
  fresno dude
  kansas city
  pretty much this  us is much better for nature based tourism
phoenix az
  washington dc is epic
    id argue that bakersfield bako edges it out
whats the best city in europe for a cheap party weekend with good food nice clubs and scam free strip clubs earlier this year me and some friends went to gdansk poland would rate 9/10 rich history cheap everything and nice women
  strip clubs are waste of time imo just go to kiev or lviv get erotic massages better than sex for 20 euros and enjoy cheap quality restaurants if you go to lviv i can suggest salon marmalede for massages
  what did you get for 20 at marmalade
  thai and body to body massage after marmalade i went to another massage salon there was only one ugly russian girl with belly in marmalade girls show up and you choose a girl
  so no sucky sucky or etc planning on going to riga but it seems pretty dull
    basically naked girls make a massage with her tits body and hands and at the end of the massage make you cum with her hands
  frankfurt  fkk sharks or oase if you want women and a partybut theres absolutely no worthwhile history or culture in frankfurt
  istanbul
anyone made the crossing between these two cities aside from the migrant problem are they noticeably different or does it feel like you crossed into pretty much the same country im surprised from what i saw on street view malmo seems a lot cleaner and more organized than copenhagen the latter looks more like one of those decadent messy british cities than a nordic one     also what are some countries that you expected to be similar but turned out to be very different once you crossed a border for me the most memorable was crossing from portugal into spain and already in badajoz i noticed spain is ten times nicer although i always thought the two countries had similar living standards a spanish border town looks more well taken care of than the portuguese capital lel sorry portubros     im especially curious to know if there are big differences between these  us x canada  japan x s korea  argentina x uruguay   s africa x botswana   romania x bulgaria  germany x austria
well i used to commute between malmö and copenhagen so i got a pretty clear picture of the differences living in copenhagen now does make me miss the more organized less drunk/homeless people of malmö    however i do think that a lot of the differences is due to copenhagen being eight times bigger than malmö and being the capital there are many differences that comes with that    culturally they are very similar but there are of course much more to do in copenhagen especially in terms of night life culture shopping and so on different laws when it comes to access to alcohol drinking age is lower in denmark in sweden taxes are high and you can only buy alcohol in special stores in denmark its everywhere which adds to it being more messy during weekends and so on i wouldnt say that its more so than in other european countries just next to sweden/norway it looks a bit more messy    it is a lot more expensive in copenhagen though so there are many danes who go to malmö for shopping/cheap weekend get away
us x canada  almost identical except the american side has more flags on display there isnt even a formal check for most of the border    heres a pic of the dprkchina border i wasnt able to go to the nork side but i think this is pretty telling of where the money was
  there isnt even a formal check for most of the border  have you even been to the border my guy
  so if i want to feel like im in latin america i can just go to portugal instead neat
  san diego to tj comin up hope to see the media circus by the border    does hong kong still count
  germany x austria  you wont notice a difference    romania x bulgaria  i took the bechetoryahovo ferry across the danube last year and the difference was surprisingly big romania maintains a distinctly romanian flavor of commie architecture while bulgarias shithole towns look very similar to those of russia or ukraine bulgarian villages and towns look significantly more rundown and deserted took me by surprise since romania is pretty ghetto already there are fewer strays in bulgaria than in romania romania has better roads    however keep in mind ive only been to the northwestern part of bulgaria which is the poorest region in the eu and supposedly notoriously shitty even by bulgarian standards
netherlands x germany  the city of kerkade/herzogenrath is the only distinct border town of both countries it was famous for having one of the least enforced borders in europe at one time even before schengen was a thing    today even the streets where the border still cuts through the differences between both sides are more evident than red and blue    especially the supermarket prices on the german side
  northwestern bulgaria is worth visiting if you want that authentic 80s commie shithole feel seriously that place is so rundown its literally not even fun anymore otherwise bulgaria isnt that bad and from what ive heard most of the roads at least in the south are much better than romanian roads
  differences between both sides are more evident than red and blue  so is the dutch side nicer
  better than transnistria
  of course its nicer
  have you get off the highway and take a rural road theres lot of empty albeit illegal spaces to enter the us
  why take the risk if youre caught you could be banned for life from entering the country again
  im not advising someone to enter illegally im saying that for most of the border the difference is so negligible there arent border checks thats the ops question man
best places to go for a first time visitor
hong kong
  what anoit beijing
  beijings been shit since way back when they clamped down on plasticchair street corner bbq and moreso now that theyve bricked up all the first floor apartments that were makeshift stores stuff like the forbidden city  surrounding temples are pretty stale go to the south or hong kong / taiwan and the beijing monuments seem sterilized in comparison also theres no real fake market anymore and most of the nightlife is pretty stale compared to shanghai
its very safe for foreign tourists so anywhere is fine maybe shenzhen or shanghai is easier for the first few days
  taiwan worth visiting on a first trip thinking of going to 34 places sounds like hong kong should be 1
  macao  1
patrician answer is hong kong with short trips to macau shenzhen and guangzhou
how good is taiwan half of the comments i see seem to say its boring the other half loved it    im into hiking scenic places good cities that are nice to walk around etc    im going to china/hk for a couple of months and am considering taiwan
i hear hk is gay af
  stop hanging with gays fag  only gays and closeted gays call anything gay
  taiwan 1  honestly its beautiful its way better than mainland people are nice and welcoming nature is beautiful food is awesome and grillz are qt azn waifu tier  other than mainland ppl are not afraid of talking to you  also they got sick electric scooters over there look out for gogoro performance scooters if youre into that stuff
  taiwan  china
  tell me more about the scooters are the cities set up so you can ride around on them everywhere are they like a bikehsare system
  beijing   shit  your standards sound quite high
  japan fine
  kashgar   sips tea
  yunnan and guanxi
  not a real bikeshare system for the scooters im aware of had to rent the scooter the traditional way at a scooter rental shop  im talking about the gogoro electric scooters that are everywhere in taiwan like half of all scooters in taipei  taipei and other cities have thousands of battery stations where you just change your empty batteries to charged ones whenever youre low on power    driving one of these was like the most fun ive had for a while would recommend get the 10 hp performance model if available its crazy fun  
i did beijing and shanghai both are very good
shanghai getting around is easy and all the tourist areas are relatively concentrated together the people know a lot of english too the only downside is that its the most expensive place in japan     i just got back as some general tips always carry around tissues and hand sanitizer in your pocket because most toilets wont have either
  beijing is great to see some classic history full of mostly chinese tourists but its an interesting way to meet chinese people i found them generally very friendly and curious about me id recommend a central hostel the one i stayed in was leo  cool vibe around all these old buildings the wall is amazing too 100 recommended  shanghai is an awesome modern city the french concession is lots of fun i had a group of cute local girls flirting with me trying to teach me i like you in mandarin  theyre very different cities but both are worth it in my opinion
  most expensive place in china fuck me
  do you live in 1937 boy
i really enjoyed xian much more walkable than shanghai/beijing and the muslim street was amazing for eating     can do day trisp to terracotta warriors and huashan as well
why do people stay in hostels when the hotels are so cheap    i can have my own room and bathroom for 150 yuan or pay the same and share with a bunch of hippies and sex pests
  howd you get there
  did you say muslim  reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
  taiwan is 100 worth visiting arguably more than anywhere on the mainland regardless it should be pretty easy to get between mainland/hk/taiwan
  not him but in my case we took the sleeper fast train from shanghai and flew to beijing
  are the trains cheap compared to europe
  yes also hsr is just something that we dont really have in europe besides some obscure french lines hsr is nice hsr is good hsr is the future
  whats hsr
  tbf ive never taken the train in europe besides france if memory serves well we paid about eur 80/head for a private booth 2 soft beds
  high speed rail
  besides some obscure french lines  they are like the main lines tho  paris to most bigger french cities also to brussels london and somewhere i forgot in germany
xian wuhan chengdu and shanghai all large cities and you should be able to get around well
  dali
anybody have recommendations for things to see in/around chengdu    im mostly wanting to go for the delicious food but i cant simply eat all day for a week also food recommendations would be nice
  why do people stay in hostels when the hotels are so cheap  socialising with fellow travelers and because hostels are set up to help backpackers do things
  also laundry hotel laundry is always absurdly expensive if they even have it and the turn around can be slow sometimes  hostels usually have washing machines and lines for use
  low libido  low level of stress hormones enables them to be around people 24/7  could also be basic blank personalities they are nothing unless they have other people around as an audience  could also be typical american tourists they only have 2 weeks so travelling is not a lifestyle being around sweaty cunts is perhaps easier since you have a set return date
just how dangerous would this adventure be
  you cantforeigners are not allowed to enter the tribal areas from afghanistan and you can only go there from within pakistan with a special permit
  if you take the southern route directly between iran and pakistan its doable
  i was wondering when this thread would show up again     were you inspired by the saharan dreamtrip thread
  nah got a link to it
you would be killed somewhere between the afghan/iranian and paki/indian border
i follow several hitchhiking pages on facebook and european kids post about hitchhiking the old hippie trail all the time iran is the easiest part theres nothing adventurous about traveling in whats probably the friendliest country on earth  i wont comment on afghanistan since i dont know  in pakistan you might run into freedomofmovement restrictions it depends on the region also the visa is a pain in the butt and you have to apply for it in your own country before you leave  if you have an american passport none of this is possible
  this not a serious thread tho but ill post it for posterity    the southern route is where its at youd be travelling in an armed convoy for a bit between the iran border and about 500km  inland in pakistan other than that there arent any dangers en route
  bagina xddd
  other than needing an armed convoy for 500km you wont be in any danger
i really hope this becomes possible again in my lifetime doesnt look too hopeful atm though
  its pretty basic we even had a guard going into the nwfp way back in the nineties there are armed convoys you tag along with its not arranged for your purpose and armed means that there are a couple of cops with aks traveling with no bmps no rpgs
  so if you skip afghanistan the only area with danger is from the iran border to quetta a 2 day journey heres a recent travel blog about it   
isnt it funny that western relations are the absolute worst with iran but iran is far and away the safest/most stable country in the region
  only usa has a problem with iran and israel  saudi arabia is the key to that saudi arabia on the other hand is best friend and all round stand up dudes when it comes to the usa apparently meanwhile everybody else can have a jolly good time in iran and now at a cut price rate
  i would totally visit iran if tensions werent so high ive heard the people there are actually really friendly even to americans its just the governments that have beef
  im guessing youd have at least a weeks head start if things were leading to war that should be enough to leave the country trump needs to manufacture a smoking gun first and selling that implausible lie will take some time
  the nicefuckingmeme trail is safer
    if you have an american passport none of this is possible    the only part thatd be difficult is getting an iranian tourist visa that allows for unaccompanied travel ive met several americans whove visited pakistan and none reported any troubles whatsoever if anything its an easy visa to get provided you apply before embarking on an overseas trip
  how much does this cost
  prolly nothing check out the travel blogs   when i went to nwfp the guard seemed to have his own money he jumped out of the truck to score some hash as soon as we crossed the border extra funny cause he was a real cop albeit 16 years old
  for what it seems just to say you have been in a dangerous area better just to go to northern india if you want a similar landscape
  i know whenever this gets posted its a joke but in all seriousness why wouldnt this route be possible    benis to tehran is fine tehran to the afghan border should be doable and safe enough the route ive shown through afghanistan only has a yellow advise against all but essential travel rating up to kabul on the uk foreign office website after kabul theres a 230km stretch in the red zone pakistan should be safe enough especially travelling through islamabad and lahore then of course india is perfectly fine    so really the only bad part would be the 230km drive from kabul to the torkham border crossing right or am i being too naive    im british but have a very wealthy friend with important ties to the government there so he could almost definitely get me a business visa to independently travel around for those who dont know uk canadian and us citizens need to be on an official tour for their whole trip in order to obtain a tourist visa visas for pakistan afghanistan and india are all easy to get
  i will only travel abroad once in my life and once youve seen one landscape youve seen all similar ones    the world does not work like that and india is a nuisance pakistanis and iranians are prolly the friendliest people on the planet indians not so much
  ties to the iranian government i should have said
  iran was pretty safe for me when i was there but i havent been to baluchistan/afghan border which iranians warned me about
  why whats wrong with the iranian/afghan border i doubt the taliban operates on the iranian side
  not at all unless apu runs out of mana
  why not just do nice meme
what about this
easy mode until you get passed herat then you are earning some serious real traveller points
  m8 youre one he insulted islam chant away from life in prison assuming you dont pay them off first
  id give it a 17 out of 1000 points crossing the afghan/paki border will give you 10 extra points so 27 in total if you do enter areas that are fully and continously controlled by the taliban let me know and i will discuss it with the rest of the board it might make you eligible for 30 extra points
  bretty dangerous anon but you will have my sword
benis to bagina is babby tier compared to this    if you make it you get 1000000 would you do it
   traveling through germany    no thanks i dont want to be raped and murdered
  this trip would award you between 50 and 120 real traveller points depending on what you do id recommend it to anyone wanting to gain a lot of points in one trip    best regards
  this is wrong indians are really really friendly to foreigners as long as you take the initiative in greeting them first im not gonna lie when i went there i was pretty intimidated because whenever i walked through the street i would be greeted by a thousand stares but i soon realized that they were stares of curiosity only problem in some cases was the language barrier down the line i did end up learning a few important phrases to make my visit a bit easier though but i met several others who could talk in english at a basic level and others who could speak pretty fluently  the main reason this whole indians arent friendly meme even exists is because people get intimidated by their stares and never really approach them in the first place
  fuck no i went to cape town and durban once never again even though i live in sa
  i literally just meant not so much as pakistanis and iranians so i did not need half a wall of text ive spent more than a year in india and pakistanis and iranians are less hassle and more brotier that is all
  iran  is safe now  
  cape town is awesome wtf you on about
  south ohio  hope you arent black
  this made me properly kek
  this actually seems like it might be a fun trip to do with people
have about 4000 usd and want to travel to someplace in africa for a bit but no clue where any anons have any suggestions on what to do on this budget
  south africa fuck pol it is an outstanding destination
  south africa seems a bit boring though and ive heard its full of racial tension right now
  if sa is too boring then the rest is bound to be more boring     full of racial tension  polmeme that will not affect you one bit     but ok then go to malawi watch the tropical fish get stoned be bored
  but i dont want to get stoned and im not much of a safari type either but i love nature and beautiful surroundings with a mix of city once in a while
  morocco rocks also where are you located now
  i live in scandinavia  ive heard good things about morocco
maybe check out east africa kigalis surprisingly nice zanzibars beautiful and cheap lots of stuff in kenya
  ive heard west africa got the least amount of colonial treatment  hows west compared to east
  i love nature and beautiful surroundings with a mix of city once in a while    well that is cape town and it is high summer there now while morocco is actually gonna be quite cold you can take klm ethiopian and turkish to cape town and its pretty fast and cheap stay in sea point and go for hikes 20 mins from your front door or stay in simons town or fish hoek and have whales jumping outside your window or do both i usually do some time down on the peninsula pretty but boring then get a flat in town sea point gardens etc which is stunning and with access to food museums table mountain and beaches
  huh that does sound pretty nice actually  do you work for the sa government since youre so apt at advertising it
i would go to namibia desu
  namibia looks beautiful too im a big desert guy
  i just love the place and ive spent a lot of time there and it gets cheaper every year due to the rand being quite fucked up and i am tired of the polfaggery related to south africa fuckers can afford to watch a molyneux video they can not afford a plane ticket    if you are down on the peninsula you would benefit from having transport but in the city you can cope with uber
  how recommended is night walking  in china i could walk in some of the most poverty stricken slums without a single fear  does the same go for sa
  the slums are out of bounds at night time there are tours in the daytime no worries if you want to have a drink of moonshine in a tin shack bar then that could be your ticket but you will see those slums when you leave the airport and thats pretty much as good as it gets     there are group night walks up to places like signal hill i would not do it alone you could stroll down the main streets of sea point clifton camps bay etc without a problem you could also go for night walks down on the peninsula without an issue daytime walks are perfectly fine everywhere in the city bowl you need to be a bit more alert at night think of it as a large us city or london it is not mogadishu
  would be interesting to go but i dont want to spend a lot and travel on my own
  aha alright so it depends on the area  what areas are the best when it comes to hotels and easy access to general stuff
  have you thought about finding a tour company
im going to south africa next year and my capetonian friends tell me you can spend a month there for anywhere between 15003000 us depending on your budget    morroco seems a bit touristy already and egypt is overrated     i want to go to either eithiopa kenya tanzania or a combination of the three i heard the wildlife is amazing there and ethiopian food equally as good
  sea point think art deco old jews boardwalk safe as fuck very central close to walks    clifton  camps bay  safe as fuck millionaires row posh restaurants atlantic seaboard good walks    fish hoek and simons town  more remote safe as fuck daytime and evening train few restaurants whales good walks warmer indian ocean seaboard good value air bnbs    muizenberg  learn 2 surf slightly less safe than the other places
  damn thanks dude
  my pleasure enjoy
  nobody travels to the west of africa at all have you even researched this
  africa is a rather large place with more countries than any other continent depends a lot on your interests   do the garden route in s africa   eat delicious food in cape town  smoke cheap blonde hash in morocco  see selfdrive wildlife at krueger  do a cool wine tour in franschhoek   culture in egypt red sea is awesome dive with whale sharks in djibouti ect so much
  stupid comment based on idiocy  i travel there regularly one of the best places ion the world racial tension will effect you 0
  nobody travels there i hardly believe this   what for
is africa the most blandest continent out there not talking about northern africa btw for me africa  blacks     i mean if we are being honest wildlife is all it has going on    laughable mountains  boring jungles  cities no one cares for  cant even walk around most capitals because of violence  over 60 of the continent is entirely off limits  mountains are a joke  you need a car  distances are absolutely huge     i think its worth one trip max to see some lions and elephants but other than that its just large and empty
  west africa was jungle where they took slaves east africa has much more grassland and the british civilized them a bit more  west african countries are smaller borders and visas can be a hassle       if you go to cape town you avoid a lot of the problems because its mostly coloreds there and the eff type are more in the north east
   are absolutely huge  that is your one accurate statement     you avoid a lot of the problems because its mostly coloreds there   actually the coloured group are the slightly more pissed off not that it will affect 999999 of visitors  black south africans are quite warm and sometimes really quickwitted and funny t ive struck up conversations with black security guards or maids and it has turned into absolute top conversation within about 10 seconds of talking thats a stereotype though and it might not be true for everyone
as long as you stick to cape town and the countryside youd be fine
  uganda is nicer than people imagine and it has some budget safari options unlike kenya
  whats boring about their jungles there seems to be lots of good hiking
  why so different more people travel to kenya
  i found prices to be quite similar like 110150 a day for the cheaper tours when i did research a year ago also kenya seems to have more to do on a backpacker budget like hiking hells gate or visiting that lake i dont remember the name of    what bothered me most about safari tours was that they all seem so rushed and if you do a 3 day budget tour half of day 1 and 3 are wasted going from and back to the capital
  spoken like a true loser
  super cheap to get to morocco from europe btw
first time skiing in europe   dont want to spend a fortune  dont want to ski in ice or rocks  preferable if accessable by bus or train  help me out bros
ive never gone skiing but im heading off to poland in a few days zakopane is apparently dope for it and poland in general is dirt cheap im checking out the beginner slopes at the nosal ski centre
serfaus  fiss  ladis   or   st anton
  pyrenees is cheaper than alps thats all ive got    im from barcelona you can go skiing here its a 2 1/2 hour train ride a bit of a journey but the ticket is cheap and that way i dont have to pay for a hotel for the night
  bumping this thread for more skiing wisdom    i want skiing to be part of my europe trip but i simply want to try it never have done it before so i dont know what to start with    i guess i have to go to skii resorts are these resorts the same place where you stay or you have to look for some alternate accomodation should i take a skiing class or i can directly start with it    ps i am in italy right now and i am open to move anywhere for this desu
georgia
  you def need a class  italy has good resorts
  everything is accessible with public transport in europe so you do not need to worry about the train or bus part  you do need to choose between not wanting to spend a fortune and the chance of no snow though the resorts that always have good snow are significantly more expensive than the ones where you might end up having to go hiking and spas instead of skiing
  so is resort the place where you stay or you stay at a different place confused because im an arab new to the snow and shit    are 3 days enough for a skiing trip
unless you are athleticish take a healthy attitude to getting kicked in the ass and have loads of money i do not recommend starting skiing on your vacation its hard to learn and frankly its a waste to learn on some amazing and expensive mountain you just wont get the most of it if you decide to blow thousands on a week learning great get lessons your friend cannot help you much unless they are skilled and good at teaching    i was lucky enough to learn as a boy ive seen way too many people spend all their money on a three day trip where they dont learn much and end up dead tired after you do that next time will be better but learning to ski takes time and money it is a holiday/recreational activity but it takes time to get there      basically everywhere in europe there will be somewhere you can sleep at the base of the mountain or a short bus trip away like i say above you can learn a bit in three days id say three days on sticks is a minimum for a first timer
expert skier/snowboarder from colorado here i live in europe now and hope to ski this winter ive skied on some dinky hills in germany before but i really want to see how the alps compare i just need a mountain with lots of expert/out of boundary terrain when is the most reliable time for good snow i have flexibility on when i can do the trip and id like to be able to just go wherever has the most snow
  italy has some really great skii stuff madonna di campiglio or bormio are both stunning and great for beginners  alps are generally good  i dont know if the season already started if there is enough snow etc tho
  depends  the closer you stay to ski lifts the more comfortable everything is gonna be more expensive too some people like to drive to the pistes each morning but its just a fucking hassle to find parking space if its skiing season besides you have to be experienced with winter driving conditions to do that so better confirm you have a free ski bus running to and from your hotel to the ski lifts or if you can just walk to the nearest ski lift there are always buses but you want to know where exactly to find them  3 days is probably the amount of time where it might start to get enjoyable for you if you can stay at least one week you will get tired after 89 days for sure but day 567 should be fun also the weather can be a hit or miss if you are only there for 3 days there is a higher chance that you cant even see the mountan for like 2 days cause its snowing or something  if you are new to skiing familiarize yourself with the concept of ski piste maps google some mountain names  ski maps its a different view than usual maybe if you hike a lot then you ran into simar hiking maps make sure you can read them esp if you go alone on the nth day you dont want to be stuck on one side of the mountain after the lifts stop running while your hotel is on the other side even if you have some chocolate and rum in your inner pockets you dont want to be left to the mercy of the ski resort workers who check the pistes after closing
  everywhere in the alps is pretty much great skiing  stay away from switrzerland as it is rediculously expensive  austria always has good apres ski party atmosphere  france is less party  but great skiing   italy is also pretty nice but often less snow sure as it is on south side of alps  eastern europe is a lot cheaper but also much smaller ski areas and longer lines
  you cant just start skiing you have to learn it a few hours at least for the very basics  dont go doing stupid shit you can really hurt yourself and others on the slopes if you dont know wtf youre doing you can always look for sledding places you can do that right away
  thank you for the eyeopener  i was gonna take my girlfriend for a skiing date even though we both know jackshit about skiing  thought maybe it will be romantic but i guess i dont wanna die in the alps  i will try this maybe a few years later
  maybe do a little day trip up the mountains instead you can often travel quite a way up with gondola lifts and the like which can be used by nonskiers
  thats a terrible terrible idea take her on a ski date when you actually git gud that way you can teach her and be her hero if she keeps seeing you fall over and over because you suck shes going to get warmed up by chad that night
    consider doing cross country skiing if you have no experience  much more beginner friendly and still get snow  skiing utilizes some weird leg but and back muscles that you probably dont work much  also rental boots will be way more comfortable
  pretty much this austria is best value overall and i am swiss switzerland is ok if you know your way around and the skiing is top in both places
im also heading over to europe for some skiing over dec/jan anyone know of any good lodges or areas around the dolomites/austrian alps/former yugoslavia where i could go solo and maybe hook up with some dudes for backcountry fun times
ive been to the french alps and it was shit ice and cunty french children everywhere    colorado was amazing in comparison
what are some decent cheap starter trips to take preferably international ideally places with favorable usd exchange rates    im able to save money but i really want to get out on a trip by mid january so im looking at spending 25k at max

  doesnt open for another 300 years anon
ive never lived on another continent or learnt another language planning on moving to madrid from april until september and taking classes     ill have roughly 14000 us to cover spanish lessons and the normal cost of living for the 6 months is it feasible is im planning to live with a roommate i have no idea how much groceries cost in spain but i only plan to eat out when friend invite me out looks like lessons range from 100180 per week    anybody live in madrid or have experience learning in another country
  do it in south america on the cheap argentinian pesos not looking to hot you can learn spanish with out sounding like a fag and not dealing with africans
food is fairly cheap in spain as a whole though im not sure about madrid  are you gonna need a student visa for what youre planning you should make sure before you go if thats the case they might require you to show proof of a specific amount of funds
  south america is not as cheap as youd think i cant speak for argentina but a year in ecuador wont save you anymore money than say a year in the us midwest especially if you try to live the same quality of life some things will be cheaper some things will be a lot more expensive it works out to about the same    in mexico they jack up the prices for nonlocals in any place you can actually live without fear of being decapitated
  i was wondering about this also i have been all over spainmalaga granadamadridbarcelona etc and malaga was one of the cheapest and chill placeswith extremely attractive girls ive ever been i was thinking about doing the same 3 months learning spanish at one of those all day schools unless you are trying to go clubbing everynight it was super cheap and i went in the summer during tourist season i liked the idea of going to colombia to learn spanish but looking at airbnbs and etc by the time you get a decent place and all that it does end up being the same except its much more dangerous and sketch in colombia and if you wanted to get away for a weekend its a hassle to take the bus/plane anywhere there     in spain you are only an hour or two flight to londonparisamsterdamrome and the flights are cheap and available almost every hour/day
  im going to double check but the plan is to go for the first 3 months on the regular 90 tourist days then come in on a 3 month student visa ill be able to probe funds and because the student visa is under 6 months i dont need to prove insurance or run a criminal check      i have a ton of porteño friends and plan on spending alot of time in ba after this stint i want to do spain first because theres alot of things i want to do in europe weekend trips to basque champions league final in madrid doing the berlin marathon with my mom
    i took classes in spain for only 3 weeks and i didnt know a word prior i learnt so much and it was my fondest memory of all my travels i was quite sad when i left and id only been there 3 weeks     if you have any questions id happily answer
  which city/school did you study at what did the lessons cost    how did u find living accommodations/how much did you pay for them or did you just stay in a hostel
   no valencia  you damn pleb op   local products are fairly cheap youll undoubtedly have to get yourself a roomate otherwise its just too expensive unless youd like to live in the outskirts btw public transport is efficient and cheap   honestly i think you should get to a1a2 level of spanish by yourself wouldnt take you that long you got duolingo ffs the difference and progress ive seen in guys that come knowing some basic spanish and the ones that dont is astonishing honestly get 50 hours into the language and itll make the difference
  whats with valencia i missed it last time i was in spain but i heard its really touristy    i work with quite a few spanish speakers and we go back in forth with some basic conversation and grammar rules every now and then i also use cue cards on brainscape and some verb conjugation apps    ill have a month off before i go too ill havs time to really hit the books then
  whats with valencia  honestly fuck knows its an incredibly overrated city by tourists imo if i had to make a list of the top places to visit in spain it would hardly make the top 10 then again it may be a good place to live as a student i guess i would consider salamanca and granada instead both beautiful lively and compact student towns that are dirt cheap even by spanish standards
  valencia is kind of boring outside of las fallas
bump
    i studied in granada at a school called escuela de lengua  i cant remember the exact prices as it depends on how long you book for     they offer accommodation which you can get discounted if you book both the lessons and the accommodation together i had a private room in a 2 bedroom apartment right above the school and it was great as you stay with other people from the school and i would just wake up 15 minutes before class get some breakfast then wander into class     the teachers are great and they try and speak as much spanish as possible and only english when its needed the classes were small and intimate and made being friends with everyone quite easy    this was 3 years ago and im still friends with some of them to this day and just went back to granada this year its changed a little bit but its still a great city    i also still follow the school on facebook and it looks like not much has changed and they still do all the fun activities and immersive things they did when i was there     obviously peoples experiences will differ but i still look back on it and wish that i blew all of my savings staying for 2 months rather than coming back home with some money in my bank account     sorry for the late reply anymore specific questions pls ask
  if you get a 3 month student visa and want to combine it with 3 months visa free you probably have to go in and out of schengen in between
    no worries man this is super helpful i was wondering if it was better to use provided accommodation or find my own so its good to hear from your side i assume you were 20 lessons a week        nothing that a quick weekend flight to morroco dublin cant fix would schengen let me in with the visa free if i have an approved student visa waiting to be used
    iirc it was 10 a week i was looking on their website and some stuff has changed since its been a while i dont remember doing 20 but that would be even better desu
i just visited my friend whos on erasmus in alicante and shit lifes cheap over there over the course of 4 days of which we dined out every day as well as going out getting shitfaced twice we ended up spending about 100 bucks a person     i couldnt believe coffees were 1 buck a pop un americano por favor    for reference my friend pays 300 a month for a small room in an apartment with two roommates
  you need to ask the authorities directly about such visa questions not a cambodian weedwhacking forum all i know is that most likely you cannot change your visa status while inside schengen so yes you will need a quick weekend flight to somewhere
  yeah spanish consulate isnt responding to my emails so ill have to call once i get proper cell phone reception in a couple days
  if you are not that party guy go to salamanca keep studying in weekdays and travel to know spanish cities in weekends    argentinan accent is a litte bit strong if you are going to southam for learning spanish go to peru they said it has the most neutral accent
  spaniard here dude with 14000 you are more than cover for 6 months you will have a pretty comfy stay a room in a decent both in size and location shared apartment is around 400/month groceries are dirty cheap also you will have a good chunk of leftover money to make plans going out for drink/eat and travelling around
  valenciabro here kind of a dirt poor mans barcelona city is relatively ugly compared to other places in spain the city of arts and sciences is falling apart due to no money beaches are ok if you like jazz music this is the place berklee college of music has a campus here and those kids are topnotch thats about it
  i was a jazz major is in college might be interesting when i was in spain last both madrid and barcelona had decent scenes just by virtue of being large european cities
  ok three music venues for you radio city jimmy jazz and mercedes jazz club
hi fellow travelers im going to goa in a few days to spend christmas and nye any recommendations of stuff to do and see or things not to do    thanks
go somewhere else goa is trash nowadays and especially during christmas/new year
go to both vagator beaches yes theres 2 of them anjuna is okay    stay away from the popular beaches go find a hill top for nye and watch the fireworks from there    check out little shacks by the beach super cheap to rent perfect for backpackers dont expect hotel like amenities dont pay more than 800 they can go as cheap as 200    get an international license idp and rent a scooter i recommend honda activa should be rs 250/day or less best way to explore goa because public transit is shit and taxi drivers are scum
  do not
anyone here ever been to rarotonga going there for a thing next year what is there to do or see around the island or within daytrip boating distance of the island    i also heard they have two breweries is the beer any good i do like craft beer
knew someone who went there on a stopover with air nz  said it was nice but as an outsider youre expected to pay quite a bit for stuff and just treat it like a tropical island so overpay for food and drink and sit on the beach and swim    
  figured that might be the case thanks    any particular things that might be worth checking out though
  ive literally never heard of this place pleasant surprise as ive been all over
  its a pacific island with a population of 10000 and part of the cook islands an autonomous protectorate of new zealand not exactly the highestprofile place in the world lots of new zealanders and some australians go there for holidays but americans and europeans generally have better options available
im 39yo white american male im independently wealthy 100k in savings and i work remotely at 100k per year     i only speak english i would like to be married in the next few years to a woman who is out of my league genetically speaking not that into asian women or black girls where should i expat to
come to england or scotland lad  the north is lovely and you could live like a king up there
  i would like to be married in the next few years to a woman who is out of my league genetically speaking not that into asian women or black girls    probably russia to optimize your odds shortage of men who arent alcoholic bums but then youre living in russisa i would pick bulgaria
  im independently wealthy 100k in savings and i work remotely at 100k per year    uh huh
cool larp bro
    this  though poland or elsewhere in eastern europe is probably where a larper should larp as going
100k isnt even that great for age 39  only a larper would think thats independently wealthy  if youre going to lie at least lie big idiot
  really want to make the most of my money was thinking somewhere where i can get more bang for the buck with my shitty dollar
  if you have 100k in thailand you can buy 80 mansions
  no you cant      id say colombia or venezuela if you want a bombshell i wouldnt go for russian or most other eastern european women the ones you will get as a sugar daddy will be boring as fuck
  if they notice you have money in venezuela youll be killed tortured robbed and maybe eaten not precisely in that order but i can recommend colombia rich neighborhoods are safe life is relatively cheap and every region in the country has women for every taste
  why bulgaria are the women very attractive
  100k isnt even that great for age 39  wait what
just coming in to say how much of a massive faggot op is lmao
  unless you live in bumblefuck nowhere its not really that much for somebody who has around 15 years experience    im 38 and i make around 100k annually and i would consider myself firmly middle class
  thats not independently wealthy thats not wealthy at all
  independently wealthy 100k in savings
  if youve been working and saving since college even a modest salary and 401k/brokerage contribution should have you over 100k by the time youre 40
  the real expats ive seen go to thailand pi or brazil
      actually deluded  100k even after taxes is fucking immense on a global scale regardless of age  you fuckers have drunk the usa coolaid that if youre not a 25yo millionaire youre somehow a lesser being  kys
  why is a global scale relevant op has already ruled out asia and africa
  come to india
  jordan or lebanon unironically levant women are quite good lookings also maghreb tunisia algeria morocco has good women imho
  im not saying hes poor dipshit hes the one who said hes independently wealthy making 100k a year with 100k in savings i have both of those things as well and while i live a good life im definitely not wealthy i only called him out as a larper because if he really had both of those things hed know that too
  100k savings at 39  woah you have 10 of the value of a small suburban piece of shit house     you truly are living it up
this the guy has 1/5th of a house paid off in what universe is that wealthy lmao
100k in savings is not wealthy but 100k a year is a decent salary and would make you wealthy in most countries in the world however op seems to think that his savings is what is making him wealthy and to only have 100k savings from a 100k salary at 39 makes him a complete moron i call larp
  you really need to be saving more 60 year oldfag here with a 80k/year job and 17 million in retirement so far you should be putting away at least 20 of your income at your age
  you sound insufferable
  probably russia to optimize your odds  ahahahahah
  not that into asian women or black girls  posts photo of a white guy holding a negress  k      seriously i saved 125k in four and a half years of work and i wasnt earning anywhere near 100k thats net savings in a bank account not gee i earned it but wasted it on buying cristal for club sluts and buying myself double caramel onions pumpkin spice lattes at starbucks and thats after getting wiped out twice in my life once by the dotcom collapse turning all my great tech stocks into garbage and once by the 2009 financial trainwreck    i had 40k in the bank two years after college and i was just getting started at a shitty it helpdesk outsourcing operation earning maybe 50k/year
  lol    op probably doesnt want to live in a complete shithole where everything smells bad especially the people how are the designated shitting streets in your neighborhood pradeep
  double caramel onions  interesting the board now automatically changes soy to onions sort of like desu gets changed to desu i guess some mod got tired of being called a basedboy
  oh cute and soyboy becomes basedboy ah 4chins how sad that you got taken over by sjw niggers and pooinloos
  its about to get wiped out again my friend buy bitcoins
  op here im insanely wealthy relative to whatever shithole country im going to expat to     where can i move to with my money and live like a king and where the chicks dig white boys with money
  4chan has 60yos thats awesome
    south america is your only option if you dont like asians or black
  and eastern europe forgot that
  you can still say nigger and poo in loo  they only blocked soyboy because it was being used so much the same way tbh was switched to desu
  at basically 40 100k is not really that much in terms of accessible savings you should be looking into at least 250k or so to consider well off     is fucking immense on a global scale  yeah wow and people who work at innout for 15/hr in la look like fucking kings to most people in india
  thats the point of this fucking post you retard
  bulgaria is rated the ugliest country in europe not memeing
100k will get you a year and a half of modest living in western europe once that time runs up kill yourself and youll have been set for life
  yep been around since the usenet days
  a bunch of potato farmer looking fucks there
  i work remotely at 100k per year  i dont believe you theres literally nothing like that      the obvious answer is brazil or anywhere in south america given your cash and your whiteness youll have your pick of any of the local girls and practically be worshipped
  work remotely 100k   cool story hansel    if u got cash and want to move go thailand or from the sounds brazil     im trying to move to bangkok in the next two years    i havent seen south america
  op here im insanely wealthy relative to whatever shithole country im going to expat to    not really alot of these countries have a huge gap between the poor and rich so the rich are rich as fuck and the poor are poor as fuck    eg thailand  there are some super wealthy people there then there are a huge amount of poor  i know that expats buy units/condos in bangkok that they think are lush when it comes time to sell the rich thais wont bat an eye at it for a downtown weekend getaway too shity   and your average thai wont be able to afford it leaving it very hard to sell gotta wait for another stupid expat to buy usually
  these counties have huge amounts of wealthy people most of them dont disclose there wealth for reasons to do with tax safety and privacy mostly     but fuck yeah south america and se asia got some real big money ballers
  guys that dont come up on your top 100 rich lists but theyre wealthier then half of the lists
  how easy/hard is it to just up and move to a country like colombia do i need a visa or whatever tf
  colombia  if youre american or euro then no visa neeeded for 90 days then in that time you can just come up with whatever reason to extend your stay and receive a cédula de extranjería national id for foreigners staying longterm  migration laws in colombia couldnt be softer as historically there has never been any need because no one migrates to this shithole as long as you dont get involved in some pedo prostitution ring like those israelites in cartagena you wont get in trouble with the authorities  getting a wellpayed job though is extremely hard so you gotta either have enough savings or work remotely for some company overseas
    100k per year and only 100k in savings wont get you any good property in the uk  fuck off were full
  1000000 house  small piece of shit in suburbia   yeah maybe in the fucking bay area a mil will get you a nice place in like 99 of the us
  he can buy a mansion in lincoln nebraska  that would be hilarious you can spend all your money on a giant house and nice car then be completely broke and have to get a job at walmart to eat and pay taxes  utilities
  54 here oldest claimed age ive seen was 72      likewise remember the great renaming
   im insanely wealthy relative to whatever shithole country im going to expat to  but youre not tho    where can i move to with my money and live like a king and where the chicks dig white boys with money  pretty much nowhere decent youre not going to find that in the us or europe or australia youve ruled out africa and asia that leaves south america i suppose you can do reasonably well chasing tail there but they arent going to consider you fabulously wealthy    let me give you an example in russia right after the collapse of the ussr women would get into catfights over any foreign man who would go over there they were whoring out their children to keep from starving they were absolutely desperate to get out now most of them are comfortable enough that they wont even speak to you they might condescend to lead you on and scam you out of your 100k pressuring you into spending it on pointless shopping trips with them but theyre not going to consider you wealthy wealthy is one of the oligarchs who has 100 million or a saudi prince with enough money to own a private jet    you have enough money for a couple of decent cars and a downpayment on a condo your future income is speculative and might vanish at any moment mine did after the dotcom collapse ive been struggling ever since
    earning 100k a year in latin america isnt wealthy     not op here but youre fucking retarded
  he doesnt know about oldchan
  not for educated people it doesnt seem as though you understand how those kinds of economies work its 99 stumpy brown people who work with their hands and 1 mestizo or white people who have family money and maybe have some kind of office job to maintain a pretense of productivity    so yeah you want a brown village girl go crazy enjoy your culture clash
  yep hung out in soc and misc  but really hit my stride in alt 
  you dont know what you re talking about most of people in colombia or brazil dont have these lives lol there are a great amount of middle class people in these countries
  he is a retarded i live in south america and i ve never seen whats hes talking about and 100k a year is upper middle class in the most decent cities of brazil
  go to the uk you will still be rich there but you can live a normal life anywhere else you are going to be an alien for the rest of your life its not worth the struggle since you are rich enough to live well in the uk
  doesnt colombia has a history of super cheap hitmen sounds like a lovely place
make up your mind you can either opt for candy or for a family but not both
  you consider yourself wealthy at 100k  i must be filthy fucking rich compared to you
  i really dont think it is 100k would get you a small house on a small lot in a smaller town in mexico amd then what would you do
  thats pretty true and 3rd world shitholes are usually only cheap if you live like them living in a hovel and eating rice if you want to enjoy a respectable comfortable lifestyle it will cost money anywhere in the world especially if you need security
  and living in a stupid foreign culture forever gets boring really quickly especially if it is an undeveloped country
yeah go live in s shithole country and import some of those international parasitic values     gimme free shit   you must celebrate christmas  free high grade pussy  free education   i dont want to work so gimme gimme more free shit
  is this really true i thought russia having more women then men was mostly a meme the reason why the stats favour women is because drunken men die in their 50s leaving 40 women as single but i doubt anyone would wanna date a 40 year old russian
  i really dont think it is 100k would get you a small house on a small lot in a smaller town in mexico amd then what would you do  depends on perspective if he is comparing himself to a kid in a somalian village yes but if he thinks he has the type of money that people will worship him in eastern asia or eastern europe then he is mistaken
100k can get you a house in decent places in america you just wont be living on the coast in the arizona mountains you can generally buy something okay for that price midwest is the same way you could get something decent on the outskirts of dallas and use that major airport to bounce around the world
i have job offers in singapore and am wondering if anyone has experience living there im english mid 20s and will be on a 7000 salary    what can i expect from   night life   hobbies im big into salsa dancing and serious discussions eg religion geopolitics etc   girls   travel whats nearby thats interesting to go to    i last lived in cambridge where all of the above was satisfied quite well
the fuck are you doing for a 7k salary send me some money dude wtf ill take a dollar all the way up to 10k whatever your generosity provides paypalme/jasonsmith97
  i have job offers in singapore  how i desperately want to live there
no drugs  no culture  you will get caned  etc  its no fun dont go there
  84k/year in singapore isnt exactly a stellar salary
ahow them your white
moscow or st petersburg  which russian city is better
  idk which one has the best whores
  although i loved the moscow kremlin a disneyland for government buildings i believe st peterbourgh has a larger number of beautiful things to see
  moscow  for hardcore guys loving to party and move fast  saint pidorsburg  city of arthoes and their cuck bfs
    i much preferred st petersburg    cheaper nicer easier to get around
  do both    that being said i preferred st petersburg
  both are mustsees imo    on average st petersburg is more conventionally beautiful and often ranks in the worlds most beautiful cities however in some ways i think i liked moscow more at least the centre thats big enough and doesnt have commieblocks everywhere the kremlin metro lomonosov university skyscraper business centre are all amazing and grand if that makes sense moscow gives off the aura of an imperial capital much more than st petersburg
why do they suddenly seem to hate china
    theyve been very honest about it its getting hard for them to live and work in china now and they arent the only ones
  why would you like china
they just realized their wifes are ugly
its abnormal in the sense that theyve been in china longer than most westerners have and it took them this long to realize how awful china is
  both their wives are quite appealing imo and one of them is a doctor you know vivienne shows too much gum when she smiles but other than that she is quite adorable but your point was moot anyway they are obviously bringing their wives along cmilk firstwinstons waifu comes along later afaik
didnt the american guy flee back to the us and is trying to sneak za in through the migrant caravan
are these 2 american or british dudes who ride bikes all around china i think i remember seeing one of their videos a number of years ago whats their name
  serpentza  advchina  one of the waifus has a channel called vivienne
    also  laowhy86
  vivi has her appeal but come on sasha mogs the absolute shit out of her in looks you can really tell shes from the lower caste southern chinese race
  the lower caste southern chinese race  looks perfectly sea but yes sasha is more classically beautiful but if it wasnt for the gummy smiles vivi would be a 67/10 in my opinion
    one guy is south african the other is an american jew
    it took them this long to realize how awful china is    do you think the chinese realize how bad it is or are they blinded by their own patriotism/lack of means to escape
  american jew  he recently took a dna test that came up 0 jewish
    hes likely matrilineally jewish which means he could probably get a tv show but not much more
  because up until recent most of the people who would go to china were generally boomers in tour groups who would go to select places and thats it now that travel in and around is easy and cheap more people realize just how crappy it is
  having a tough time doing youtube in china and concerned about being deported theyve pretty much explicitly said it
    just last week this french teacher/youtuber got fired from the university in china because of his youtube videos
  do you think the chinese realize how bad it is or are they blinded by their own patriotism/lack of means to escape  in my experience most chinese are pretty clear sighted about their countrys issues  are you clear sighted about your countrys issues
has anyone here ever used cheapoair    the reviews arent great but the prices are very good
using otas is generally fine until something goes wrong having to deal with a middleman generally adds extra cost and frustration so take into account any admin fees or cancellation policies that differ from booking direct    i always try to book direct with the airline now having experienced annoyances in the past
  ive used them several times works just fine
  do you get the tickets instantly once you book ive heard a horror story where one person didnt get their tickets from the site until 3 days before the flight
  ive used them no issues    the reviews arent great but the prices are very good    as someone who was in the same boat as you keep in mind many of the low reviews are for bullshit reasons when using this site assume that    all sales are final  there is virtually no room for changing/modifying a trip after bought  keep layover times in mind  biggest reason i saw this site get 1 star reviews is because some dumb bitch assumed that 90 minute layover in china was all they needed and oh no one plane was late like always in china and they missed their connection  this site sells for budget airlines often eastern china is one of them many reviews go onto cheapoair about in negativity  reviews for many sites like this are often mostly one sided and leave out details as travelers never make mistakes its always the airlines      seems kinda odd and that something is being left out like maybe it went in a spam folder how soon did he book in advance etc etc i get mine in like 12 hours usually my bank takes the longest time for stupid shit like airline tickets just read the fine print in regards to the tickets you plan on purchasing like really examine layover times cancellation policies and such
  op again took the plunge and booked it last night and got the confirmation of my seats today     so far ive only got emails from cheapoair will i eventually get an email from the airline itself how else will i check in at the airport
  what airline is it eastern china or the like is fairly arms up in shit about stuff the cheapoair should have a reference number you can look up though for additional confirmation
  japan airlines it gave me an airline confirmation number which applies to both flights but it doesnt say what to do with it
  the airline confirmation number is tied to your purchase generally you provide that along with your id to the checkin counter and they look up your purchase confirm information and print out the tickets for you     tickets arent generally given at time of purchase due to gate changes and tons of other factors they would be useless by the time you get to the airport
  ah after navigating through about 15 pages in 2 regions i finally found where to put my confirmation number on the jal site     im all sorted thanks for very much for the info anon
  until it isnt then your stuck with dealing with those idiots especially with a schedule change       are you talking tickets or boarding passes they ticket almost immediately either on the first carrier or using hahn air 169 stock  for boarding passes the industry standard is 72 hours because thats when the flights are open open for check in airlines can set their own business rules tickets and boarding passes are not the same thing but are often used interchangeably      the airline confirmation number is tied to your purchase generally you provide that along with your id to the checkin counter and they look up your purchase confirm information and print out the tickets for you   correct    tickets arent generally given at time of purchase due to gate changes and tons of other factors they would be useless by the time you get to the airport   incorrect  this is an eticket which is usually issued within 24 hours of purchase or else the airline will cancel the pnr a ticket acts as the form of payment to the airline   to the customer it simply represents a receipt to the airline its how payments are processed     opinion from an airline fag book directly with the carrier cheapo air is poorly trained
be prepared for small itinerary changes like they will change a connection here and there this is rare but be prepared they have always worked in my favor in the sense that they have shifted it to a slightly earlier flight lol    also you will earn shit miles on your ticket i dont mind as id rather pay 200 bucks less and get less miles
  ever use cheapoair  i use it every year and i shall use it in a few hours    so long as youre not an idiot and can actually plan your trips and stick to said plan youll have no problems not being a woman helps
i bought business class tix from them half year ago istanbul via frankfurt 2 wks in japan to auckland 1500 euros or so kinda bargain  seems like they just phoned or used gds to book flight directly from lufthansa cuz they wouldnt sell me at this fare direct  managed to get 200 euros back via air nz miles
  ya thats a schedule changeairline advanced airline change in departure time as opposed to a delay unexpected change to a departure time around the time of departure thats when dealing with them is a pain in the ass   when it gets to be a pain in the ass lets say you they are supposed to have the ticket reissued by whoever carrier they sold it on even if it wasnt the carrier that had the schedule change   this can cause quite a bit of run around between the passenger the travel agents and the carriers involved if a flight is delayed its the carrier that caused the delay is responsible for reissuing the ticket     this happened just last week my carrier had a schedule change on another airline ticket with cheapo in the middle after the customer got the correct answer that airline b needed to reissue as a sked change exchange the ticket   about 3 different times i just said fuck it and broke the rules as it it was a delay   now im with a us based carrier for us domestic flights the rules are different internationally especially for int to int markets this causes immense confusion on the half of their agents and nothing but headaches for the passenger     fuck cheopoair most of the time i end up having sympathy for the customer and doing their jobs for them
i used them to get from cairo to houston two layovers one in moscow and one in ny when i got to ny i had a very short layover of 25 hours immigration held me up they often do and i missed my flight the airline could only give me a ticket for the same flight the next day when i called cheap o air they said they couldnt do anything for me i ended up spending the night in the airport kind of sucked after a long flight and no sleep plus it was another day to wait after almost two years away from home
  the reviews arent great but the prices are very good    that is probably just a coincidence right
  i was going to essentially post this    i guess it depends on how well you can afford to pay for the avoidance of such problems    if i could only afford to travel buy using these services id use them if i could afford ro say away from them i would because i dont need extra layers between me and a solution if my trip fucked up somehow
  just dont book on a poverty airline
  see     its a middle man airline and any reseller has horrible ratings because usually things completely outside the sites control i used cheapoair to go to japan my first time last year and it was painless i was super scared about my trip because after reading reviews it was all like 1 star then i actually read the reviews which most of the time someone was changing their schedule and didnt get a full refund    more often than not cheapoair is doing all sales final
  im really just blogging/venting i fucking hate cheapo air and the frustrations are palatable if i never have to hear one of those outsourced call center morons attempting to tell me how to do my job again ill be very happy     absolute nightmare to deal with from a carrier to travel agent level and often times the unfortunate customer is caught in the middle     from an airline fag to a consumer fuck these clowns i can solve your problem in 5 minutes youll spend 5 hours on the phone dealing with those retards
does anyone have any ideas to see unusual/interesting/awesome wildlife anywhere in the world  i have seen most of the obvious ones most recently anteaters in brazil
  well the everglades has some really cool wildlife its one of my favorite places on earth theres also a park a few hours from my grayson country highlands that i go to every so often to track down and pet/feed the wild ponies sorry thats all i can bring to the table
  if you live in south america go explore the rainforests before they are all turned into söy farms
  most of the obvious ones    not sure what that means can you give us a list    in the meantime    yellowstone go off peak season though or most of the wildlife you see will be people    galapagos islands    going to the wildlife park in nairobi is interesting  not even close to the best wildlife in africa but there is something about seeing the wild animals of africa with the city even the airport right there im assuming most of the obvious ones means youve already done at least some of the african parks    australia once you see all the ros and the over 9000 varieties of things that can kill you dead from thirty paces  get down to tasmania and look for thylacines you wont find any but you might    jumping great white sharks of south africa
  yes i have done that cage dive with the great whites been on many safaris in tanzania south africa zimbabwe kenya namibia zambia botswana uganda rwanda mozambique seen gorillas i do not support paying to see captured animals   i live in australia so we have wallabies in the backyard and several deadly spiders ect naturally been to many asian countries and seen the pandas orangutans snow monkeys proboscus ect  seen grizzlies in alaska tigers in india galapagos  about to dive with whales sharks in djibouti and see the chimps in uganda  i am looking for unusual ideas  for example the maned wolf in brazil which has a nightly ritual of visiting a monastery  plan to see polar bears and it seems snow leopards are too difficult    yes i was just in the amazon and saw the harpy eagle with eaglet from a specially built platform and the jaguars in the pantanal    i should have gone there when i was in miami but at the time was there for 70000 tonnes of metal and in a different headspace there is so much more to see in the usa at some stage will do a 6month tour of the national parks waiting for the dollar to be more in my favour again
just go and plant diverse forests  were killing all fun animals before going extinct ourselves
  gorilla trekking was my fave followed by walking safari in south luangwa where we were charged by a bull elephant and the ranger had to fire his gun to scare it crazy
  plan to see polar bears  go somewhere where you can see walruses also never actually seen them myself but theyre probably very imressive duo to their size
south georgia island
christmas island
shiretoko peninsula
    like these suggestions thanks
  the train station in paris the amount of monkeys hollering and screeching is just mind boggling
  go see the last exemplar of native european monkey in gibaltrar sure they are so accustomed to humans they know where to look in cars to find food but still
whalewatching
  yes that is a favourite seen many in s africa and even sydney harbour
  anybody have any good ideas  does anyone here travel to see wildlife  what have you seen
  grow up white in south africa  parents take us to the kruger national park every long weekend to see animals  do this for years  the niche of seeing african wildlife quickly wears thin    i honestly want to see a deer
itt items you never travel without
  condoms
  where are you traveling that you need that
you will get diarrhea while traveling its not if its when you need to have this shit with you at all times
  you will get diarrhea while traveling its not if its when     why do people seem to have such weak digestive systems never had an issue abroad though i dont drink soda and generally drink large amounts of water before heading out and always after a night of drinking    pop a daily vitamin and drink some water in the morning before heading out and before bed
  why dont you just drink more water    even singapore bathrooms dont have tp sometimes
do wipes stored in pouches keep their moisture once opened
  water  flavorless crap that doesnt save you soda is better gives you energy for sure came from a corporation where it was safely processed and tastes better besides soda has water in it anyways
  also gives me viscereal fat    id rather just drink sparkling water even if it does make me a faggot
  personally i prefer these charcoal is pretty neat also works if you simply ate too much spicy curry and burn your bumbum or if you had too much fat/oil generally cant go wrong with popping one or two of these if youre on the go and dont want an upset stomach to fuck with your trip
  an airplanes food tray has more bacteria than the shared toilet it sucks to get sick while traveling so its best to be cautious      theres a difference between eating rich food that doesnt agree with you and picking up a shitting bacteria in a third world country      for a while if its resealable close it properly and it will last

hey guys its vlogger anon here if anyone remembers me from about a month ago my trip is almost over in singapore atm on layover and am just shilling my latest vlog     i posted my a link to one of my videos in a thread last month expecting to get roasted but you guys were actually really supportive and helped me double my subscriber count from 30 something to 75 just wanted to say thank you for that     below is my latest video as well as links to the channels of other channels i watch which i think are really high quality and comfy to watch    my latest vid       adv china  most of you guys probably know matt and winston they do motorcycle vlogs exploring china and talking about issues there that westerners would normally never hear about      indigotraveller  another kiwi vlogger is a bit normie but his videos are well edited and he is down to earth he is pretty comfy to watch      erwan heussaff  filipino chef who makes fantastic food travel videos some of the best editing out there and his videos are 10/10 comfy to watch would definitely recommend checking him out he mostly does videos about asia      passport heavy  based black man digital nomad he is some kind of marketer/entrepreneur who pays editors to make videos about his travels the editing on them is better than what ive seen in most hollywood films and he is really down to earth/entertaining to watch      what do you guys watch and what do you think of these guys videos

id been studying abroad and it was nice to talk to some americans my age not in my 8 person study abroad group it was my last day in rome and europe and i had already sort of seen everything that were on my must see list so when they invited me to lunch i said hell yes    we hung out ate gelato and had a really great time    as dinner approached they mentioned they had an extra ticket for the vatican museum trip one of their fellow students was sick and couldnt go and their alumni group already bought them i was super hesitant because i had been the day before and it was just overwhelming and kind of not so awesome very far below my expectations but i really was hitting it off with one of the girls and they promised me dinner afterwards too and a place to crash if the gate for my housing closed before they could get me back    anyways in the entire course of the day no one mentoined that their tour was a private tour i ended up kneeling on the floor of the sistine chapel with 50 other people it was incredible reverent and beautiful to be there without throngs of people trying to take pictures and being shushed i got to soak in the beauty of the museums without worrying about a pick pocket    it was one of the most serendipitous accidental meetings of my life ive stayed in touch with a few of the students too theyre all over the us now
saw a hobo sucking himself off in florence threw him a euro for the show
ill tell you what i regret most    not going on tinder or some shit like that and dating more in florence when i studied there for 5 months last fall    i still got an italian gf which was great but theres nothing like international girls which you cant get back home
was leaving escaping amsterdam after a 4 day smoke binge my train to berlin was leaving in an hour so i thought id have one final smoke before leaving the coffee shop had a special  7 guilders for a coffee and space cake i had one felt a slight buzz and decided to have another the waitress asked if i was sure but i insisted i walked back to the train station and was walking to my train when the space cake kicked in it was like getting hit in the back of the head with a mallet i was so stoned successfully managed to get on my train and then passed out i have vague recollections of showing my eurail pass and passport i woke up about 12 hrs later with a conductor violently shaking me still completely stoned out of my head i stumbled out of the berlin train station and went directly to the first hotel i saw threw down my cc and passed out in my room for another 12 hrs i woke up and checked everything all my stuff was safe and i was fine i decided to check out berlin but noticed all these swiss flags everywhere i asked the man at the front desk excuse me sir but am i in berlin blank stare  no you are in basil switzerland never did make it to berlin but switzerland was nice

get kicked out of a hookers apartment in paris due to a simple misunderstanding of price  traumatize younger sister due to arriving at hotel disgustingly drunk and crawling into one of the beds almost nude and mumbling random shit as she entered with my niece into the room  walking around toronto at night settling into a shitty sports bar and witnessing a bar fight on a sunday  almost falling off a mountain in bernal mexico and being saved by some rando local hiking the footpath  visiting a buddy in utah and driving around the local uni campus in salt lake city to find crustpunks we could pester for substances not many of them sadly
i was careless in picking my current accomodation im waiting for the normie backpackers to finish their breakfast so i can eat in peace
when i was studying abroad in spain one of our planned group excursions got cancelled the program director gave us our money back to do what we wished i decided to go to sevilla     hot as shit at every hour of the day  hear more english german and french than spanish i went on the trip to improve my spanish  every single store front is either a restaurant or souvenir shop  ate one meal and ended up being on the toilet shitting/throwing up for the entire day shat myself like three times
  dont go to paris its even worse there
went to mexico for spring break in 8th grade with my spanish class spent a few days in mexico city taxco and acapulco   one of the guys staying in my room was sick before going on the trip but his parents didnt buy travel insurance so he went anyway he threw up all over our room and kept us up all night with the smell and his back and forth trips to the bathroom the rest of us opened the window and stuck our heads out but the smog wasnt much better than the yack smell  next day he stays at the hotel and the rest of us go to a few churches and shit in the city im starting to feel pretty gross and end up puking my guts up in outside of santa veracruz church on the sunday before easter thank god it was outside though i ended up taking a cab back to the hotel and missed the pyramids that afternoon fuckin sucked   taxco was cool though its kinda crazy that they let a bunch of 13 year olds loose in that town
im pinching my nose bridge even writing this im so embarrassed     i like wandering and doing random shit i have little common sense to begin with   decide to travel to another country solo   having a good time i do my silly shit like climb to the roof of a building sing with a street guitarist shit like that   i decide to buy a rose from one of the old women that has to sell small shit cuz no social safety net for old people for no reason   as i walk a suave guy with a perfect australian accent invites me up to a strip club to give the rose to a girl   say fuck it and do it   shoot the shit with some ukrainian chick as i get a water   i drink a sip of champagne that she has and just unwind talking   as she discusses getting a private room i realize whats going on and demand the bill until they relent   get charged 1200 worth for the glass of champagne i drank   fuckkk   find out their card reader is not working after being on the phone with my bank   i have the money just no way to move it   bank wont let me raise my atm withdrawal limit   i cant wire them money because the wire service detects fraud   finally forced to contact family so they can wire me money   proceed to be held hostage for 12 hours inside the bar as we wait cops are in on it and watch as i try to do all this   weird dog day afternoon moment ensues   owner gave me water and food the whole time and talked about america with me he has a travel visa and visits show biz expos in vegas yearly   his underlings show me family photos and we sing covers of songs at the bar wile the accent guy shows us all the british accents hes learned   owner refused my attempt to pawn the expensive gifts i was going to give my parents because he didnt want that to happen   mom freaks out and demands to see him on video chat he personally assures her of my safety in a super surreal moment   dad calls the embassy and they send agents to watch me as i finish    no more strip clubs m8s
  the time you got fucking lost  sounds like every time ive gone to switzerland its always great though get to see the countryside and meet awesome people like the guy who was training to set the world record for most base jumps in a day
  you were a little vague at parts  what country were you in   why were you charged 1200  im guessing giving the rose to the stripper was code for buying some expensive vip treatment
    it was georgia and i think i fell victim to an emergency scam     the rose didnt mean anything i let the stripper have it after the bullshit began haha she was just playing her part so i wasnt pissed at her
    i think i was charged that for opening the champagne again i think it was a scam but the ramifications were very real
  oh makes sense yeah if you open a fresh bottle even if you specify you just want a glass they can still charge you for it   they pull that shit everywhere happened to me in nyc as well
    thats what i figured and thats also why im not bitching at them as much as myself i was persephone and i ate the proverbial pomegranate seeds by my own decision
  i cant believe there are people like you that exist    great work keeping the scams going
    no problem bruddah just what i do     brofist
i was on a train in paris about this time last year me and my friend were on our way to meet some people down at the moulin rouge i was eating a cup of noodles with a fork id liberated from the hostel when this lovely gent stands up to leave the train sort of half bows with his head down and hands together and ever so gently takes my noodles from me says merci a couple of times and departs the train    i wasnt even mad it was beautiful the way he took them was just great one of my favourite parts of the trip i dont know why it just felt awesome

in japan first time  was out drinking with friends  card fucking up bank attempting to fix it have 5000 yen to my name till the bank unfucks my card in 2448 hours  friends want to go to a movie after drinking then do some karaoke i need to save my cash in case something happens  decide to fuck off grand 2 tall strong zeros and some yakitori from 711 walking back to my hotel from ueno station to kanda figure ill stare at some lights and what not  finish beers definitely feeling it after prior drinking and those 2 9s  standing at the light waiting to cross kinda wandered over near tokyo university a bit dont ask i think it was just me being drunk  qt asian chick comes up wraps her arm around me and says hello there want to come with me and points over to an apartment complex or hotel or something  my drunk ass thinks this is a scam or hooker or something probably would be kinda fucked if all i gave her was like 4000 yen  nah im going to my hostel its over this way  get confused look as she points and says my home there  drunk ass head tells me i should go home and not with her  yeah my hostel is this way i am going to my hostel  looks at me confused as shit and slaps me and storms off  kinda feel like an idiot now that i realize it was probably some college chick gaijin hunter    people still tell me it was probably a hooker or trying to run something but i dunno feels like i missed out on something

  yes because normal women especially gaijin hunters approach men by wrapping their arms around and immediately inviting them for sex youre retarded
  missed out on something  you missed out on being accused of rape/having your kidney stolen college chick gaijin hunters go to the hub
  college chick gaijin hunters go to the hub  lmao no they dont
  fuck yeah they do my dude depends heavily on which one you go to  takadanobaba hub has waseda students akihabara hub has medical shibuya hub is just sluts in general chiba hub sucks ass dont bother shinjuku hub always has too many guys wanting to practice drunken english suidobashi/tokyo dome hub is an odd one harajuku hub has freaks roppongi hub is pure cancer other ones cant remember but nonchain irish pubs are even better if youre in the mood for some low hanging no strings attached fun otherwise you can go to gaitomo international parties  like shooting fish in a barrel if your standards are ass
  nice larp
travelling with wife to nyc in a month we are visiting family by we want to enjoy nye ourselves alone    we dont want to see the ball drop o stay near times square  we want to eat something drink some and maybe dance    recomendations
  sounds like you should google what restaurants bars and night clubs are near your hotel retard
try a russian mafia hangout restaurant in brighton beach
i am in college and there is a program in california that comes with either homestay or shared housing with other college students i am a 24 year old male though and this is the first time i am leaving my country to study abroad    i think i should go with the family so i learn more about the culture and practice english but i am worried about my age perhaps the shared dorms is a be a better option for my age group    how are homestay families in the us
  youll enjoy the shared housing more
is there anything from canada on here who has done a work holiday visa in europe specially in germany    i want to know a few things about the process     1 when you book an appointment how late is it usually after to actually get the appointment  2 do you need proof that the government authorizes you to be away more than 183 days and retain coverage or will proof of healthcare insurance suffice
do you ever try to dress like a local when youre in another country
  generally i dont tend to try and embarress myself the only thing you should really dress for is the environment/weather
i dont dress like a local but i try not to dress like a tourist pic related    as has been mentioned here many times not wearing shorts gets you treated very differently in many countries if the average local dude on the street is wearing pants then you should wear them too    in cities i normally pack some smart clothing so i can go to some nice bars and restaurants without feeling underdressed
  i go full on trashy tourist loose buttonup short sleeve with bathing suit trunks
  so average british tourist
  if you dont have a bucket hat you are a poser
i look hispanic so when im in latin america i throw on jeans and a soccer jersey and i usually get left alone whilst my friends get bombarded with the usual stuff
nah im white lived in india for a while and generally just travel to thirdworld and developing countries i usually wear darkcolored jeans with proper shoes and a buttondown folks usually assume im either an expatriate or a fairskinned affluent local in countries like colombia or mexico    i realized a few years back that my change in style also prompted autorickshaw drivers in india to stop asking first time in india to youre working here studying
  thats the point bucko
i just wear a t shirt and jeans everywhere
  this tshirt  tourist  tshirts make you look like a mouthbreathing retard the only adults who wear them are in us/central america mostly only teenagers wear them outside these regions
    will also add that the only time i dress like a local is when its contextually appropriate for instance ill wear a kurta if im invited to an indian wedding or am required to wear one for a diwali event otherwise i just feel sorta awkward dressing up in another cultures clothes
  t manchild
  if stupid printed tshirt  yes  i wear plain t shirts slim cut v neck and dark blue jeans and sneakers plain stan smith/gazelle like its like fucking basic and you do not stand out anywhere the only exterior display is a nice watch and that allows you to always be welcome in the upper class circles even if you are not trying hard with a button shirt
what the fuck is wrong with tshirts theyre far more comfy than button up shirts and polo shirts even
  they make you look like a big child
  trying hard with a button shirt  the absolute state of americans
  no because there is no advantage to looking like a local unless im just trying to avoid getting robbed or kidnapped and in such cases im still not going to pass for a local to a professional criminal so the best i can do is try not to look like a mark and most of that comes down to behavior and not apparel within reason    i dont think you need to worry about not looking like a degenerate if youre hanging out on khao san road because everyone knows you are one already    cringe    i dont think you know what a nice watch is    nothing context is everything you see locals in tshirts all over southeast asia everywhere from the most run down night markets of manila to some of the nicer areas in singapore you also see poorer working people service industry and small business owners in collared buttonfront shirts although an absolute homeless street urchin is still most likely to be be in a tshirt rich european cities have locals in tshirts poor brown countries have locals in tailored jackets and dress shoes    what makes you stand out is being a 64 white guy in a crowd of 53 brown guys and dressing like indiana jones isnt going to make you fit in no matter how many layers of ethnic garb you put on the best advice is to dress respectfully as in respect for both yourself and your surroundings which is going to vary depending on if youre shopping in high end stores in a capital city vs hanging out on the beach in some poor backwater
i dress like i always do at home
i dress as modest as possible it does help much less people try to rip me off than they do other tourists around me
  not american      i have a rolex 16600 an omega po 42 on metal among other more modest tissot or hamiltoni dont expect to be lectured on nice watches on /trv/
  that picture makes me sad  i hope hes achieved some of the things he wanted to in life
  trying hard with a button shirt
im wearing shorts here in india all the time sure i get a lot of looks but ive seen a couple of locals in shorts in urban areas and a lot of the more traditional men are wearing that cloth that barely covers their knees    when the women stare at my legs i like to imagine that theyre eyeing my bulge
  i meant a pig in a dress is still a pig  a button shirt doesnt automatically means you have class people can rock a t shirt and jeans and be more acceptable in a chic environment than your average /trv/ lurker wearing button shirts khakis and sensible running shoes kek
  i never said it did exude class in the first place just that places outside america tshirts make you stand out
  wearing a nice watch makes you welcome in more discerning circles  thinking buying expensive watches  class  the absolute autism on this board sometimes
  ita not about class its about staff and patrons recognizing your purchase power and not batting an eye at you for wearing casual/basic wear in a upper class setting   im the autist for not overdressing for fear god forbids i may be taken for a tourist
  except it does not it really baffles me how you guys can be so anal about a plain fitted tshirt
  look a tourist
  what he thinks he looks like  vs  
  headed to mexico right now hell no i dont evem want to be here im sure as shit not getting 3 foot long pointy shoes and a sombrero and im too fat for a belt buckle at any rate
  how you dont even make sense anymore moving goalposts at every reply yes we are still 18 itt you guys are hopeless
  being jelly 24/7    the absolute state of 3rd world shithole dwellers
  
  look at all those people standing out i can see everyone of them
  classy gentleman right there
  hes clearly trying too hard some fedora neckbeard
button shirts button shirts everywhere
i guess it depends where you travel if you are in areas with no white collar workers like these pictures then you should also slum it if youre in tokyo or going around the fancy malls and bars of hong kong or bangkok you probably dont want to dress so pleb    so long as youre not an embarrassment to your nationality like so many brits germans aussies french and americans then youre doing ok
  if youre running around fancy places wearing business clothes on a sunday morning youre the one who looks like a pleb    adults know how to dress down nobody thinks your haggar noniron shirt makes you look like a ceo on his day off
  are you suggesting the people in those photos look good/not poor    obviously you expect that at flea markets im not saying you dont but im not going to dress badly just because there are poo people around i dont do that back home so why do it abroad
  dressing inappropriately is dressing badly if youre hanging out in a pampangan fish market in july its more appropriate to be in a tshirt and some kind of casual pants or shorts preferably not too expensive looking likewise if youre in a michelinstarred restaurant in cannes dont go in there wearing an oversize basketball jersey and timberlands with the antitheft tag still attached if you have a better alternative in your suitcase    most people ultimately are going to be too interested in their own business to give a shit how you look so stop overthinking this you arent going to succeed in passing yourself off as something that youre not so dont try the only times to really worry are is theres an actual dress code or if youre on a business trip or if youre actually at risk of getting kidnapped or assaulted
  the point of the other retard was that a t shirt makes you stand out those pictures make it clear anyone with a tshirt would blend in will you stop moving the goalposts
we should really be showing developing countries how to dress well not lowering ourselves to their standards    men should want to be you women should want to be with you
  you just have to be white and decent for that kek
  t
  ah i see decent is out of your vocabulary
  i just try to not look rich  that means plain old clothes worn down shoes and no flashy watch or jewelery people may still assume you are rich in some places because you can afford the plane ticket to travel there but you cant change that obviously
    cringe    sorry should i take to wearing ethnic apparel in my daytoday life
  it seems he knows better than you what a nice watch is
  yeah this has never worked from my experience people will assume you have money or not based on your nationality not how well you dress
  imagine being this hungry for validation over your watch typical rolex owner
  i wish i had a rolex   i do have a seiko 5 tho looking at a oris after i graduate to get into swiss made i rarely see someone who can afford a rolex hating on rolexes tho
  you dont talk to watch people obviously     i had an explorer but i got rid of it couldnt handle the stigma desu    i have a cartier santos for dressing in my monkey suit and a seiko landmaster spring drive for most days
  almost every collector i see in the forums i browse have at least one rolex if not several along with other brands often less famous to the large audience yet more expensive than rolexes  i find it weird that wearing a rolex makes you feel incomfortable when 99 of the population cant even tell a rolex from a seiko unless they get to inspect it closely and see the brand
  is that ah oh huh  thats why  rolex owners live for those moments  its gross and youre not convincing anyone that it doesnt happen
i refuse to believe that picture is real its gotta be from a skit or something
    youre killing it lol  standing out wearing a plain tshirt just lol
  i tend to dress slightly more than casual and less than business casual when im in europe and east asia i skip out on the tshirts at least    i just wear tshirts and jeans/shorts in third world countries though
  tfw /fit/  fuck i look better than that guy does i should become a hanes model
  do you also have a 10 inch dick
  only 6 sadly
  of course  thongs both kinds and a bright yellow football jersey in rio brazil always
military boots  burzum long sleeve shirt  jeans    fuck everyone cry me a river
i try to be as american as possible
when i went to ghana i dressed in full african garb made out of kente cloth which is traditional to west africa the locals absolutely loved it and somebody even bought me a whole new ghanaian outfit so that id have a spare cultural appropriation is an absolute meme if you show a genuine interest in the culture and ask people to teach you about it then people normally react very positively by the end of it i was even joking with them that i was a colonial ruler come to return their nation to british rule and they were laughing and joking along with me good times
  they were just being nice
  yes west africans are a very nice and welcoming people i made lots of friends several of whom im still in touch with also had lots of people sending me messages every day asking for money but cest la vie
    going to africa ever    nope
whats the weather like in midwinter    i have a 25 week break from work and ill be in area thinking about slovenia croatia macedonia albania and kosovo as ive already been to serbia and bosnia a couple times    without doing research i feel like slovenia will be the only one i really have to bring alot of winter clothes for     im canadian btw
  estonia
there is nothing to do here in winter maybe in slovenia if you like skiing ice climbing or snow hiking
  the coast is relatively calm around 210 degrees celsius and the inland varies from 1 to 6 on flat ground to 15 to 5 on hills and mountains    so its dependent on your tastes just so you know only serbia and bosnia get a lot of snow every winter unless you were planning to hike triglav paklenica or valbona or something
  you can go to zlatibor and get absolutely shitfaced but yeah its really boring here in winter makes for some comfy walks though
  go to slovenia in december its pretty comfy in ljubljana
  define mid winter it depends on which month you mean as we get snows in different months here in slovenia than what you might experience in canada
  not op but im also in the balkans seeing family over christmas     tell me more about this zlatibor place
  yeah forgot to say that in the post    mid january to early february
  planica zlata lisica
  its a mountain where a lot people go for a weekend to drink and snort cocaine you can rent something for cheap by western standards and the unis here often organize group trips there so youll have hundreds of 1822 year old whores available
where is objectively the most comfy train ride
  trenitalias executive class seats on the frecciarossa trains are comfy af
gran class on the shinkansen
rer c aux heures chelou quand mehmet sort un couteau pour te piquer ta bouteille dice tea  ça cest folklore
objectively the premier train from cape town to joburg private booth with beds24h of old school full board relaxed traveling through south africas nature  cant recommend enough
my buddy flies to las vegas regularly buys a bunch of marijuana edibles then flies home with them to our state georgia where weed is illegal     he claims its perfectly safe they even check your bags at the airport in las vegas can see you have it and dont care     i really like edibles they help with some aches and pains that i get regularly i would like to fly out there pick up a few months worth of thc edibles and then fly home but im worried that what my friend is doing is actually a big risk and could end me up in jail    anyone know about this
100 illegal and also a federal crime
idk man ive read on a few blogs that as long as its edible and its carry on your chances of getting in trouble are zero
          lol     drug smuggling on a federal level  is this a crime
  test
  he claims its perfectly safe they even check your bags at the airport in las vegas can see you have it and dont care    so they unzipped his luggage once didnt see it and let him go happens with a lot of things doesnt mean its fine    your friend is bullshitting you it is still federally illegal and trafficking it into another state is stupidly illegal youre life is in your hands to get a little dude weed lmao    i really like edibles they help with some aches and pains that i get regularly  man if only tylenol or some other easily cheap to get pain killer could solve this
  anyone know about this    you probably wont get caught go for it
  man i certainly wouldnt fucking fly itll be much less risky if you drive alternatively you could just move south to jax and get a medical card
its not legal but it literally doesnt matter ive flown all over the world with edibles its almost impossible to catch properly ive had edibles in east asia se asia india the levant dubaiyes dubai most of europe and some parts of south america of course i also fly to many different states in the us for the type of quality shit i get in my state you wont know its an edible unless its eaten no smell at all i usually buy gummy types and just put them in a regular gummy packet mixed with normal ones the people going crazy over this are the types to sit at a red light on an empty road at 3 am ie slaves
so theres this neat thing now called a drug dealer they take on the risk they take on all the paranoia and stress and you pay them a small premium in exchange for minimized risk    you can usually find them by asking your friends    of course if you are too autistic for this then enjoy doing amateur hour drug trafficking go directly to court say goodbye to ever getting a real job ever in your life
  lol this is idiotic in most countries its much more dangerous and risky trying to get weed from a local drug dealer than it is just taking it with you if you dont want any risks dont do drugs if you want drugs dont listen to this dumbass above me
  t retard who thinks people buy from the undercovers in washington square park
  if youre traveling to a new state or country you dont have friends to hook you up with a non cop non gang member non flakey and non multiple felony substance pushing drug dealer let alone the rarity of even finding that in most non legal states with friends quality and price is also much worse outside of america and some parts of europe its even worse and more dangerous go buy some weed in china brazil the me eastern europe or africa as a tourist enjoy yourself and make sure you have enough cash to pay the ransom or a crooked cop those guys thrive on dumbasses like you
  if youre traveling to a new  except this guy is talking about where he lives brainlet the entire point of my post is that buying drugs in strange places and then flying with them is something only retards would do seems like you two have a lot in common
  hell be safercop and crime wise save money and obtain higher quality weed by just buying it in vegas and flying it home or even buying a large quantity and driving home you have two risks in georgia over zealous military worshipping cops searching for an opportunity to wear their tactical gear and take a drug bust pic and black gang members looking for any opportunity to scam or rob you
just buy some weed and cook it yourself its a pointless risk for a pointless drug
  no smell at all  youve got to just be noseblind to it the gummies i got in colorado stank just like weed
  keep doing it sooner or later you will be caught in a place like singapore and be literally given the death penalty
  i dont do it anymore because i dont smoke weed anymore not because of your bullshit acting like im smuggling in a pound of cocaine up my ass lmao ill love to see those singaporeans search my gummies ive been through other death penalty counties already you are the type of people this kind of conditioning works on always surprised that slave like mindsets are so damn common think about what they actually do not what they say or what you think or what youve heard and then proceed from there what do they actually do with edibles absolutely nothing most of those peopleespecially asians dont even know it exists its like not bringing a bible to india because its officially banned and can incur penalties
  not worth the risk if you suffer chronic pain that warrants regular cannabis use it may be worthwhile for you to move to a state where its legal
  or just drive make a road trip out of it as long as you arent carrying so much quantity you can smell it fuming out the car 50ft away you should be fine ive literally never had a cop search my car in a traffic stop before and i doubt its that common for most people i was pulled over by a cop with a bong in a backpack between my legs and a a bag of weed under my ass on fucking 420 and he was none the wiser you have to he a real dumbass to get caught
god damn dude weed is not worth all that much its easy as fuck to detect and very very illegal im all for bending the rules especially if theres no big chance of getting caught or severely fucked over but if you get caught smuggling weed you will be severely fucked over for some fucking weed
obviously its illegal and dumb but a lot probably depends on quantity one or two brownies or something probably wont get you jailed but the quantities youre talking about will i routinely brought small amounts of coke with me on flights from sf to vegas in carry on never once had an issue though im sure it was noticed one or twice bottom line is the tsas not looking for small amounts of drugs they more than likely will just toss it if they find it but if you try to bring a fucking pound of edibles back with yougood luck with that el chapo
  perfectly safe isnt a good phrase to use  local police search you nothing bad happens  airport security searches you nothing bad happens  tsa searches you shit can happen here  federal police search you shit can also happen here    not  but i guess theres probably a ratio of special gummies to regular gummies you can probably mix so the smell isnt as bad
  dude weed lmao anyone who cares about the law is a slave
  cares about law    as if anybody in this thread doesnt take drugs on planes because they believe in the morals behind the law and dont just want to go to jail lmao fuck off you fall for the security charade and submit to the impressions people in power give you you are a slave even knowing the chance of being caught is almost zero you still (((choose))) to abide by a law you dont believe in

been to india ten times turkey thrice and mexico twice going back to colombia for a second time near the end of november     plans     march 2019 week in guatemala el salvador or other latin american country with cheap airfare  considering dominican republic too but ive never been a beaches and island kinda guy     summer 2019  couple weeks in china since uncle lives in shanghai   might see another city or two fly to singapore visit friend for three or four days  fly to dhaka bangladesh and spend week there before crossing border to india and spending 152 months there     summer plan is very liable to change considering that ive little interest in chinese history and culture however itd be nice to experience a place like shanghai without having to pay for accommodation     tbqh i really want to take a motorcycle trip to at least panamaand maybe even argentinabeginning next may but i just dont know whether ill actually have the time to do it
  youve been to kazakhstan but not russia also how was iraq
    i had a flight into almaty and a few days i was just transiting from india to turkey and thought id take advantage of the cheap ticket having a wonky long layover in almaty     iraq was okay i went in 2013 before the rise of isis only did kurdistan although i think i briefly left the region while passing mosul pretty boring place although the people were incredibly awfully nice
  how old are you
im surprised this works well with mobile
    25
  going to turkey soon what are your best tips    born in us 21 and never traveled alone before always with family or school trip    considering getting a motorcycle license before i go so i can rent a motorcycle and can go where i want tell me if this is retarded    i want to go to ankara istanbul bursa and izmir in that order on a 90 day visa
    tips regarding what compared to most of my recent travel destinations turkeys pretty easy tier will it be your first time outside of europe or another western country     just reread your post and saw thatmy bad    turks on the whole are friendly people the only places i felt harassed by touts and con artists were in touristic districts of istanbulsultanahmet specifically near the hagia sophia and grand bazaar and beyoglus istiklal caddesi and taksim square by and large the worst youll encounter are forceful merchants and friendly strangers intent on taking your money read the wikitravel page on scams that should prepare you    i did meet a vietnamese guy who said he got taken to an underground bar he ordered a few beers and was given a 500 euro tab a few musclemen tried to intimidate him but he just laughed and showed that he had the equivalent of 15 in his wallet     why do you want to go to ankara its a pretty new city and doesnt offer much granted i didnt spend much time there except in passing but i dont think id have wanted to either are you planning to see pamukkale cappadocia or any similar places traveling around turkey by bus is easy affordable and surprisingly comfortable     i dont know much about motorcycle rentals in turkey not sure whether id recommend doing it i learned to ride in new delhi though and never had a single accident until last summer bear in mind that as an inexperienced rider youve a greater risk of dropping the bike stalling out or doing other retarded noob things its by no means a guarantee riding in turkey isnt nearly as challenging as egypt tanzania india etc but you shouldnt expect other drivers to respect your lane or space     i wont give you a recommendation one way or another i definitely wouldnt sweat it but ive also been riding for a few years best advice i can give is just to take your riding skills course buy a beater and practice as much as youcan
    tips regarding your favorite thing you did/saw or things that you learned specific to turkey which are unique anything that struck you since you have been 3 times    ive been around the us quite a bit with family and to london paris vatican florence and rome for a school trip but nothing that ive had to plan out myself beside small friend group trips and certainly nothing challenging    i know ankara is boring however i have friends who live there so i wanna see them  yeah other than those 4 cities i didnt plan on seeing anywhere else but ill add them to my notes and do research to work them in thanks    yeah i guess ill stick to the buses i was trying to figure out the best way to be as flexible as possible because i have anxiety and a bad track record about being punctual so i wouldve liked to only worry about the plane
  are you planning on using up the whole 90 days if so youll want to go further east where theres a lot more to see theres not really much to do in bursa so i wouldnt go out of my way to see it but fair enough if youre passing through or have friends there visiting the south east would be top of my list its the most unique region of turkey and feels the least westernised mardin diyarbakir nemrut dag midyat urfa and harran are all worth a visit there     i wouldnt recommend the motorbike for you if you have anxiety turkish drivers are by no means the worst ive come across on my travels but theres very little respect for the rules of the road the bus network is extremely extensive so you shouldnt really have problems there but if you really want flexibility then id rent a car youre still at the mercy of other drivers but you might feel a little safer than on a bike flights are also plentiful and cheap between cities if you dont fancy massive journeys but not necessary if you have 90 days
  keep your time in izmir limited or skip it entirely its not a great city sprawling ugly depressing and not much to see use it as a base to see aphrodisias if you have to but then get out
    i would agree with the two anons who posted after you especially on izmirits a boring city the stretch of oceanside road and entertainment is alright but there isnt much to do in and around the city iirc there are some ruins you can hike to in the neighboring hills    southeast turkey is indeed quite interestingi hitchhiked and traveled around the region before and after entering iraq while the area is a bit restive its also an extremely hospitable region if youre young and want to try hitchhiking you wont have to wait for rides people are generally quite kind although you might be sexually propositioned by men if you look sufficiently foreign regardless of whether youre male or female     diyarbakir is a little sketchy at least around the old citys walls still interesting place i would recommend at least passing through the region if you have the chance     turkey was actually my firstever country back in 2013 i was 19 then and wound up right down the road from the gezi park and taksim square protests in may even after choking on tear gas and seeing turkish police brutalize protesters i still have a mostly positive impression of the country     definitely do some searching and research to see where else you can go aside from cities you can do pamukkale on the way from ankara to izmir if you do opt to go that way
    izmir  boring    you obviously didnt go with a girl then turkey in general is best enjoyed as a couple not solo or in a stag group maybe with the exception of marmaris but even then
feels europe man
rate
  i went with a girl to izmir other anons are right skip it its shit
lacks variety
heres the real travaler map use this more accurate
  youre in maine youre basically in canada already    t upstate new yorker
  respect anon
very proud of my full set of hungarian counties
  gay map
too lazy to fill out the countries visited in light green  still a lot of places i didnt go now that i see it
      is the light red your home province or a region in your country you havent visited there should be a separate category
  or a region in your country you havent visited  this  on the most recent version of this map theres a live now color to avoid confusion
  how is turkey best with a girl im considering taking my gf there after some euro destinations prior to heading home im an afghan vet so i think turkey would be a massive culture shock to her whichll be amusing
  huh i thought its supposed to be the home province
  i went with a girl too its a good city but it is boring relative to the rest of turkey
going to the green this month
  just drive there nigga go to montreal or moncton
im trying to plan a honeymoon around two weeks long next november somewhere that wont be too cold in late november would be nice and i would like to do a little bit of hiking    on my list right now is patagonia new zealand japan spain i have family there greece any suggestions
how long do you think you should have lived in a region in order to color in that youve lived there
  i define lived as if you worked and paid rent somewhere or otherwise existed there for reasons other than selfindulgement
  what about studying
    jewgle has fewer than half the countries ive visited had an iphone from 2014 through july 2018 so nothing got recorded for nearly four years
not including layovers of course i travelled between china and ukraine just by train then jordan palestine and israel was just by bus/train next year i plan on going by rail through china the stans chechnya the caucuses turkey and ending in greece probably will be my last major extended trip there is a nuclear option where i go through lebanon syria iraq iran afghanistan pakistan and end in india going by land but this is very unlikely for me to do    really wanting to do shorter trips to ethiopia japan peru colombia morocco  spain  portugal and india
  nno bully pls
trappedineuropepng    planning on backpacking through central asia and maybe on to india and sea if my budgetll allow it next year once i finish college
europe
  asia
  north america
  south america
im still a novice traveller went to japan last year and mexico this year to visit a friend i met in japan next year i want to go to hong kong and maybe see more of china technically i was was in shanghai for one day but i just went from the airport to a hotel and back     i am 28 y/o
  however i have done a bit of us travel to make up for it a little less than halfway done
  did you do eurasia continuously by land how did you avoid russia take any boats do you recommend that also what order is the best to do the stans
  i liked the underground cities of cappadocia but i like old buildings everywhere not sure if it is for everyone      i was in germany for two years but i never worked or studied there or had anything more than a 3 month tourist visa or managed to learn much german but i count it as lived because two years is a long time
heres where ive been i think its dumb to put where you want to visit especially in my case because i want to visit a shitload of places
  flew to tbilisi ferried from baku to aktau flew back from almaty the rest was over land would have been easier and with a russian visa but i didnt have one i dont think the order matters much only recommendations are to do the pamir highway east to west and if youre paranoid go to azerbaijan before artsakh    georgia  easy and cheap to get around lots of english speakers and tours if you need tbilisi is great even for a few months cheap batumi is boring tho best food in the world     azerbaijan  nice people in the countryside no free hitchhiking pretty racist and sexist even for a muslim country dont bring your girlfriend watch out for scammers and taxi guys typical middle eastern food a little more expensive than georgia    armenia  similar to georgia a little less touristy great food also same price as georgia    artsakh  harder than armenia but people are nice lots of free meals and the first car will pick you up hitchhiking every time get the stamp on another paper or else youll be banned from azerbaijan stay in the normal towns with actual stuff otherwise theres nothing to see and police will bother you also if youre fucking around on your own keep an eye out for mine signs food and shit is a little more expensive than armenia    kazakhstan  huge as fuck mostly steppe youll need to pick an area to see or be ready to take a lot of trains from major cities youll need to take tours or rent a car cause most stuff doesnt have public transport no free hitchhiking in central asia food in kazakhstan is hit and miss about as cheap as georgia cities are as developed as eastern europe    kyrgyzstan  lots of great rock formations and lakes and shit you can do pretty much everything by foot or on public transport karakol region is one of my favorite places great food but a couple nasty dishes too bishkek is boring tho    tajikistan  nice mountains and people only worth a few days tho dushanbe is ok    1/2
  gorno badakhshan  poorest and worst developed i liked it but be ready to shit in holes in the ground tons of old petroglyphs fortresses pyramids shrines etc and really beautiful nature lots of hot springs no scheduled public transport only shared taxis super good food nice people besides taxi drivers be ready to barter a lot    uzbekistan  flat boring desert no natural stuff at all lots of old historic shit museums original koran etc but once youve seen 5 mosques and masoleums its kinda boring worth a few days at the most lots of annoying autistic taxes and registration and shit surprisingly touristy but mostly aimed towards muslims    my favorite places to explore were karakol/issykul area artsakh and the pamir highway favorite cities were tbilisi ganja and yerevan    best food kurutop khachipuri zhinglovian hats tandir samsi ashlianfu chinese meat lagman    tell me which places youre interested in and i can tell you cool stuff to do
  sorry do the pamir highway west to east
need to get some southern hem countries checked off
  yes thanks for getting back to me i am planning to go by rail from china been before so this part is easy to kazakhstan work a year in kazakhstan teaching english and then travel through the stans russia been also but not this part through chechnya and then the caucuses ending in turkey or maybe in greece after turkey     my impression is that this can all be done by rail and maybe a bit of bus in relation to chinese and russian trains how comfortable and easy to use are these trains what was the ferry like is it something you need to book in advance you hitchhiked the whole way about howmuch time and money was this trip all together how was the availability of hostels and hotels similar to eastern europe    in terms of languages i know english spanish and arabic well plus a little chinese and russian too i figure i will work hard on my russian before and during the trip plus the year in kazakhstan then maybe pick up a tiny bit of turkish for turkey i assume between turkey and china i will be fine with just english and russian is that overly optimistic    also why no visit to turkmenistan    also for reference i am this guy    i met a lot of stanis in slav land look eurasian and am muslim so i figure i will feel pretty comfortable with people along the way
also i asked about the route because i dont see how i can do the stans if my starting point is kazakhstan without going through kazakhstan a second time     also good nature stuff like hiking and especially swimming in fresh water opportunities would be cool
just back from haiti probably done traveling for the year next year going back to mexico otherwise nothing planned yet
speaking of i might have time off work come march/april next year what countries would be best to visit
  similar maps to yours also never bothered with nz i keep asking every kiwi i meet about it in th hopes they can get me hyped for it but they always just blindly mention how the south island is nice and that auckland is really busy    march/april is still going to be very cold/snowy in a lot of northern hemisphere places
25yo here rate    red done  teal to do cause ive heard good thing    i dont want to check a whole country like india just because ive seen parts of it and yet i guess i shoukd plan laos/chiang mai/burma/assam/bangladesh trip to make the map look better
  when did you do syria and iraq did you make it in one trip and go by land i really want to go but dont want to be isised plus everytime immigration stops me they make sure that i havent been to either of these countries or yemen three or four times
  when will you visit actually interesting countries
    im  and have stamps from iraq on the first page of my passport the only place that constantly hassles me about them is canada
  such as
  swazi land
  what did you do in haiti
  also i asked about the route because i dont see how i can do the stans if my starting point is kazakhstan without going through kazakhstan a second time     depends where youre leaving from kazakhstan has the cheapest flights and is visa free for most countries so its not a big deal to go twice but tajikistan uzbekistan and kyrgyzstan are all touching so you can avoid it too theres also a ferry from turkmenistan but fuck that    also good nature stuff like hiking and especially swimming in fresh water opportunities would be cool    karakol salty lake was my favorite place to swim you can float like in the dead sea issykul is good too but its kinda chilly even in summer at the same time you can see an abondened shipyard and torpedo testing facility and prezawalskis museum and grave pamir highway has good hikes and pools where you can swim along the river lots of hot springs too garm chashma is the best
  my impression is that this can all be done by rail and maybe a bit of bus  for long distances rail is good for short busses are usually simpler and easier i only went by train in kazakhstan when it took longer than a day to get somewhere often you need to book like a week in advance uzbekistan and tajikistan there are more shared taxis than busses in some places no busses at all and in uzbekistan they dont run past 10pm or something so dont take night busses there in kyrgyzstan and tajikistan no trains really  in relation to chinese and russian trains how comfortable and easy to use are these trains  havent been to these countries i imagine theyre similiar booking tickets in person is kind of a pain in the ass but most you can book online top bunk towards the back of the cabin is best in summer cause youll get a nice breeze bring a 2l bottle to prop the window open the more expensive luxurty cabins are kind of a waste just a bit cleaner but otherwise the same watch out for the cheapest tickets cause sometimes you wont have a bed to yourself just a seat bring some food or vodka to share if you want but people will give you stuff either way  what was the ferry like is it something you need to book in advance  theres no schedule you call or go to the port give them your number and theyll call you when a ship is leaving usually every few days its only a little cheaper than flying in summer its really hot but you can say youve done it and the food is good  you hitchhiked the whole way about howmuch time and money was this trip all together  only armenia and georgia are free in the other countries you should pay its cheap and useful though lots of places dont have busses everyone with space will pick you up
  how was the availability of hostels and hotels similar to eastern europe  all towns no matter how small will have somewhere to stay i prefer homestays  in terms of languages i know english spanish and arabic well plus a little chinese and russian too i figure i will work hard on my russian before and during the trip plus the year in kazakhstan then maybe pick up a tiny bit of turkish for turkey i assume between turkey and china i will be fine with just english and russian is that overly optimistic  90 of people speak russian english is hit or miss  also why no visit to turkmenistan  you need a guided tour all the time like nk or iran its like 3000 and not that interesting
i notice a lot of you are using an outdated version of the real travelers map update it to this which is the most recent one for the greater good
and here is mine no future travel plans atm except maybe visiting my friend in york after new years
been to  pic related  want to go  everywhere    strong in europe and asia i will get round to doing the middle east africa and south america before i die    i really need to go to deutschland also
  i would be based in almaty and plan to start the big trip after being a year in kazakhstan ill try to visit as much as i can of kazakhstan during that year and then be ready to leave it entirely after the year    i heard the dead sea is terrible for swimming in and uncomfortable so i am skeptical about the salt lake you mention so then with the trains you should book them in person at the station they use whats app there any good map apps for the area i was using yandex for russia      what about the transit visa to turkmenistan so you dont recommend wasting my time learning any turkic language i was thinking of just doing the turkish pimsleur half assedly while there to be ready when i get to turkey because i expect people to speak to me as if im a local often then i might understand the really simple stuff and transition to russian for other stuff    also i heard tajiks have a bad reputation for being drunk and kind of mean among stanis is that true how safe are these countries in general i would imagine between me and eastern european countries
  went there with a pkk convoy to cross the border last may
still lots of places i want to see im only 23 tho so in a few years this map should be much more filled in
  why is that
where should i go next im thinking worst korea or india only worry about india is that ill go there for a week and starve to death because ill be too afraid to eat their food
    i would like to take this opportunity to express my admiration for your work thank you anon

  which was fucking bullshit  completely agree france has shipped colonials there for decades now to fuck up the referendum only so they can keep control over the nickel mines appalling really    bougainvile will have their turn in june  i know at least theyre not cucked by colonials so theyll most likely vote yes only worry is png deciding youre not ready for independence here have a peacekeeping force instead or some shit only hope then is australia intervening like they did with ramsi in the solomon islands the only fucking peacekeeping force in the history of the world that ever did what it was supposed to    anyway with brexit also happening 2019 will be an interesting year for potential new countries

  lower part of the altai mountains near the katun river in the summer theres literally millions of these fucking butterflies around beautiful at first but annoying after a while
  all the orange flowers in the photo there are extremely endangered species this part of russia is the only place in the world you can find them in such high volume
this was at the summit of one of the mountains i cant recall the name
this was on a plateau that sloped down into this valley with an extrmely remote tourist place only way you can get there is either with a jeep like my fiances father had or by horse
tfw europe trip is almost over
i want to visit ceylan next

  how was the amazonas did you almost die
  it was fun i wish i could have stopped in more small towns along the way the amazon has incredible beaches check out alter do chão  white sand beaches and the darkish black amazon water you can ride with buffalos on ilha do marajo and belem and manaus are fun cities but probably the most run down cities ive seen in brazil i actually felt pretty safe in northern brazil traveling by boat in a hammock is a bit of a meme the landscape looks exactly the same for 95 of the day and the only interesting times are sunrise and sunset  i had a couple of amazing ones sleeping is awkward because you need to hug daypack if i was to do it again i would bring something to read and load my phone up with tv shows i didnt prepare at all the ship generally goes at 20km/h but before belem it went to 13km/h so you will die of boredom     theres interesting stuff in northern brazil too like monte alegre oldest cave paintings of south america or fordlandia a town henry ford built for rubber production    quality of the jungle tours is not so great if you dont pay a lot if you want to see animals go to the pantanal amazon is more for plants and trees     from manaus you can go to santa elena in venezuela and do the roraima trek still regret i didnt do it
  besides syria and iraq these are all meme countries only missing the philippines and japan
still got a ton of the world to see
how hard is it to get a work visa do you need a passport to work on an international cruise ship should you put passport ownership on a resume for outofcountry job applications how can i give myself an edge over poos
   how hard is it to get a work visa  depends on where and for what     do you need a passport to work on an international cruise ship  ask the cruise ship probably not if you stay on the ship but if you expect to get off and see stuff for sure you wont be allowed without it     should you put passport ownership on a resume for outofcountry job applications  why bother its not like its hard to get a passport unless youre from north korea or china or some other thirdworld dictatorship that blocks its citizens from traveling     how can i give myself an edge over poos  be a nonpoo
  how hard is it to get a work visa  not hard depends on how cheap you want to go    do you need a passport to work on an international cruise ship  generally yes    should you put passport ownership on a resume for outofcountry job applications  if working internationally most of the places will have ability to obtain a passport    how can i give myself an edge over poos  by willing to work for the same low pay that they do protip if youre in any country in the us/eu youre living the good life in terms of pay unless you do contractual work for your company overseas unless you are working something very skilled dont bother assuming you will have a better life working internationally
  how hard is it to get a work visa  depends entirely on what country youre coming from what country youre going to what job youre doing and how long you want to stay  a canadian getting a temporary whv to go push a mop at a hostel in new zealand pretty easy to get an american trying to get a permanent visa to go to bangladesh and manage a call center more difficult to acquire
fucking bed bugs arrrrrgh everything hurts
i wonder if i really never encountered bed bugs or i just didnt realise they were bed bugs i slept in every kind of place from 1 or free third world dorms to 1000 hotels lots of different countries and types of cities nothing as of yet
  even shitty places will get rid of bed bugs when they occur however cheaper places attract a cheaper crowd who may bring bed bugs with them  think of it like rng with the dice bonus or malus depending on where you stay
  70 of people dont feel the bites of bed bugs you could think it were mosquito bites if you noticed and yes they arent really that common i encountered them maybe only a few times
  this is what you get for being a real traveller
  i certainly hoped you reported it to management then scorched them on social media
  most people encounter mites not bedbugs most bed bugs you can see and are almost kept in moist climates with people spending days in bed bed bugs you can generally see most of the time you get a flea mite or general itch and go ewwwwwww bed bug noooooo    they do happen but you cant not know about a bed bug biting you with that shit it will wake you up you can drive away bed bugs easy with simple cheap laundry shit they die fairly quick
  bed bugs are notoriously hard to get rid of they live in small crevices of the bed not under the linen and theyre resistent to most poisons  i had a problem with bedbugs when i rented a place in st petersburg for a few months the only way we solved the problem was by putting the bed upside down and thoroughly pouring boiling water over it multiple times  and yes me and my wife slept in the same bed and i never felt the bites only saw them afterwards but they didnt hurt but my wife did
  my wife
  more like that is what you get for sleeping in shitty places
bed bugs live little black spots on bed sheets or on mattresses from their shit and your blood ive gotten them in timor and in barcelona neither place made an effort to clean them just moved me to a new bed they dont hurt they just make your entire body itchy like as soon as you get into bed and leave this big red splotches all over you shit fucking sucks its like impossible to fall asleep
    nice job not even bothering to google this fact
  neither place made an effort to clean them just moved me to a new bed  thats what we do at my hotel in the states theres no reason to bother trying to clean it just move the guest call the exterminator and throw the mattress out
i hate bedbugs    pro tip until you call the exterminator conceal your mattress with double sided tape one or two strips horizontally around the whole thing bugs will be glued to the tape
  just get a mattress cover
i walked into a cheap hostel in ubud and saw dead bedbugs on the floor the manager told me they had been exterminated but i decided not to take a chance
  hey dummy you could be staying at the nicest hotel in town if the guy that stayed in your room before you had bed bugs now you do too
i have about a day and a half in both cities please recommend your favorite areas/sites to see 
going to russia for a few days what do i need to know and what is worth doing  also are 2000 and 5000 ruble banknotes accepted normally in russia or is it only smaller banknotesthe currency exchanges here dont give out smaller banknotes so
  you will probably get a better rate in russia if you can bring us dollars and euros  huge notes are accepted widely you can even pay with 5000 in a minibus that costs 30 in moscow
  do the mini buses give change back  is food cheap like in poland
  do the mini buses give change back  of course  is food cheap like in poland  cheaper
  dont get scammed by rogue taxi drivers use yandex taxi
russia sounds cool
 dont fuck russian milfs    use 1000/2000 banknotes another only by card   you can stuck in this country because of gopniks or drunk people
what do i need to know and what is worth doing  russia isnt made for small talk about the weather if youre a burger dont talk loud and often if youre in moscow go to red square if youre in spb walk on nevsky avenue if youre in neither go to either city    are 2000 or 5000 ruble banknotes accepted normally  no a small shop or some tourist sites will refuse them spend your large notes at a bigger store or at the bars then use the smaller bills elsewhere or bro up with some armenians like i did those fuckers will do anything for you    this is bullshit some cranky marshrutka driver does not have the time nor patience to change your 5000rub note
  another russian here  is correct also almost every shop here accepts cards so maybe you wont need so much cash
  dont fuck russian milfs  why not 
  aids
  then dont fuck russian
  dude what is it with people not dealing with small talk around the world even exchange students that ive banged will just flat out not respond to small talk they will pretend like ive said nothing at all
  one of the best advices itt
  why would i respond if you have nothing to say dont talk to me i dont know why the majority of anglos are obsessed with constantly talking as if they ceased to exist if they didnt make a sound i know a lot of them who are actually interesting and have things to say but they are the minority english/american natives just waste everyones mental bandwidth on completely redundant topics like who cares about the weather if you want to talk about solutions on how to prevent our extinction due to global warming yes that might be an interesting subject but dont try to talk to me about how cold or rainy or sunny it is that day its just a wasting your time my time we both fucking see the weather unless you are completely blind
  another russian here    which is better saint petersburg or moscow
  saint petersburg it you dont mind commieblocks moscow if you dont mind noise
  if you want to talk about solutions on how to prevent our extinction due to global warming yes that might be an interesting subject    being dumb enough to believe in the global warming fraud    not understanding enough about orbital mechanics to know that the earth and sun will be further apart for the next couple of decades due to the various orbits of all the planets positioning the two relevant bodies on opposite sides of the solar systems barycenter    not listening to the esteemed soviettrained solar physicist valentina zharkova regarding the coming grand solar minimum that will last 300400 years and will plunge the earth into an ice age much like the nongrand maunder minimum did in the 1600s1700s    in at least the following limited sense it is truly sad that the soviet union collapsed because you poor fucked russians have become a bunch of uneducated peasants again you used to produce capable scientists and would forcefeed the rest of your population with enough education to function now you latch onto religion and ironically leftist propaganda to fill your meaningless lives with stupid bullshit
  non anglos confirmed too dumb to be able to maintain a conversation and understand scientific concepts at the same time
  where in russia or eastern europe can i find girls that look like op
  she looks tatarian
  i was gonna say the same thing she probably does have tatar admixture    many russian people do they just dont admit it
    yes russia has an unusually high hiv rate for a european country

any help would be much appreciated frens
  try asking the guys selling coke outside san pedro prison
hi ive been traveling in mexico recently would really like to go back and explore more roadtripping is possibly my favorite way to travel im wondering if a roadtrip from austin tx to mexico city would be possibly or if it would be too dangerous for a foreigner im white would be traveling with a friend who is mexican born in the us both of us know decent practical spanish     not committed to the idea but just wanted to get a sense of what this would actually entail and of the potential risks involved
tons of people take motorbikes from the united states through mexico every year as long as you follow some common sense precautions youll be fine afaik the best thing to do is blast through the northern states and avoid driving in places like tamalpais at night once youre closer to cdmx you can relax a bit     stop being a pussy anon mexico is fucked up but youre not going to die just driving through
  just finished doing a 2 week road trip through mx starting from san antonio ive been in mexico before but i was suprised at the amount of police corruption we experienced at one point we were stopped 4 times by police in a 24 hour period when we were trying to get back into the us once on the road from saltillo once in piedra negras and twice in nuevo laredo i believe its just because they saw the expensive truck and thought they could squeeze some money out of the rich gringos haha we didnt have to bribe any of them but they did ask do you have money each time we were stopped as a first question when crossing into mx we did have to pay an official who was citing this law that vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating over 10000lbs werent allowed in i know thats bullshit     would recommend we had no issues with security as long as you are sensible  dont leave expensive truck unattended mexicans will steal the darndest things like your tailgate  stay away from shitty neighborhoods after dark especially in border towns  if you get robbed get in contact with the embassy asap
thanks for replies glad to hear that it is feasible     i have some family members who would consider this to be unbelievably dangerous but i got the sense that it was not just wanted to get some third party opinions to confirm this
this thread is relevant to my interests    for those of you who drove in mexico do you feel like the type of car matters how about driving a nice recent suv there would that make it more dangerous    also do you think the plate on the car makes a difference im from the north east and feel like my suv would stick out but maybe theyve seen it all
   is me  we drove through in a new f250 2018 with texas plates a new vehicle def makes you stand out we were mostly in rural areas but you see lots of older toyota tacomas and old ford trucks mostly in the cities you see sedans and hatchbacks very similar to us cars your suv will def stick out but as long as you protect it you dont have to worry
    so you had to basically keep up a 24/7 watch over your truck always leaving at least one person behind to guard it doesnt sound very fun tbqh
  i assume you mean tamaulipas since tamalpais is a mountain in the san francisco bay area
  i have some family members who would consider this to be unbelievably dangerous  partying in nuevo laredo is nowadays it used to be a prime party city for texan college students back in the 90s but gassing up your car in laredo and driving to monterrey in daylight is just fine after you get south of monterrey you wont have problems
  not really there are ample places to leave your vehicle secured if you would like to take an uber to downtown somewhere most hotels offer walled in parking with a guard its just the culture there
    yes phoneposting sorry
  how expensive generally are hotels with parking lots we are traveling on a budget one of the main appeals of driving    also would a guarded lot be necessary upon reaching cdmx if car was parked in the nicer areas condesa roma norte kinda upscale artsy neighborhoods having been to those areas they dont strike me as being much more dangerous than comparable parts of brooklyn in the us
  you have to remember that security is pretty much the culture there even in a shitty little hotel in a town of 1k people the parking was walled off with an old man there to keep watch all houses there are walled off and id say 95 of hotels would be as well
    forgot to add another option is to leave your car somewhere in someones hacienda to keep watch for you if you have a fluent spanish speaker with you it shouldnt be hard at all any mexican man will rejoice at the opportunity to guard a vehicle for hours in exchange for 100 pesos
  hey mr random stranger can i leave my property unattended here while paying you for the privilege of having zero liability  yeah sure bring your cousins over too the more the merrier    how fucking naive
  ignorant  there are plenty of expensive cars just about everywhere even in poor countries there are services in place to deal with the issue of safe parking
your car will be stolen but other than that it sounds fine
  talking out of your arse or speaking from experience
  tamaulipas is nice as long as you dont travel at night also dont bother bus drivers in the city they arent afraid of throwing the whole fucking bus at you to put you in your place
you are a texan just buy yourself a used corolla from the nearest ill eat a bug used car store and drive your way down without any concerns    even if it gets stolen its just about 5001000 nothing valuable    but thats just me
mexico is a shitty country to drive around maybe the worst in the world apart from the toll highways people but right onto the roads everywhere there are speed bumps every 10 meters absolutely everywhere in the country and in cities the traffic is unbelievable    its tolerable on a dirt bike with a suspension that can take the speed bumps at speed and can weave between stuck traffic in cities but youd be an idiot to drive a car there just take the bus
  people build right onto the roads
    t never been to a thirdworld country
  ive driven all around all sorts of third world countries on multiple continents mexico is legitimately the worst to drive in
always rent a car before driving into mexico
i have driven from eastern us to mexico city in a 2007 model suv almost every year for the past 10 years not a single incident most toll roads in mexico are far nicer than highways in states like nj or sc go through laredo take the western monterrey bypass make sure not to miss the exit for highway 57 before saltillo it comes up quick with short notice and is downhill and then just stay 57 all the way where you get off depends on where you are staying in the city let me know if you want to know what neighborhoods to avoid once in the city
  and there is a great buffet style restaurant somewhere in the middle of san luis which is always has fresh and tasty food la estacion is what its called
  have you ever explored further south or along the coast say driven from mexcity to puerto escondido
i plan on driving down to south america one day problem is the ferry service round the darien gap before roll on and roll off options existed where you went with the boat now its container shit that costs thousands takes days and you need to travel separately in a plane
  i did it on a motorbike a year ago thread is probably archived but with a motorbike and some guile you can still do the darien legit
    ive literally done this exact trip op     drove from atlanta to laredo to mexico city and lived there for a year drove down through monterrey/san luis potosi i made the full trip up and back twice as well as driving extensively around mexico city and monterrey     theres a lot to know a few big things and a constellation of small things you learn ill try to list the most important ones     edit this ended up being way longer than i thought so tldr the cops are wack the roads are shit the parkings impossible and your paperwork and gringo car sticker are worth their weight in gold that said it was a great trip to have done not easy but fun in its weird challengefilled way
    1 immediately when you get across the bridge to nuevo laredo youre just spat out into the city proper you have to drive all the way around to the customs building in nl there you must get your fmm 6 month tourist visa and then get in a separate line on the other side the building to get a temporary registration of your car in mexico its a six month thing and you get a holographic sticker for your windshield and some paperwork make sure the cars in your name or your buddys name and that every p and q is dotted on your us registration so that you can get this form and sticker and guard that shit with your life there is a free zone in the first 50 or so miles of mexico and including all of baja norte and sur where you dont have to have importacion temporal but if youre driving to cdmx you must have it there literally is a federales checkpoint on the highway that they wave you through and keep an eye out for gringos who dont have it ive never had anything but good experiences with federales and la marina who are the ones who patrol the highways and/or maintain these kinds of checkpoints when you leave mexico or make a border run you must go back to that building or its equivalent at another border city if you come back another way to get the importacion temporal cancelled its the line that all the cars are waiting in outside of that building in nl theyll snap a few pics of your vin number and send you on your way back across the bridge to the us     2 you must carry mexican auto insurance although cops never asked me for it but   they were very interested in my importacion temporal i got mine through baja bound
    3 the biggest one of them all is that local cops ruthlessly fuck with you in mexico city if youre driving a foreign plated vehicle almost every other time i drove one or more of the little bastards zipped up beside me and motioned for me to pull over they want you to pay them theyll say you owe a fine for this or that theyll say you need a front license plate to drive in cdmx theyll threaten to tow you or say theyre going to make you follow them to the station/impound lot blah blah blah theyll say if you pay them then and there you can avoid it its all bullshit you are completely legal to drive in mexico city if 1 you have your temporary importation sticker and paperwork and 2 youre not driving on saturday or your designated hoy no circula day as dictated by your last license plate number 3 you have mexican auto insurance always always present the importacion temporal paperwork show them the sticker your us license and say your state doesnt give placas delanteras front plates and that that the government has cleared you to drive asis as evidenced by your importacion temporal paperwork call their bluff say alright then lets go if they say follow us to the station then theyll take a few seconds and converse among themselves walk back and just hand you your license/paperwork and say cya later its bizarre and annoying but its a fact of life down there i hung out in monterrey for a month as a layover and never had this problem there its a cdmx thing
    4 expounding on the above look up your hoy no circula day and make sure you time your trip so that youre not arriving anywhere in the greater metropolitan mexico city area on either saturday or your hoy no circula day as thats the one thing break the trip up too theres literally no way you can get from nl to mexico city and get all your paperwork done at the border in one day my first trip down i slept in laredo the night before i crossed the border then hung out in monterrey for a month then when i left for mexico city i woke up at the crack of dawn and made it to mexico city by evening on my way back i would go from mexico city to san luis potosi and then the next day from slp to laredo     4b avoid driving at night on the trip down/up driving at night in a city is fine i got stuck on a long local road once at night and it was very freaky and probably very dangerous     5 take the cuota toll roads and dont do local roads at least on the first leg of your trip down there driving in mexico is its own thing and it feels like driving in the outback at times gas stations are few and far between and theres no exits like we have here youre driving for a long time you see a gas station connected to a little restaurant and travel plaza every 45 minutes or so and then you hit a city then youre back on a desolate road the cuotas are safer more direct roads there are a few places on the trip down from nl where you can take the local monterrey to saltillo is a good example but you should do the trip once full cuota just to get your bearings keep that gas tank topped way up too the local roads can seem enticing because you dont want to pay the cuota money but they vary wildly in quality long story short one time i literally busted a huge flat in an enormous pothole right outside of monterrey because i decided to take the local from nl to monterrey
    6 bring lots of cash on your trip down two reasons  1 because the cuotas are expensive youre literally looking at 50 plus dollars in cuotas no im not kidding 2 because although this is changing expecially in cities it used to be that pemex the national gas station only took cash and some gas stations still only take cash gas is also expensive like 3504 per gallon equivalent keep your gas tank topped up too i never drove with less than half a tank anywhere in mexico     7 this should go without saying but never ever drive after drinking any alcohol at all the bac limits are much lower than in the us as in like 1 beer and the punishments can be much more severe especially for gringos as you can see the rules are different for you and so you basically never want to give any police any legitimate reason against you as theyll often make up reasons of their own     8 obey the speed limit the speed limits in mexico are much lower than they are in the united states there will also be people who will fly by you in the left lane doing 25 over the speed limit its tempting but do not follow their example as you can tell the rules are different for foreigners and you dont want to give a federal a reason to pull you over iirc there can be severe penalties for speeding at least as far as the letter of the law goes     9 flashing your beams doesnt mean thank you like it does in the us it means fuck you and/or get out of the way people will also ride with their left blinkers constantly on which means they want to pass and get the fuck out of the left lane     10 the road quality is absolute shit even on cuota roads you need to always keep your eyes out for potholes and rough spots you will be dodging shit all of the time all of the time
  11 parking is fucking insane in mexico city in most places you can park on the street except where theres a yellow line except where theres a no parking sign anywhere near the spot youre parking except where some school spraypainted in faded letters saying no parking somewhere up the road basically i wouldnt recommend driving/parking anywhere in mexico city unless you absolutely have to for your permanent parking space where you live just ask the people on the street/neighbors where its cool to park i mostly drove my car to costco sport city soriana grocery store and parque delta big mall for movies and/or american fast food fix and back all of which had parking lots or parking decks     12 the road from laredomonterreysan luis potosicdmx is perhaps the safest highway route in mexico thats not saying much but it means that that is the route that you absolutely must take do not deviate absolutely do not go through brownsville/tamaulipas/ciudad victoria do not hang out anywhere within 200 miles of the border that isnt monterrey do not go further west than saltillo take that road and dont do any side shit check the us travel warnings by mexican state for an idea of whats what i could write an entire other post about safety and different zones in mexico but point being is that route is safe ish on cuota roads     all in all i ran into less trouble/bullshit in general on the road down/back than i did in mexico city itself but as long as youre careful have all your paperwork dont roll the dice on local roads like i did and dont drive at night youll be fine
all the above it why its retarded to drive in mexico just take the fucking bus wherever you want to go ado busses are nice or take a motorcycle since you avoid a lot of the problems you can dodge potholes you can park you can bypass stuck traffic take speed bumps at speed dont mind the expensive and often unavailable gas so much etc etc etc even on a motorcycle its still shit but a lot less shit t ive also traveled a bit in mexico in a rented car and it was retarded
  how about the concern that you break down in your shitty beater in the middle of nowhere mexico a much better way to spend that 500is to beef up your mexican car insurance policy so that its maxed out on theft and comprehensive
  oh fuck youre right i completely forgot about the topes
  also i just remember that every uncontrolled intersection in mexico is a four way stop its utterly retarded but then so is having speed bumps every couple meters just because    also in mexico people seem free to build their own speed bumps on public roads ive even encountered them on atspeed corners    they also have pic related everywhere which are specifically designed to cause bicycles and motorcycles to crash    mexico is way way way worse for driving than countries with literally no rules of the road mexico hat literal cargocult traffic control its like the saw pictures of how other countries manage traffic and said lets just put in lots of all of that without understanding how any of it is meant to work
  also having foreign plates is an invitation for every cop you pass to pull you over for no reason to ask for a bribe plus at every police/federale/army/marine/etc roadblock    random people children beggars peddlers indians criminal gangs insurgent armies also like to erect their own road blocks to shake people down    i could write a tome about everything that was wrong with mexican society as reflected through their roads its perfectly emblematic of what a mess the place is
    i could write a tome about everything that was wrong with mexican society as reflected through their roads its perfectly emblematic of what a mess the place is    shit are you me i literally have expressed this exact thought out loud to people this is so true

how do you feel about the british chav problem while overseas
  they dont travel beyond their enclaves in spain and greece and a handful of cities like amsterdam prague krakow and budapest
if ryanair doesnt fly their they dont
    im curious if their local haunts will improve or further decline after brexit happens
  by ignoring them seriously most are worse than americans but  anon mostly has it right they go to like 1 of 5 places each year then talk about how they are world travelers
    the scum of europe ran into them a few times in spain and greece ill never forget the stares if stares could killthe way local people stared at them was pure hate concentrated vitriolic hate they used to be confined to their shitty trash tourism islands but with ryanair theyre spreading all over the continent id rather take zero tourists over a single aircraft a year packed with those subhumans
  yeah i live in amsterdam and when im in the city center i just assume everyone to be british that way im right more often than not    the only problem i have with brits in amsterdam is that they need to learn some basic human courtesy    them throwing beer cans into the canals and touring boats and pantyless miniskirt wearing slags just crouching and pissing in the tram and bus stops is very disrespectful    the worst is when they rent an airbnb and fill it to the brim with like an entire hive of slags and chavs which in itself wouldnt be such a problem but do they really have to check the decibel limit of their vocal cords at 4 am on a tuesday night    hope brexit might lessen my personal problems seems like britain only sends their worst people to this city
british hate thread    will you americans at least learn to stop hating on us sorry you are so jelous of us getting free education healthcare and month long holidays now go be a good wageslave and work 80 hours a week for 40 years till you die on the job because you dont take care of your people
    youre pathetic lad you just cant handle the banter can ya
  british people are unironically the worst at handling any banter whatsoever    shit talks how americans are loud  generally the loudest people at a pub or bar but its okay because its me holiday  shit talks how others are bad tourists  somehow manages to do everything they complain about and then go the extra mile  talks about how others havent seen the world   spends all holiday going to one of 5 places on a month long alcoholic bender  talks about how no culture in america  has only been to nyc or la  gets talked back to or proven wrong on something   flips shit about how others are rude and not understanding
  this
honestly chavs dont bother me they are not pretentious they just want their sun and their beer i hate them for being drunks but thats about it
  why would it make any difference
  its just a bit of banter tho
  wasnt really the point of that post there anon
  its one thing to give and take banter back and forth with someone its another when the person giving the banter is the one who does what he complains about and cant handle any banter back british people are notoriously shitty when handling anything coming back at them they simply can not process the fact they have flaws    drinking with a brit bong overseas  dude ragging on bamerican politics and stuff even though he is getting all his shit pretty inaccurate  joke back haha well at least my tax rate doesnt take half my paycheck and i can own a home with a big yard haha  looks at me like i called his mother a whore and goes on rant about how the taxes help pay for free health care and a cozy flat is really all one needs  this goes on for several minutes     british people can not handle bantz even though they constantly hand it out
    you watch your fucking mouf m8
  finally found an english pub    so true it hurts no matter where i go every fucking time   hey where do you want to eat  aye o think e saw a british pub ova er  wanna try something local  nah we got nuff of at already lets get some good beer and maybe catch the game ya  proceed to talk to other brits passive aggressively  downs tons of beer  orders fish and chips yet doesnt eat it while hot just picks and nibbles at it for an hour complains its cold later  too drunk to do anything else that day other than sit down and drink  if mentioning about how we are missing something or should hold off on the booze a bit till after done site seeing  aye i avent even had that much t drink yet anon wes just getting started  proceed to be stupidly drunk and stumbles out after either being kicked out or cut off  goes to some store in attempt to buy more beer  sits down and passes out somewhere  rinse and repeat for length of vacation
    better then dealing with the chinese chavs are pricks but the chinese are assholes of epic proportions
  agree brits love giving but hate taking
  tell them about guns its a instatrigger for them
  yup but thats the issue its not banter if its not a back and forth thing its just becomes shit talking if you can handle anything coming back at you       dunno which a chinese person is solo or its just a couple without kids they are generally fine the shit usually hits the fan when its those bus tourist groups a brit can just fuck shit up solo and will actively seek out other british people to get drunk with
every country has these types though as an australian i am eternally apologetic for the travelling shitbags from nsw and queensland
  implying its only the yanks that have a scorn for bongs
  it has more to do with brits thinking they are a class above the rest when it comes to tourism i get really tired with how some of them act so smug and always fall back on the well i get a month holiday and free healthcare youre just jealous anon when anything comes up about them being the same as the rest of us
  the rest of us  nobody is like you lot  anglos are still eurobros nonsense brexit rhetoric aside and their society is a class society to the hilt nobody looks down as much on chavs as the english do themselves
  i caught a couple chinese woman taking a shit in the bushes like 50 ft from the colosseum brits are annoying but at least they dont literally shit in the street
    either they vomit piss of fuck in said bushes hardly makes a difference
  brits are annoying but at least they dont literally shit in the street    pfft hahaha  is right wouldnt put it past a bloke to take a dump either
    this is correct    brits are among the worlds worst tourists up there with russian drunks and israeli backpackers the british idea of travel is to go on a weeklong alcoholic bender and interact with the local culture as little as possible its just the fact that english is the world language that makes them so entitled and leads to them behaving in krakow or chiang mai as if its their living room
can we try and construct a decent list of top ten cities to avoid if you dont want to interact with these people
have any thoughts on dubai guys
just one big shopping mall very little of value culturally
    seconded been there twice both times on business its sad to think that for all the power and money the elite have they have a true poverty of imagination and creativity and have equated being a developed country with having x number of luxury shops a ferrari world and the worlds biggest mall     the food is pretty good though
  how were the landscapes over there were they huge
  soulless town built on slave labor whose people are engaged in a perpetual dick measuring contest to show off their wealth    absolute waste of time would never go again if someone paid me
i love the hotel the mindless materialism and the sense of opulence some place exudes  but it was also overpriced  if you want to splurge money go to somewhere like singapore or bangkok
  the trashiest place on earth filled with the worst people on earth one type of hellscape is the congo another type is dubai
    people arent always that friendly duh 
they pay english teachers pretty well in saudi arabia and the uae provided you have a ma  im tempted you guys is it worth it
  yes please

  its the arabian gulf what did you expect
  it sounds more like a death sentence for them
  idk i thought they were all degenerates
been there twice to visit my uncle who used to live in a nice part of dubai     tbqh i didnt think it was that bad people were pretty friendlyi got lost out on my way out of the airport and got a free ride from an egyptian migrant on his way to work at mcdonalds dude just told me it was too hot to be walking and refused to take any money     met some niceish africans too and my pakistani cab drivers were always very nicewas in a taxi once and the driver stopped to help an emirati guy whose range rover was broken down i dont have a very soft spot for islam but i told the emirati eid mubarak because it was ramadan and he literally started crying and saying thank you over and over again     area north of the dubai creek is basically little india/little pakistan/little poorer arab countryland but i had fun walking around there     having said that im in no rush to go back decent place to spend a couple days but theres fuckall to do after youve seen the malls and done some wandering
  it sounds more like a death sentence for them  yeah right mate
  2 years ago i went to abu dhabi for work there are several boxes with prostitutes the trap with black and one with only asian  i was once the girl took me to an apartment where they are several girls we fucked and thats all

  literal city of the future
  nope  urban and dusty
  low street crime since shania law applies but crimes commited by the upper crust is probably brushed under the rug  so its relatively safe if youre a tourist
  and they can be as pretty mature with them at times
  shania law applies

  just was accepted for a position at ef in wuhan for 10000rmb a month    this is a shit deal right
is this accurate
  100 accurate emperor akihito himself mandated that all rents be 55k yen may change when he abdicates and besides that a recent census of all 127 million people in japans 47 prefectures did confirm that yes all other prices are within that range
bump for dead thread
teaching english in cambodia here making good money in a cheapish city working 7 days a week isnt cash however
  10000 rmb    yeah 70 of that is going straight to your rent
  japan is one of those countries with extreme volatility in prices across the nation if you mean tokyo in an outerneighborhood then the rent is correct    taxes are dependent on prefecture but im assuming tokyo then it might be correct    utilities will be higher unless they dont have air conditioning    phone and internet are also widely varying and can cost however much you want it to be
  i see what places in japan prefectures city would you recommend id like a suburban setting but i saw someone saying its boring and tokyo is where its at or places to avoid maybe
imagine being asked for a photo and thinking yeah this is the one
what does /trv/for money when schools in se asia take the three month break i just discovered this exists
  use the money i saved to go to another school that pays more
where can i buy a good fake degree to teach english legally im afraid of getting caught without one    im thinking some seedy market type place in a random asian city but i heard khao san road in bangkok is gone     btw before people get preachy with me about teaching with a fake degree its retard work youre basically a glorified babysitter watching over brat kids and not actually teaching them anything its just yelling random english words at them while dancing and singing songs or having them throw sticky balls at the board
  summer schools private langauge teaching/tutor establishments i doubt they will hire a temp but if youre a native speaker they mighr
    wat in wuhanthats like the one of poorest provinces     secondly my understanding is the schools often offer/pay for accommodation so often you dont pay shit for rent
    meh not that bad really
    oh its babysitting but im too much of a faggot to actually do the work to be a babysitter    just get one online you pussy
  its retard work yet youre too retarded to even meet that bare minimum standard since you dont have a degree let that sink in
  sending my application today  asks for photo  have no photo at hand  feels bad man freaking japanese business standards are so strange
  calls it retard work  cant even meet the requirements for retard work  imagine being so far gone you brought an extra croissant instead of an extra chromosome to a down syndrome convention
  ian volunteers his free time to spend after class    i hate this hard worker meme
  are you saying you dont work at least 16 hours a day come on if you want to move up the ladder youll have to outdo legends like ian scientists claim that 8 hours of sleep is necessary but we all know an extra hour means more work can be done 1 extra hour a day can give you an extra days worth of work per month
      i dropped out of university because i didnt have the shekels to pay for it sue me as i said before you dont need a degree to teach your degree has absolutely nothing to do with teaching in asia
  except you do need a degree the governments in most countries in the world specifically require it     if you want to be a criminal and commit an act of fraud and hope somebody believes your photocopied diploma is real something any reputable institution worth working for can confirm in 10 seconds go ahead youre still retarded and think that for some reason youre so good that the bar for an already piss easy job should be lowered even farther for retards like you
  you dont need a college degree to be a ceo or in high management either but its a requirement anyways it must be sad to be you we both know english teaching can be done by an idiot but you dont even qualify for that id say try the stem way in but i doubt they taught you engineering or programming in high school
  our english levels are piss poor lets make a program thatll put white people in our classrooms  lets spend thousands of taxpayer dollars on this guy based and redpilled knows college is a jewish scam  spending thousands on someone whose last book they read was to kill a mockingbird  spending thousands on someone whose most advanced math knowledge is finding the long side of a right triangle
    is 7 days a week the standard in cambodia im thinking of tefl after i graduate this semester and interested in cambodia because i liked how laid back everybody seemed when i visited    is there anything about tefl in cambodia you wish you would have known before going over
  i can smell the yellow fever off him just by looking at his picture
  it must be sad to be you    and yet here you are where nobody likes you or wants to here from you    why do you think that is
  and here everyone is calling you a retard im sure it happens a lot in your life and you just think people are assholes and unliked its not them its you
  everyone    actually its just a random tefl thread and no they arent    i did mess up the word hear though oh well
company wants you to stay at their chosen apartment  no mention if you can move out and rent your own if you got the cash for it  why
  literally whats wrong with this
  so    i have a ba in english  and a be in tesol  i have two years teaching experience in a private college   it was shit run by a northern indian and bought out by a mainland chinese investment group never again  im an ugly white 28m from a defective family  dual citizen from an anglo country with estonian passport now  im not looking for a gf after the last one fucked my brother because she was drunk    im on the brink of just giving up so i thought before i throw myself off the local mountain why dont i teach overseas    i hear japan is saturated  but im not a fan of hot climates  i also am scared somewhat of islamic regions  and i have no interest in working with the fucking chinese or indians again  unless i can make sure if they try to screw me like their culture encourages then i can either leave no problem or fuk them until they scream    what do yall think am i fucked do i stand a chance of finding somewhere thats not a cram school  can i ask for double the normal going rate
vietnam

  if i had the means id put these titcows on a farm à la fury road
  witnessed and chromepilled
  not the guy but are viet girls attractive or flat faced
    dont start thinking youre any better lad
  very attractive
  very attractive  are they though
  yup
  seriously there are only a few companies or institutions looking for nonnative english speakers not from us/uk/canada/australia/south africa im so limited in my choices right now and thats why im asking people here for experiences on companies its either that or jet and the horror stories keep piling up but i heard thats just because of placement
  especially with the cost of living i work 11 hours a week and im having the time of my life off the money just from that and still some left over to save for more travelling      some are flat some are nice dont expect much from tinder though although youll get 100x more matches than in your own country their profiles are all exactly the same and they are shy because they dont speak english well 99 of tinder girls here are just bored students whose only interests are corporate drinks dogs and marriage  overall i much prefer girls from the philippines and thailand/ laos both in appearance and personality still the girls here are mostly kind and innocent no tattoos and piercings but hard to get to know the older girls are easier to meet and more interesting but unfortunately i believe the younger girls are more attractive in a cute look way but you cant get to know them easily
got an offer for ef shanghai should i take it  planning on going for the year then leaving if things are as bad as people make out in their reviews although i suspect a lot of them are westerners complaining about pedantic shit because they expected to be treated like angels
  only interests are corporate drinks dogs and marriage  dogs as in what exactly bestiality what percentage of viet chicks enjoy sex with their pets
  if you go before chinese new year be prepared to work 6 days a week during that time period based on how long it takes to get the visa situated youll be starting right around that time theyll get you set up but its not a school or a university its a training center for afterhours studying so youll be working nights and weekends
  im struggling to find schools who are advertising daves esl is just full of recruiters who will push you towards training centers
  youve been browsing imageboards too much mate
has anyone managed to do tefl work in scandinavia any demand there any successful excursions
  daves esl is just full of recruiters who will push you towards training centers  thats how it is senpai you literally need to travel to the country in person to get a gig in a school      has anyone managed to do tefl work in scandinavia any demand there  nope in fact nowhere in europe even eastern needs it  and even if they do theyll get their own teachers from their own countries  trust me i tried for four months to fins work in poland of all places nothing that wasnt a scam
  is the application process lighter for china than for japan wondering what i should do if i dont get my pick
  teach in africa instead
  id rather kms
why do so many opt for this miserable profession is it all the people with useless majors/no college
  i hate corporate america and want out friend modern work culture makes me want to eat a bullet
  because i want to live a life worth living i dont want a 95 crunch and i dont want to wait until i can retire at the young age of 75 to finally be able to see the world most people know it sucks but you get an experience unlike any other
  to add to this there are countries like czechia that will offer programs but you wont make any money doing it hungary makes you pay latvia is shit pay spain pays little etc
  profession  i see it as a good way to travel after university before going back home and settling into a career whats wrong with that
  thats what i should have done but i wanted to be responsible and pay down some of my student debt first so i tried the career shit and ended up wasting 3 years only to have the same amount of money i started with just fuck the job market extraordinary standards for shit pay ill take tefl mediocre standards for mediocre pay at least they give you a solid year of work and vacation time
  im actually a teacher in my country and the pay is shit and not enough to support a family
  isnt working 16million hours with shit benefits in china teaching english the same work culture anyway if not worse youre deluded
  ive heard its less than full time but havent in particular looked at china and theres a huge difference between shooting the shit with some engrishspleaking kiddos or pounding keys in a fucking cubicle   even shit benefits would be more benefits than i get now so
  hungary makes you pay  what the actual fuck
  fake degree    if you are doing something illegal fake degree the company will fuck you over as much as possible none of this shit is worth getting kicked out of a country/thrown in jail for
  this and military are part of the very few jobs that allow you to live abroad and fully immerse yourself in a culture for a couple of years or a lifetime if you can give me another example i would like to hear it there are always people i meet struggling to figure what else they can do abroad and they usually go back to tefl or just go home
  no other job exists where you get paid just because you can speak the language of the country you grew up in
  callcenter work in your native language plenty of that around in certain countries
well i got an invitation to eccs recruitment but it came so quickly are these an automated response anyway im gonna go for it im buying a nicer suit too
  devry
  i wish they didnt require personal interviews in my case gl anon
  im fine with interviews its references i cant put up its just a bother to need to fly on my own cost to another city for it all but theres no other choice id like to see seattle anyway i guess though the weather next month will probably be ass it should be less awful than chicago at least which was the other option   thank you anon whelp fuck the money and fuck my current job lets go
  the cost and visa application is a pain because tokyo is the only way go for in my case best of luck
  i wanted to be responsible and pay down some of my student debt first  ayyy same  it was a dumbass decision on my part imo  i basically worked below min wage in i shit you not eight different jobs over three years plus side hustles  did i pay it off  40 of it after living costs  fucking hell really wasted my time should have put that money in stocks and 401k instead
  eight different jobs over three years  about the same i was making more than min wage but with 13 months of unemployment between jobs it really knocks your annual haul down add to it that the cost of living is skyhigh and i was left with barely anything for my troubles not once did i receive healthinsurance paid vacation absolutely nothing tefl sounds great 5 weeks paid vacation social healthcare guaranteed 1 year of solid work with no layoffs or downsizing or bullshit no trying to jew you by offering one thing and giving you another low cost of living by comparison and the work is more fun with lower hours it sounds like heaven   if the west cant offer worthwhile employment ill take my business elsewhere that means i wont be paying tax to my home country anymore either and wont be supporting their bullshit id sooner go be a white monkey in china at this point  every time ive tried to be responsible and do what im told i ought to do its a huge waste of time and a massive disappointment fuck it corporate america can suck my dick im out  if i ever want more money ill just teach in saudi arabia for that 70k/year it cant be a worse shithole than the us and its close enough to europe and asia for cheap flights you want to cross the ocean its 1500 bullshit
anyone have any experience teaching in south america  i was born in mexico and speak decent spanish my english speaking surpasses it though from so many years of living in the states and was thinking id fit in a lot better there than in asia i was also wondering what you guys think of maximo nivel for certification 
  ive never done it but i met a guy who did it and he said he loved it there wont be as much growth as there is in countries like korea and china but its a great start if you want to make it a career and a wonderful experience if thats what youre in it for just make sure youre getting paid fairly and apply the same general advice as with any other part of the globe when it comes to this career choice have fun
how do people on a worse contract than jet justify even doing this shit shit job    jet is the best and it fucking sucks i cant imagine what the rest of your lives are like
  pay is shit hours are pretty long but it can be fun    dont do it if you need the money do it if you want the experience and dont mind making a few bucks along the way    that being said if you hustle you can get in good with tutoring and corporate gigs and be alright salary wise
no friends no family  cant communicate fluently with anyone  low pay  no job prospects following the contract    what do
is it possible to apply for ecc if i am unable to attend their 1 day recruiting session i am not from any of their locations and flying to tokyo and having a chance of being rejected seems too risky
so all these programs jet epik etc what happens when you run out those  like will other countries actually hire you to do a real teaching job
  working unpaid overtime before/after a 10 hour shift with zero benefit to you ever  i have some cotton that also needs picking bitch
  yes they will give you recommendations on their favourite spank bank
  with your english fuck no
  quads of truth    although there are lots of viet girls where i grew up and id say theyre pretty meh overall not the fugliest asians though
  what did i say wrong
  will they know what porn i look at  everybody already knows you binge javs kiddo know how they know
  im taking a plane to one of their domestics us expensive but oh well probably not japanese companies tend to have stiff standards
  anyone can plz halp    do schools absolutely require education degrees and reject people with actual knowledge of the subject matter because muh pedagogical methods
  i dont have an answer i can just tell you that it varies from state to state and its pretty hard to get info on    also you will still be a dancing monkey
  not him but basically it was ungrammatical
teach in taiwan or south korea pros cons thoughts
is it possible to get a masters degree while working as am alt or eikawa
  south korea  pays rent  taiwan   does not
is tefl going to get rid of my intense desire to kill myself
  where do you teach
  no unless youre on meth
  is it that hard i mean cant you do it on your days off or something
im the worst alt in japan i come 5 mins before class starts i have no materials the students dont like me and mostly ignore me and my home schoolhas complained about me over 5 times
  no to be honest ive been depressed my life in japan now and can barely even smile for a 5 minute intro    i highly doubt its for you
  what are the complaints about
  depends what you want to teach elementary you need a multi subject credential and high school you need a single subject you undergrad doesnt matter if you teach elementary and for single subject credentials any stem bachelors degree can get any stem credential and same for humanities middle school can usually take either credential  getting the credential usually takes 1 or 2 years and the difficulty depends on the state so for example an arkansas credential would be easier/shorter to get than a california one but california wouldnt recognize an arkansas credential i think a california credential is the only one accepted in all 50 states  this all pertains to public school a lot of private schools dont require a credential and will accept experience teaching or in a field as a replacement but a credential wont hurt   having a masters in math will definitely get you a pay bump and your school might let you move higher up in your department and choose what classes to teach etc also if you plan on getting a credential it may be wise to complete a masters in education as it could mean up to a 10 or 15k pay raise eventually    t undergrad planning on becoming a teacher 3rd generation of a family of teachers
  i come 5 mins before class starts    at least you show up to class    i have no materials    well youre an assistant thats up to the main teacher to plan out the lesson youre merely there to help out when needed    the students dont like me and mostly ignore me    kids are little shits maybe try acting like a shit to them and theyll respect you cant get any worse right    my home school has complained about me over 5 times    let them complain that country is full of passive aggressive fuckers anyway
  tfw graduating next year as a teacher  everybody here looks down on the profession  why though except the dancing monkey part
  from what ive heard the tefl teacher hate doesnt really exist out side of 4chan and salty nationalist retards so i wouldnt let the stigma discourage you
  tefl sounds great 5 weeks paid vacation social healthcare guaranteed 1 year of solid work with no layoffs or downsizing or bullshit no trying to jew you by offering one thing and giving you another low cost of living by comparison and the work is more fun with lower hours  top kek deluded monkey thinks this is what tefl is
  t undergrad planning on becoming a teacher 3rd generation of a family of teachers  based  t fellow pedagoge
  it cant be a worse shithole than the us  there is literally nothing to do there saudi arabia is boring af  folks go there because it pays well and they have nothing to spend their money on so they can some sizeable savings and fuck off
  why dont you share with the class what your observations have been
  wrong  i can hire instathots and shit on them
ecc interview in little over a week oh fuck guys this photo thing is stressing me out too the requirements are so stringent and regular passport photos are no good i have to get that done very soon not sure if my clothes are good enough worried my voice might crack or get rough oh god
  arianny pls
  breathe nigga breathe
    thats before tax right as other posters have said youll be spending most of your pay on rent    also are you teaching kids or adults kids teachers tend to get more perks paid work outings with free food and beer more leniency with annual leave due to the higher fuck this im out drop off rate    i worked at ef adults for a year its good for getting your feet wet with teaching theres very little oversight and they do a good job sorting out the visa  unfortunately theyre shit at everything else managers only concern is getting new students to sign up and do not give a fuck about existing students  your only value to them is cts course tasters
    bullshit everyone looks down on tefl teachers its a job that literally only requires growing up in an englishspeaking country and being willing/able to talk it has roughly the same skill level as prostitution but without the cachet    if you do it for a year or two after college to pay down student loan debt when you go back home employers will usually tolerate it otherwise even theyll look at you like youre some sort of waste product
  most people dont know much about tefl and dont care ive had two experiences irl with this tefl hate one was some guy that always tagged along with us to bars and would get drunk and talk about how much he hated us the other was back home when i met a group of engineers everyone was curious except this emo looking guy with problem glasses and skinny jeans he kept smirking at me and i think he wanted me to ask him what his problem was i hope hes ok i think he had a crush on a few of the girls and they werent giving him the time of day     then of course there are the weird overweight asian guys that for some fucking reason always wear white button down shirts and black pants and talk about getting home to their mom they are just passive aggressive though and dont really directly talk shit but i know they hate me poor guys     anyway sorry you dont like tefl man
  how do you know they complained about you why dont you think the students like you are you in the city or rural and why dont you make materials then
  accidentally thought about one of the high school girls as i came to nonschoolgirl jav  am i going to hell
  you sound like me desu but my schools dont complain because the city im in is such a notorious shithole that they struggle to keep anyone beyond a year or two and those they do keep are your paedophiles and 3rdworlders
  not banging your students    why else are you here
apparently vietnam is pretty nice
    pretty nice  quite profitable
  arent the students little children
  fuck off asia is full
im currently finishing up my 7th year as an english teacher over here in korea i thought about going back to america next year but i cant think of a good reason why teaching is pretty fun desu the pay is good the perks are nice and korea itself is a pretty cool place
  wtf you can teach adults what the fuck are you talking about
  do you even interact with korean girls or just fap to kpop
i am due to go to japan with interac on november 25th my liaison has told me multiple times that i am guaranteed a position with the company but they are just waiting on my certificate of eligibility to be approved before they give the official go ahead    my problem is that nov 25th is fast approaching and i would also like to spend a week with my family before i leave meaning essentially that i am going to have to go into work today and give notice i am so scared to do though because really there is no confirmation that im going    this coe application is taking so long and forcing me to leave everything to the last minute when i would have arranged all of this shit including my flights ages ago     should i give notice at my work how commonly are coes rejected
  both
i hated my tefl position but loved the country i was in word to the wise avoid cram schools theyre miserable places
  agreed cram schools are absolute shit if you actually want to get a decent job while teaching english in asia get a gig at a public school or better
    how do you avoid cram schools though  im looking through so many ads and theyre 90 cramshits and chinese
    honestly its tough do thorough reviews of blacklists and whatnot i managed to avoid some seriously awful places but still ended up at a pretty bad one
  get a government approved posting at a public school work for an international school etc  jet in japan and epik in korea are good gateways the bars are higher for those jobs but thats because the demand is there
  haha what city mate this sounds alot like my city we cant get anyone to come here    so far the complaints against me mostly from shitty bitch miserable jtes is not loud enough dont prepare materials dont speak japanese dont eat lunch with the kids  i mean fuck that its not a 45 minute     i offer materials and i read from a textbook and then i browse the net they know this and at least one school hates me for     i get paid 240000 i hate my not future wage compared to home and i hate being social all the time and most of all i am not genki and i hate genki im done in 4 months i will have ganbared through 9 months here    im here for a holiday and to explore japan not alt
  where can one find these blacklists please    this is why despite so many people saying theres a great need in china for english teacher i have no intention of going because of all the scams      get a government approved posting at a public school work for an international school etc  which require afaik a teaching qualification like a real one not a cert or dip
  not loud enough  i hate being social  speaking at a normal volume for a classroom is so basic how can anyone fuck that up jet is a job and it isnt even that difficult you can still explore japan and do the 1 hour of work a week it takes to be prepared for class retards like you are the reason that jet is considered a joke
  jet epik and similar programs still only require a quality tefl certificate and a ba diploma in any field to get in at the entry level unfortunately even these basic requirements arent enough to keep asshats like   from getting in
is anyone else teaching in spain    im finding it incredibly unrewarding im teaching at a university and the students never turn up to class on the first day only 3/10 registered students turned up and attendance has only gotten worse since then most days i find myself sitting in an empty classroom i dont mind having an hour spare to read but its become quite disheartening    i thought it might be because they found my lessons boring but every other teacher at the school has the same problem they just dont show up     when they do show up theyre always unenthusiastic and wont make an effort to speak in english i try to avoid grammar study in the classroom we write stories or watch short films or read authentic material which is geared around the grammar point but nothing makes them happy everything is a chore based on what i know about the state language education in spain i think they expect me to do grammar drills with them but i doubt theyd be any happier if i did    most of these students are kids with rich parents and while some of them are good students it adds insult to injury to know that most of them are just blowing their parents money off by not showing up    okay i just wanted to vent but if anyone else has been in the same situation and has any advice id love to know it
  its just how some unis work students miss lectures and just go to practical classes unless its a uni that controls attendance this is bound to happen even then there should be a final exam you can take even with zero attendance
i dont work on jet everyone wants to be an alt including the poor shitty third worlders that promote a lot of the hate on this class but once you work here everyone wants too leave    3 alts renewed for this school year that means roughly 22 didnt and thays just my city
  the poor shitty third    this right here is japans future the seas and indians working in restaurants combini farms and factories are the only fuckers who actually want to be in japan and endure the shitty exploitative work environment and terrible wages 95 of the first worlders who come here get massively dispirited by how assbackwards everything is and just gtfo in the first year or two if they even last that long    i firmly believe japan is a 2nd world country masquerading as a 1st world one and that it is at a similar point in its history to the time just before the meiji restoration ie extreme fucking stagnation but lacks the backbone to enact the major changes needed to save it
  thats because the majority of alts are autistic mouthbreathers that never shouldve even left their city see  or their subrddit as typical examples theyre the type of people who will take a psychology class and diagnose themselves with three mental illnesses by the terms end and cant even handle the pressure of appearing human in front of 20 children i have so many stories of the utter wastes of space i met during orientation that i wish jet had planted spies to weed out more people two people even left and canceled their program at orientation one person brought their parents with them    that being said theres some pretty cool people too and theres a strange correlation between nonautists and contract renewal japan is not a perfect country by any means and it can be assbackwards but the majority of jets can barely handle their own lives back in the us let alone in any foreign country whatsoever
  spain has a tradition of despising education and culture and of valuing ignorance and gullibility    during the civil war the nationalists famously proclaimed death to the intelligence referring to the intelligentsia the words are the same in spanish
what the fuck is it with god damn currypooinloos being ielts teachers even with no legal teaching degree its a protected title like doctor in australia and every  single  fucking  block headed autistic chingching china bugmen chink opening up three or four fucking pte schools and being expelienced teachers    fucking third world shitters fuck off and stop pretending you can speak english well enough to teach    all they do is take money do the work for the students teach them how to game the fucking tests and shit and undercut actual me teachers    is it no wonder that australian universities are overrun by mainland chinese who can apparently get master degrees but cant fucking order a drink without pulling out their phones to translate    learning esl and tesol was a fucking mistake lads aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah        and this breaks my heart the morei hear about the real japan the more it seems theyre inbred hicks trying to hold on to we wuz samurai n shiet  you god damn nips open up or youll be swarmed by china or worse islamic indoneasians    god damn why are seas so ugly they really do look like hairless monkeys
  i think they expect me to do grammar drills with them  i had that with two taiwanese students  they told my former boss they felt like they werent learning anything so my boss just told he that while he got i was applying western pedagogy most of asia doesnt culturally follow that so just give them shit loads of arbitrary standard tests    their language and outcomes dropped but they ended up finishing class more satiated and saying woe that was a hard lesson d    asian education is fucked yo they mind break kids in to a prisnor dilema and the kids grow in to adult who love being trod on    sad    indians are similar they have to be told everything and given exact instructions limited to no sense of self agency or initiative    but when chinese and indians do business hooboy get your anus ears and wallet ready for a rapin because theyll slit your throat and wear your fucking skin if it means they can make a few dollars more long term consequences be damned
  if the west was wiped off the face of the earth whatever apeshit education systems remained would send the east back to the stoneage in a hundred years
  implying australians speak well enough/clear enough to teach english  k
  the morel  indoneasians     im an actual teacher guyz  case in point    australian talking about ugly people  top kek youre english  uv poisoning
  not him but its a typo more i unless you thought that it was a misspelling of moral in which case perhaps your english isnt so grand anyway      its easy for australians to adopt a stupid rhotic accent to ape or mock americans dont worry
  perhaps your english isnt so grand anyway  i speedread not that that is an issue considering im not a teacher and so forth the top kep is the indoneasian comment though if you believe that there is a country called indoneasia you deserve ridicule     stupid rhotic  what is that
  again that isnt me though i am australian also who the hell wouldnt consider indoneasia to be a typo its easy to add an a accidentally when typing indonesia especially if youre posting ragey shit like that other dude im not a teacher either but i guess i just have a decent command of the only language i speak    rhoticity in english refers to english speakers pronunciation of the historical rhotic consonant /r/ and is one of the most prominent distinctions by which varieties of english can be classified
  who the hell wouldnt consider indoneasia to be a typo  nah that is more of a programming error from childhood the giveaway is asia in there for a country that actually is situated in asia its just one of those litmus tests of being stupid as fuck similar to writing could of instead of could have or i could care less or using literally to mean figuratively
  i think youre reading a lot into this for example i can claim that  top kep is a misspelling that indicates a severe case of involuntary celibacy
i have one class where im teaching letter combinations bl dr ch and so on   and all the assistants there try to teach them as bluh druh and chuh and its fucking wrong but they dont care because they either think its right or they think its easy for the kids    i understand the kids arent really getting confused about this but i had two assistants tell me today the lesson material audio is wrong and its correct to teach druhh instead of dr jurrr
  top kep  thats a clearcut typo obv also still not a teacher    and its pretty transparent that you are samefag with the original punter that ive been pouring derision on do you have a third party spellchecking you now
  i dont have any advice but how much do you get paid
  i have 45 8th graders in a public school with no aircon i have to kill 90 minutes and half the students dont have books what games should i play
are there tefl jobs only for the summer or do you have to do a full year
  ask them to draw something on the board like an elephant in teams  thats pretty fun for 15 minutes
  whatever apeshit education systems remained would send the east back to the stoneage in a hundred years  but at least they get good oecd pisa scores right 
  just leave mid contract happens all the time
  fuck i cant even kill 50 minutes dark alt lyf
if you are reading this and you are from the third world and youre wondering about teaching english i have an important message for you    kill yourselrves
  split them into groups and play a game like scattergories or balderdash bonus with balderdash is since theyre 8th graders itll probably take 1020 minutes alone just to explain the rules they wont understand the game until the first round is finished and if you play one or two more rounds thats another 20 minutes gone
    sorry about the delayed response lad reddit has an active tefl blacklist that is constantly updated so thats a good place to start you can also google the name of a school and see if you get any nasty results just make sure to watch out for inflated reviews that were clearly paid for or done by the school itself
  reddit has an active tefl blacklist that is constantly updated  thanks fren
i have a stem degree tefl cert and loads of teaching experience how can i get into teaching stem in china
  be white
  whats the best country to teach in if youre interested in meeting asian cuties     27 year olds 61 white skinny guy here
  i heard australia is pretty good
  literally any of them however the more first world/developed it becomes the generally more difficult it becomes to get laid thailand first date home run japan first date first base
      thanks guys team pictionary is a solid game but for the real problem classes they wont really do it part of the problem is that immediately before my english class my worst two classes have shop so they show up with a lot of things they can pretend are swords       balderdash  good call im going to do this for sure thanks
  nyc
  not much but i work less than 15 hours per week and my rent is dirt cheap 300 because i live in a poor area total about 800 euros enough to save 10001500 over the course of a year if i want to    by the way the situation has slightly improved since i wrote that post examinations are coming up and my classes are busier i was pretty depressed when i wrote that post overall the situation in spain is good apart from the lowish pay watch out for the bureaucracy and try to get your citizenship number before you start work if you come out here because it can be a real hassle otherwise
  split the class into two or more teams elect an artist from each group show each seated group an image with a lot going on in it each team has to describe their image to their respective artist and the artist has to draw it on the board from hearing it described    good for practising prepositions present continuous eg the man is holding a blue cup vocabulary and listening skills    use detailed images split the class into several competing teams and have each team go one after the other youre guaranteed to kill at least 2030 minutes without having to do much yourself
      the first time i looked at this entire list i thought there was maybe 6 games that could be used without an hour of preperation but you can go back to it every now and again for inspiration if you are stumped
any irish lads here
how urbanized is taiwan is it mostly rural or are there bigger cities besides taipei/new taipei
    keep in mind that the entire west coast of taiwan is pretty much urbanized i taught in and around taipei i grew real tired of the city life after a couple of months    besides taipei kaohsiung is always an option
    so you have 125 euros a week to spend on everything else thats not rentthats fukin terrible not hating just saying
    i have a stem degree    then why the fuck do you want to teach english abroad
  yes currently in china whats up
  its fine for me im not here to earn big money im here to learn spanish if i wanted money i could have gone to china im very frugal and i get through the month with money saved
  not him but the stem  guaranteed job thing is a meme there are a surplus of graduates just like in any other field
  yep friend of mine did law well now hes teaching in argentina and hates it but gets to fuck phat assed thicc loli bunda
  because id prefer to be saving 4k a month teaching physics and fucking chinese women over competing with cheap and talented polish engineers for gigs in og also im a brit and we dont get these mythical 90k jobs that seemingly everyone with a stem degree in the us seems to be on
what are my options if i get a tefl certificate but dont have a degree
had interview  have to wait a week to hear a yes or no and a date of departure  departure might be in fucking september when i wanted to be out of here asap  god kill me ive never been this nervous about the results of an interview before im so impatient to go i want to hop on a plane tomorrow i dont know what happens if i get a no only thing i can think is try out with an even shittier company with lower standards
  thanks for the info anon how did you like teaching in taiwan in general did you learn mandarin
  you can go fuck yourself and then kill yourself you gay fucking homosexual faggot nobody in this world wants you and we would all be much better off without you sucking up our air go die in a violent and painful fashion and please film it so we can all laugh at you for being a useless fucking failure
  struck a nerve stay mad fagtron
  most places in asia dont require a degree  some dont require tefl certificate
  this despite all the fags in this thread trying to feel superior in having a useless degree its actually not impossible to find a job without a bachelors if you are a white native speaker knowing how to teach doesnt hurt either
    thats cool no hate here how long you been there and how is your spanish coming along
    nice to know thanks for the helpful responses
would doing this course with a joint honours in english help me in the esl industry or should i just do an unrelated degree and get a basic tefl cert with it    
  depends on what you mean  for simple english teaching do whatever a tefl cert or diploma where offered and if you feel fancy will give you all the leg up you need but if you want to make a career out of it maybe teach at the university level its important to have a good academic background   yknow if youve got the opportunity to make the best out of this career path youre choosing you really ought to dont sell yourself short man you can go places
  would combining the english with the linguistics and tesol be of any useconsidering the fact youd be covering more literature/poetry stuff would it help at all in pursuing esl as a career
  oh most certainly advanced level language courses at universities will always involve some teaching of literature because once students have gotten down their basics at the beginner level proper reading of proper books is a good way to increase language retention if you decide you want to do post graduate studies in education usually what you do teaching esl will count towards admission requirements i cant speak for whatever particular school you might choose but its usually the case assuming you teach at a greater level than say jet while likely not within your degree requirements i do advise you to take whatever language you choose as high as you can it pays off language is one of the best resume stuffers out there    its actually a lot easier to break into uni work as a language professor than it is for other faculties mostly because the expectations are quite difference as a professor of language your main job is to teach youre not usually expected to be a researcher with exceptions depending on school you dont teach japanese at university of hawaii without being preeminent in the field of east asian studies but most anywhere else much less fucks are given
  you should kill yourself white boi
im shipping out to teach in south korea on monday  any advise on what i should expect
  garlic and kimchi also weve had some pretty shitty weather his month lots of yellow dust floating in from china better buy a face mask if youre sensitive to bad air and the temp has been rapidly dropping hope youre ready to freeze your balls off this year were expecting the coldest winter in korea yet and thats saying something because korean winters are fucking cold    i agree with what the other has been telling you i got my celta and my ma in applied linguistics and ive had a ton of more longterm opportunities open up to me as a result
  you first darkie 
  is a ma tesol and ma in applied linguistics the same thing
  no different they have different focuses and can help you achieve different career paths however both are acceptable if you want to teach english in asia at the academic level
  ty for the info
  pretty well thanks i arrived in the country with a b1 level i wouldnt recommend anyone to arrive in the country of their target language with anything less and a week ago i had a date with another nonnative speaker c1 entirely in spanish felt like a real milestone to be able to carry a conversation for a few hours     i have come dangerously close to isolating myself though and its quite easy to do i know some teachers who have done this for years travelling from one country to another without picking up anything more than an a1 level in the language that to me is a huge waste of an opportunity
  oh and ive been here just under 2 months now
my friend literally got micro harassed out of his company in snag would be harassment/bullying and illegal in any normal country    japan csn be fucked
  is this for native english speakers only
    i highly agree if youre in any country for an extended amount of time make a fucking effort to learn the language this is half the reason so many english teachers have a bad rep all these retarded weeaboos who go to japan korea etc and expect to pick up girls and dont even make an effort to learn the language and then wonder why theyre so isolated    it is easy to become isolated in these situations but just make an effort most people appreciate it especially if its a language not commonly learnt as a second language
  micro harrassed    use real english terms man sad to hear though sounds like japanese passive aggression what happened and why
  pretty much unless youre fluent enough to be mistaken for one
  sounds like japanese passive aggression  i love when whitey gets btfo by our culture feels good  piggu go home
    or if your attractive
dfw chink  nobody cares about you  tell them im american they feel like they got the knockoff version  study japanese daily  teachers still avoid speaking to me  meanwhile my white coalt basically gets news articles gets to carry shrines at festivals and random salarymen want to take a picture with him just for existing  hes made zero effort to study probably stopped at hirigana ki  teachers constantly trying to talk to him and schoolwide applause when he says arigato  i always tag along with him and im essentially the translator they ignore otherwise hes a cool dude but i do admit im bitter
  the classic asian racism  cant wait until some sjws try to get in to japan
every single day flipity flip philopeano who is an alt in japan has told me their staying    go back to manila and eat chicken bones from a bin like you were born to do
  your ancestors didnt build america though if your chinese just flew in on a wave of opportunism and selfishness they didnt build the roads they didnt win the wars they didnt make run the financial markets    just one angle to look at this multiculturalism is evil and amoral youre a victim of it as much as anyone
i need a new job in japan for this march gonna keep the internet browsing going one hear longer    i applied with interact but they didnt get back to me perhaps due to me selecting tokyo is a location    i hate even the little bits of work i do as an alt playing games and such so id think a boe job is outta the question who should i go with and when is the beat time to apply ityou are already in japan    the pay for alts is so low
  chinese workers did not build the roads  this is what you really believe
  thats a railway bro no one even uses them anymore
  railways are not railroads  i will just ignore the fact that the pic shows chinese building america    if you want to pretend that there werent loads of chinese in the us in the 1800s working their arses off to build the nation feel free some people just arent into history
  there was a few who assisting in laying tracks just because they require less food than niggers dont pretend they built anything
  a few  citation needed
  native english speaker here there was nothing wrong with it
ive got a celta now along with a degree and being a native brit i mainly did it for the teaching practice but how much more useful will it be looking for teaching jobs to have that cert
    is one of my aspirations
  who else here /americanenglish/  one of my students textbooks looks like something was spilled on it  point at it and ask what happened  eto tea  no that is incorrect it is coffee coffee
got a connection that offered me a job with ef in jinzhou white native speaker from canada but no degree how fucked am i
why dont more people pursue tefl as a careerwhy is it viewed as something you only do for a year or two
is osaka more affordable than tokyo or is it basically the same
  1499663  whats with all the posts saying that the japanese are all functioning tards
  if you are reading this and you are from the third world and youre wondering about teaching english i have an important message for you  kill yourselrves  yourselrves  this my third world friends is a great example of irony
be me  31 year old  masters business and science  white/relatively handsome apparently this matters  accomplished professional business development pharma industry  quit recently a bit disillusioned with corporate world  have traveled main centers in asia with aforementioned job    im considering a teaching stint for a bit of a change of pace and to experience something different teaching seems like it would be a relatively noncommittal job as opposed to getting a job related to my career which i would stick at for 2 years does that thinking sound about right  it seems like korea would be the best option have been there a few times alternatives being taiwan and china     however my questions are i would like to teach adults or at least 1820 may lead to business ventures which i am always considering or outside of work friends/sex which is pretty neat possible    also i know my worth and will not be a slave are all contracts 40 hours a week  any advice is much appreciated
  i know my worth  your worth is being a white guy with yellow fever that has nothing better to do than teach english in asia
    i followed the same route and found that teaching english was boring as shit and the pay was crap
  japan is fucked every day im kicking myself for learning this shitty dying language to work in this shitty dying country shouldve learned mandarin
  yeah i would definitely be doing this for the experience not the great pay
i tried teaching english in vietnam and it was a pretty goddamn awful experience even public school jobs wanted you to be a dancing monkey even though theyre for not for fucking profit and the parents cant complain so theres no need to compete for sales or recurring students     what is with asian countries and forcing foreign teachers to be energetic and funny why dont they have the same standards for asian teachers     are there any serious teaching jobs in vietnam other than test prep which is usually hard to get
  shouldve learned mandarin  no point china will implode or isolate soon    african of south american thats the language to learn
  judging from this thread its all about dancing monkeys even though im seriously pursuing a teaching degree and not just tefl kinda sad that i get vitriol when i want to make a career out of it by teaching in japan because here in my ciuntry were more than dancing monkeys but also maids or housekeepers especially in the public sector wherein were expected to do all the cleaning participating in the governments new bullshit while also expecting us to teach 8000 kids in one school with only 400 or so teachers and the private cant compete in terms of salary
why is japan moving towards using 3rd worlders to teach english its just the blind leading the blind for fuck sake nothing japan does is ever remotely logical is it
had three classes in japan today talked for 5 minutes at the start thrn walked around pretending to help students or check their work    word of advise for jaoan prove yourself to be utterly incompetent like me they will complain bitterly and micro aggression the fuck out you but eventually theyll just give up    then ykur browse the net and get paid for it it must be said my other school makes me do a lot though    the monry your paid just isnt worth the hassle     lets get back on topic has anyone fucked a student tell me your stories    
  theyre all over the place in hokkaido in kyushu flipn philos    also unlike the whites theu have no intention of leaving they dont have good homelands to return to
  alt desuka
  just have to be white  who wouldve thunk
  thanks for making the english teaching profession even more of a joke you miserable sack of shit 
  dou itashimashite
    didnt fuck any students but my teaching aid i definitely enjoyed
im thinking of teaching in japan illegally     it sounds like theyre hard up for teachers if theyre resorting to hiring turd worlders fuck filipinos/indians and slavs taking those jobs they might as well go to an unqualified native english speaker     it sounds like i dont even need a work permit i can just leave and reenter every 3 months since most westerners have a visa exemption how much money can you stack in tokyo or osaka working a bunch of different parttime jobs
  all the stem jobs in the us go to pooinloos who are willing to put up with 100hour work weeks doing trivial shit    we waitu piggus get told were racist misogynist patriarchal scum and arent allowed to work    i have a bachelors and masters in cs and a decade of experience and cant get hired because i have us citizenship am white and i dont have a vagina
im stuck between pursuing japan or korea id then want to properly commit myself to learning whichever language i choose but i cant decide
  i think there are more opportunities and a better market for english teachers in korea than japan all of my experience with japan indicates that the esl well is drying up over there also korean is much easier to learn   however i may be biased as ive lived in korea for close to ten years now
  be the japanese government  hire unskilled foreigners fresh out of uni looking to do a cheeky gap year  dont check their credentials at all just accept anyone with a degree  act surprised when they have no idea how to fucking teach or adapt to japanese culture aka disregarding any logic and sucking your bosses dick not that you had any concrete plan on how to utilise them in the first place beyond hey howaito you come to za curassu and do za ingurish ok  be passiveaggressive and generally treat them like shit across all levels from the board of education down to individual schools  continue to feign surprise when nobody is remotely professional turnover is high as fuck and you need to get to get 3rd worlders to plug the gaps and japan continues to fucking suck at english    play stupid games win stupid prizes
  theyre not hard up for teachers at all nobody wants to work there except brown third worlders and weeaboos who quickly become disenchanted and go home english teaching pays like shit and nobody wants to deal with the neverending migraine that is japanese workplace bureaucracy
  learn mandarin and go to china thats what id do if i could do it all over again
who else is a highschool drop out /tefler/ here life has never been better desu
  grade 10 dropout checking in
  howd you become a tefler 
  where are you teaching no doubt your are white eh  i finished hs but dropped out of college
  based on your 10 years in korea do you think korean girls want to date foreign guys more or less as times progresses
will jet ever give people more input into where theyre placed the heat in the southern part of japan is the one thing that is stopping me from trying to do tefl
  i want to say more young korean people are becoming much more open minded to the possibility of dating and shaking up with foreigners there are still hold outs of conservatism but the quality of women who have been interested in me has increased over the years
  the salary has been stagnant for like 20 years and theres more ignorant weebs willing to do that shitty job than ever before so no
  why did you decide to live there
  the first year i came on a whim following that i found i just really like living and working here moreso than in america
  cambodia and online pulling 1800 a month from casual online teaching but only 1400 from the actual 4045 hour work week
  how is it going for you remember to keep your backup plan and a good savings invest in some online teaching
  its going okay  the tefl course i did in saigon taught me very little so it took me two months teaching fulltime before i had any idea of what i was doing there are a lot of jobs here so im not worried if i lose my job girl im with wants me and her to teach english privately at her house in the evenings  not sure if its a good idea or bad  what do you think also where are you teaching what grade etc
  thats pretty sweet i might have to join you down there   are you teaching for one of those chinese companies online or has cambodia joined the 21st century     what visa are you on
  i was doing 3 mo th tourist visas before but have a work permit now
would getting a degree that will allow me to teach science/biology be better than a degree that would allow me to teach woodwork/tech graphics and construction studies are those subjects even thought in other countries than irelandat least with the science one i can potentially teach in international schools
  whats your problem
  how many k girls u dated    also what do u think of korean guys
  oh nice even without a degree you got a work permit i hear a lot of people just do visa runs
  hes racist lol  wah wah brown asian messing up my white asian fantasy land
ive met some teachers who have been in the game for years and years leaping from one country to another sucking up teaching work never learning the language and never pinning down any real prospects what a vacuous parasitic life that is
  unless you want to make teaching abroad your career you aint teaching anything other than english
  you dont have a problem with parasites whats your problem
  fuck off cumstain
  feels good man
i have only been in japan for 4 days and im really scared the company i work for is actually pretty mean and it turns out i didnt receive a bunch of vital emails from them which im being blamed for even after me and my representative went through my emails together looking for them i am totally unprepared and the other alts are not completely on board with being friends they have their own connections here and this is sort of a means to an end for them rather than the whole point last nigh t i was digging through my suitcase and i found a small envelope that my mother hid in there with photos of my family and note she wrote to me fucking ashamed to say i got in bed and cried i feel very lonely and i miss my family this is my first time overseas so i am probably just feeling growing pains i need to make the most of it all
  chin up lad
ive never been to los angeles before if i were never able to visit again what are some places/things to do that i should not miss out
  skip the whole city entirely and go to san diego
  it cant be that badand besides i dont really have that option at this point not one a single place
bumping will also be in la last week of december/first week of january staying in echo park would welcome any tips am going to feel out possibly moving there      theres gonna be tons of shit got the lp pocket los angeles book published this year and its surprisingly good canals in venice museums in midcity la brea tar pits pedersen auto museum lacma etc getty villa all the hollywood bullshit though the wb lot tour seems cool hiking in griffith park/los feliz  i will have a car so im planning on doing some stuff outside la like san diego possibly joshua tree etc you should look into that
  depends on the length of time and if you will have access to a car i will say    hike to mt lee hollywood sign and cahuenga peak  vasquez rocks  before woosley fire the victory loop trailhead  skyspace at us bank tower  wilshire grand bar on saturday nights  city hall observation deck free but open on weekdays  little tokyo and arts district  elysian park and angels view  silver lake  vista hermosa park  palos verdes estates viewpoint for sunsets  san pedro sunken city  rent a bike and visit hermosa and manhattan beach  late night taco visit in the south central area  koreatown for kbbq  hollyhock house  stahl house  grand central market  bradbury building  la live just for scale  disneyland if you must  americana or grove  lacma/petersen  getty  pasadena  mullholland/hollywood bowl overview  runyon canyon  walt disney hall free tours  west hollywood  portos bakery in burbank or glendale  culver city steps  kenneth hahn park    avoid hollywood venice and santa monica at all costs    t native angelino we exist
  santa monica  the pier isnt too terrible it can be cool at night  but yeah dont go anywhere near hollywood or venice or long beach
  seconded
  long beach is fine man but fuck the sm pier and hollywood
    whats wrong with venice and hollywood venice seems to have good restaurants and hollywood good nightlife no
          thanks for heads up and suggestions im probably going to get a rental hope driving there isnt too bad either
  not him but venice felt very skuzzy i grew up watching videos of the skate park and was hyped to see the area but it felt like the merch area of a sublime cover band festival that went on for too long it gave me that feeling i would get about an hour taking mushrooms when i when i was younger just kind of gross i did have the best sushi of my entire life right outside of there tho so that was nice i think part of the issue is that i had just gotten back from driving around the mountains in between malibu and thousand oaks and surfing in some very pretty areas     rent a car for sure sm a little grime too as ive said in other threads my favorite part of la is getting the fuck out and seeing the pretty stuff if you get a car the santa barba/los padres area is very cool
depends op do you have a car or not if no car you can have a really really shitty time in that city even with the rail system it still sucks due to how fucking big the city is
   pedro sunken city  stop telling fucking tourists to go there you stupid transplant
the broad plan for reservations right fucking now since release is limited   depending on the special exhibit at lacma it might be sold out to oblivion so check   lacma is near the tar pits and petersen so you can knock those all out in the same day i dont remember much about the tar pits   if the special exhibit at lacma is sold out and you feel meh about it those goddamn lightposts that every asshole takes pictures with is right in front   i like the huntington library chinese and japanese gardens a bit away from everything else but i really enjoy that shit   you can go to lacma and auto museum and do the farmers market and beverly center shopping in a day and enjoy some dining in beverly hills at night   little tokyo hasnt been little tokyo for about a decade  little osaka has about 15 bars and the wait for food sucks ass and the people there suck even more donkey dick than the current jtown crowd   people seem to like sd more but goddamn the people there are slow as fuck and the food sucks more cock than than fake bitches in studio     have fun anon and make sure you have your own fucking car and add 2030 minutes to your planned commute
universal city walk is nice stay safe it is crime ridden lock your vehicle vigilant at all times even as a tourist you can be made a victim of crime lapd will help a tourist try to get home safe if a victim of crime
celebrities in los angeles owe federal income tax taylor momsen may owe a federal income tax but i do not allow for any of my los angeles company corporation or entity to owe a federal income tax
los angeles form 1040 is the law of the land
heading to la on the 15th where should i stay for a few days  actual hotel ideas as well as general areas very appreciated
  everything you suggested they should avoid overrated shit that your average hipster out of towner guide book would show just skip la and go north or south much nicer    the only thing worthy of note is hermosa just kidding i live there nothing to do dog shit everywhere and the sand is dirty af in the winter
  transplant    unironically was offended that you called me that fuck them they are making la expensive for my family and i tbf plebbit is the one that is constantly promoting the sunken city in recent years      lolno as a local i do most of those but avoid crowded things like the americana or portos i like to keep some things to myself and hope they stay secret for as long as possible some things on the list are still relatively secret the hollywood sign for example people still think is off limits and only think that the main access is through beachwood so when you are up there its not as crowded as one expects
  only one  the comedy store  see a main room or original room show for 1020 w/ 2 drink min  avoid the belly room at all costs unless you enjoy laughing at autism  buy your tickets in advance if you see a particularly good lineup on the site you can catch nationwide headliners fucking around on an average weeknight doesnt exist anywhere else on earth that place is church  oh and dont miss the kogi bbq truck if possible check their twitter for locations the food is incredible for meals on wheels
  fuck outta here with your kogi truck
i live in la try to think of it as a pie but only the crust is good but the pie is dog shit the beaches are amazing the mountains to the north are amazing so is the desert tot he west and oc to the south but la itself hollywood the valley etc should be nuked
what if i want to see all the classic americana where can i see the remnants of the 1940s and 1950s la any levittowns that still have a lot of walking traffic and are near centers with markets parks and churches is there anything in particular of interest around glendale/burbank for a more homey experience    definitely gonna love trying out the hispanic food its fucking weak over here
  well go anywhere in south central for the old victorian houses rundown and ghetto of course if you want a historical feel even the historic core in downtown has that but with modern retailers go anywhere in burbank or the west valley like reseda or tarzana and go on any residential street to all of a sudden be in a 1950s suburb of single family homes the colorado bridge south of the rose bowl next to the 134 and the communities underneath it feel like being in the 1930s with the old eucalyptus trees and narrow roads beachwood canyon north of franklin goes into a little community called hollywoodland at the base of the hollywood sign that feels like the 1920s but i actually dont think we have that old style americana with a main street that isnt the equivalent of a huge highway urban planning fun fact la streets are wider on average and city blocks are superblocks that equal 2 or more blocks in other cities cause of cars and one that comes close will be larchmont village melrose and santa monica blvd west of la brea do have that main street feel but again full of modern retail
  what are some places  kristen stewarts house  things to do that i should not miss out  fucking kstew
what are some superstitions youve encountered while traveling     paraguayans believe that food must be eaten in a certain order and foods shouldnt be mixed eg drinking cold water after eating hot soup will make you sick soda and watermelon will kill you you must wait at least an hour to shower after eating or youll fall ill these are believed by the majority of paraguayans     others ive encountered french people think that wearing hats causes baldness     photo is of my house in paraguay while volunteering
  koreans believe that if they leave a fan on for too long in a room that theyre in they will die from asphyxiation or some such shit    seriously google fan death    i think this superstition got started because koreans are a bunch of homicidal psychopaths who go around killing each other all the time and one managed to convince the cops that he wasnt the murderer it was that fan over there clever bastard
transylvanian human sacrifice during construction of buildings
  no this is a way to explain away suicides in statistics without taking the honor away from the family many suicides are ruled fan deaths    the same is true in japan for karoushi people dont actually die from overwork directly its usual deliberate pill overdose as suicide caused by overwork its just called karoushi to hide away the suicide numbers    in japan having suicide in your family can result in a lot of social shunning so police try to avoid labeling it as such as much as possible    also something i noticed while living in japan for 4 years is that almost everyone is in a cult cults are socially acceptable in japan and people expect you to belong to one they are extremely creepy and dangerous to various degrees i assume its similar in korea considering the previous president was a cult member herself    this shit has very deep roots i used to be born into jehovas witness which is an insane cult believing in physical immortality i left the church the moment i could move out but in japan jw is a very large organization and i was actually hailed by japanese members that knew i was officially a member literally they came up to my fucking home that i never disclosed to anyone its bizarre
  cambodians see ghosts everywhere they dont even want to rent anything close to a pagoda cause that is where people bring the corpses that there is a shitload of monks there that should be able to weigh up the evil spirits they dont care about i could walk thru a killing field whistling at night while my local girl cant even sleep with the light off
  esl teacher
  explain away suicides  huh didnt know that havent seen it anywhere else before including wookiepedia regardless of whether the cops are doing that though a shitload of a lot of koreans believe in it to the point that they literally sell fans with timer switches on them so that they will shut off after a limited time and not kill you in your sleep      fraid not i do patent/ip law
here in reunion we have several superstitions based on the origins of the people  for tamil fasting and walking barefoot prior to amd then fire walking will purify you   if you are in bad luck and want the jinx to move onto somebody else you have to kill a bird usually a rooster or a duck a goose if its really bad and put it in a bag or a knotted towel and on a road if someone drives it over then youll be cured and the spell will stick to that person  they also sacrifice goats to their gods delicious get togethers ensues   they also make offerings to the spirits they put foods drinks sometimes even money in baskets at the crossroads nobody would touch those baskets with a pole even the non tamils amd it hilarious to see them drive on the sidewalks rather than touching the baskets with their cars    also the catholics set up little makeshift shrines all over the place blue one are for the virgin mary red ones are for st expedit whom you pray to in order to have things going your ways you are pretty much supposed to bribe him with offerings so you are granted your wish  they also believe that the month of november is cursed and is when the spirits roam free you should not party in november you should not walk with uncooked meat after dusk should never enter your house on the midnight hour  the white widow is a common urban legend where everyone swears he knows someone who has seen her    pretty much all i think of now
  also something i noticed while living in japan for 4 years is that almost everyone is in a cult cults are socially acceptable in japan  t watched too many anime where theres a pyramid scheme/cult subplot
i will be visiting corfu in late april next year i booked a nice apartment in agios gordios on the west coast and i will stay for a week i am planning on renting a car     any advice places i really should visit that are not in every guide book has one of you been there before have i fucked up i havent really traveled to another country before only when i was little  i will go there with my girlfriend and we are mainly looking for beautiful landscapes nature animals
  have i fucked up  yeah
  why is it something like a tourist trap as i said i never really traveled before is it because of their trash problem
  i went to corfu in early june this year and there were heaps of trash _everywhere_ according to the news they still dont have it under control    places i really should visit that are not in every guide book  there are no hidden gems left to discover on corfu you can try avoiding the coast and explore the mountainous inland instead lots of comfy dying villages that see few tourists and there are some easy hikes to a couple of peaks that offer stunning views over the island and the sea
im going to be traveling to the uk this spring    ive got an interest in medieval arms and armory particularly black powder weaponry    im also hoping to get a taste of some of best local craft beers    any anons have recommendations ive got quite a lot of time to move around so i wouldnt be confined to one spot
probably best to go on /int/ and meet the most autistic person you can find you sad cunt     if youre in the southeast though battlesbridge has a good antiques museum with some traditional crafting shit during events in summer

  dude unless you are split boarding high avalanche back country you should be fine just drive 20 percent slower if its not sunny and pump the breaks every once in a while if its wet try and rent a car with all wheel or 4 wheel drive   if you do go for a real snow hike you should get real snow boots bibbed snow pants and gloves that go past the wrist thinner layers are your best friend i think rei makes the best base layers value wise but thats your call do not go off trail dont be the tourist that needs rescue your phone dies waaaaaaay faster in the cold you might need to warm it up if the battery starts dying fast if for some awful reason you lose the trail walk back using your foot prints and call the hike off early    what part of are you going to be in its a pretty big state
    hey thats lake dillon i live right next to that in frisco
    ask away on questions i can tell you the restaurants to avoid areas to see etc etc     i can probably hook you up with some free ski rentals if youre trying to get on the mountains
    im supposed to be staying at some ski resort with family in keystone ive never been in snow been living in central florida all my life thanks for the tips     im assuming ill need a lot of cash because of tourist pricing
  unless you live at a high altitude the 7k elevations are really going to take a lot of of you just from normal exertion beware of altitude sickness you can be fine down in town but get up into the mountains and realize that you really need warmer clothing on in a relatively short amount of time better to drag around a coat than freeze your ass off if in winter and in the mountains you had best have good tires on the car and in certain passes have chains available black ice is sneaky you can wear out your cars braking ability quickly going down from a mountain so do not overheat them no guard rails wild trout is awesome wild bears not so much do not run into a herd of elk in the fog that is a bad day at best know the weather all summer in the afternoon/evening storms can roll off the mountains with bad lightning in colorado springs for every year i lived there there was a snowstorm at the very end of april and then it snowed again towards the end of september at elevation you will get sunburned quickly as there is not at lot of natural sunblock compared to sea level
  at worst itll be in the 30s40s  30s is worst case scenario here hehe and even then it only goes that low for a couple of hours a night for one or two nights every few years
  herd of elk in the fog    yurop here are elk generally defensive or offensive species
  defensive but they weigh 1000lb so when males are rutting or theyre startled with young you can be in a lot of trouble
what will i need   what are my chances of actually surviving the ultimate road trip   also post your dream road trips
  what car are you driving bump  i used to daydream of doing the pan american highway on a motorcycle when i was in high school i would definitely like to do an alaska road trip at the least
  i think a jeep is probably the best option for long distance trips over varying terrain   the panamerican highway would also be tight i heard theres a 100 mile stretch in southern panama/north colombia though thats only passable with atvs and theres a lot of geurilla activity but then again my route goes through multiple war zones
  my route goes through multiple war zones  lol do u have a death wish bro
  i can tell by your route that you dont know shit about the countries youd pass thru
an irish cycled the length of africa a few years ago fuck knows how he survived
  i met a french guy when i was in cambodia who did that exact route on a bicycle im pretty sure he said that it took a year and 3 months
assuming these arent just memes im not sure why people insist on going through afghanistan or sudan when their routes could easily avoid them
  how did he get a visa for pakistan as far as i know you can only apply 6 months in advance and it must be in your home country
  whats wrong with sudan unless youre crossing into south sudan its perfectly safe west of darfur id much rather go through sudan on a bike than egypt which would seem sketchy and chaotic as fuck or ethiopia where youll likely have kids throwing rocks at you
    sudan will be hard to go through but not impossible they have so many no go zones though its a massive pain in the ass for tourists your basically stuck on the nile highway all the way up not too bad if your keen on seeing various nubian tombs and stuff but you hardly get to see any of the rest of the country    also military there are cunts and hold you up for hours on end for no reason they dont really like westerners that much    south sudan is a whole other story ive actually been there recently believe it or not and its not possible to travel almost any of it by yourself youd need a serious guide and some mad balls to get through the north the south of the country is worse enough as is    i wish i got a pic of it but literally the whole time i was there there we had an armed solider in the van with us its pretty serious    pic related a major road through karomja territory in the south
  what were you doing there
  ill go with you anon i was thinking far eastern russia to lisbon though would you consider that       i have also been thinking about this as well i am american and speak spanish so itd be ideal but id still love to do something like ops picture     anyone know any good resources to research either of these trips
  yeah thats the darien gap in between panama and colombia from what ive read theres not even a real road there you have to climb through jungle mountains and also be amphibious enough to pass through swamps and wetlands and then theres the natives which could pose a threat guerrillas as well as narcos for anyone who cant afford something near an entire expedition team its better to catch a ride in panama city and go to a port in colombia and continue the journey there
    tf were you doing in south sudan    any fucked stories
  any source on that id like to hear more about his story id love to do the length of the nile but it just seems way to fucking dangerous
  people cycle africa all the time as long as you avoid actual hellholes like south sudan drc and somalia you will most likely be good    egypt  sudan  ethiopia  kenya  tanzania  mozambique  south africa is a perfectly viable route the smaller great lakes states and malawi zambia zimbabwe and botswana are safe enough too
    someone rode a bicycle through africa and posted it on /trv/ about 2 years ago cant remember if he was irish though from memory he had real issues with the sudan/eritrea boarder but somehow managed to make it through it    there might be a thread of it archived somewhere but if not its somewhat legit from memory i had just started to work in africa at the time and thought that shit was impossible too          im a geologist    im the guy that lives in the drc occasionally post and shoot down peoples hopes of travelling though central africa by yourself shits fucked here but you get paid a load working here     we were there looking for some lode deposits in the basalt flows in the south of the country theres a bunch of small gold mines in eastern equatorial but nothing major for a big company to take on i didnt take many pictures but heres another of me with some obsidian from a massive 3m deposit we ran into    we have also had a bunch of offers to work in western and northern bahr  car  chad but are unable to get a green light from our parent company cause we cant get adequate security thus no insurance hence why ive always found it hard to believe some random canadian guy on a motorbike managed to get into the country  then live in car for a year wit no issues    also    fucked up story when i was there talking to one of the guides he told me how prolific child sacrifice was in the region especially the sacrifice of albino children its also massive in parts of uganda but nobody ever gets arrested
  i wonder which route has more muslims the one that goes through the middle east or the one that goes through europe
       i think this might be a a different guy though he seems to know what he was doing i remember reading about a guy who had barely any experience with touring or even with cycling
  absolute madman  do you ever carry your own gun
  thanks for the info dude   ill check this guys story out as well     also what is the child sacrifice for i understand generally speaking it might be for religious purposes but im curious as to what motivates those retards and if the general population views it as justifiable or only a fringe group does
    nup but i do have an armed guard doubles as my driver when im in kinshassa and the company pays for security when we are in the field    could maybe get a handgun but dont see the point and also dont know how to shoot aussie btw        they think its good luck and brings wealth its often done on newly opened buildings so they can bring in business and easy cash though not sure why albinos are better than normal people ask a sudanese or ugandan im sure they know as its pretty common apparently
    not sure why albinos are better than normal people    ask your local witch doctor anon its cause their blood is meant to be more pure    living in africa and missing sorcery 101    ya dun goofed
  but the route that any tourist takes is the one going down the nile highway with some side trips the no go zones are the deep south and darfur including some areas bordering it and areas near the borders with libya and eritrea where you wouldnt want to go even if you could what exactly is the problem where do you want to go that isnt allowed only place of interest i can think of is those mountains down south which are being bombed regularly
  fucking crazy shit dude       you got any more details on african sorcery 101 anon im interested in the insane cultural practices
  also dont know how to shoot    kek    australians are truly and utterely cucked
  none
  though not sure why albinos are better than normal people  they believe albino children have magical properties every single part of their bodies from their blood to their organs have shitton of uses among witch doctors from rituals to potions to bring good fortune
would it really be possible to drive all the way from europe to australia itll take a long time for sure but im just not sure if thats possible
  this common practice in mozambique too our school had an enormous mural of kids holding hands with albino kids reading albino is my friend i taught a couple of them and i could tell it was a very difficult life living in a heavily impoverished region is tough enough i cant imagine being albino too felt for the kids
  the middle east will be tricky to get through syria and iraq is obviously off limits and the closed israeli border with lebanon rules out the only remotely safe passage through syria along the coast yemen is off limits too ruling out going through djibouti oman and uae to iran and fucking good luck getting a visa to saudi arabia if you could somehow get a saudi visa cross over to kuwait go to iran through basra objectively the safest part of arab iraq and assuming the land border with iran is open it could be done but i doubt it last i checked there werent any boats from israel to cyprus either like it used to be    my dream road trip is by car or motorcycle from oslo norway to singapore google maps wont let me plot in the entire route but something like pic related would be my dream with syria and iraq instead of the caucasus if those were safe enough for travel
   so this is me in this photo btw
   yes
  everyone fuck adam shute on his face
  this idiot kept on peer pressuring me with him on the bus back in college
  hot girls here
  would it really be possible to drive all the way from europe to australia itll take a long time for sure but im just not sure if thats possible  fuck you dipshit
  disney memes
  this book is very thread related
  nice d
  indeed so yes
  dat caboose
  youll probably die somewhere in here
  actually he will have higher chances to die in siberian shitholes hello zabaikale
  walking    my god for me that trip would turn into a nightmare by the 2nd month
friend of mine bicycled the pan american hwy from california to tierra del fuego i went with him for 1200 miles   i dont recommend it would never do it again dangerous difficult exhausting poor food etc he seemed to enjoy it somewhat but i thought it sucked ass
  slim to none
anyone ever been to argentina    ive got 1800 usd and 20 days im open to anything so if you had fun there please share
youll have a blast for about 4 days then youll run out of money  1800 usd is a lot of money for everyday living but buenos aires is expensive as fuck regarding prices and expenses    and if youre not coming to bs as then why are you thinking about arg    also weed is still illegal if a cop sees you you better buy him off or face jail time out of class hatredy
  why are you considering argentina  because i really want to go to south america but not brazil or peru and someone here said it was cheap
  maybe take a road trip from buenos aires to rosario to cordoba to mendoza and then to santiago    smoke a lot of trees and drink ayahuasca
  save up more money
  isnt it kind of crazy to spend more than 400/day
    why not brazil or peru    inb4 muh crime
  una vela
  no op no one has ever been to argentina
  not if youre out for party nights  as i said living is not that terribly expensive but say you go out to a club but a few drinks youll be 200 down your gutter and that is if you havent been lucky with the girls
four days was overkill lets do the math  100 usd today  3700 arg pesos  a drink anywhere from 100 to 200  a bottle of something 500600 of the cheap stuff like low tier champagne or that kinda shit  a cab anywhere 150250 if the cab driver doesnt fuck up with you uber can lower costs on this by about 30 if youre lucky    so say you go out for two beers on a pub with some friends you take a cab site to site on your hotel there alone you have 600 pesos say you but some grub its going to be around 150250 for a snack for dinner youll have from 350 to 600 each depending on fanciness of the place    that sums up to if youre going for 2 beers a snack and dinner and just paying up for yourself about 1000 pesos  25 usd     where is the money sink  on bars and parties if you avoid those expenses you should be golden but why would you come to bs as if you are not going to go out clubbing at night  a club night i have expended all around 3000 pesos on cabs drinks drugs renting a fuck room on some cheap motel and then coming back home thats nearly a 100 usd and im local    1800 usd is a lot of money but if youre not careful it wont last for 20 days
  no sensible person older than 19 would waste money on this bullshit though and actual travelling in argentina isnt really that expensive even counting the bus/planes to get to different destinations
youll spend more than half that on a roundtrip to  from eze     if you wanna go to lima on the other hand it can be done
  same here  i havent even been in south america
  nobody wants to go to lima though except for other south americans
  argentine food is pretty good too isnt
  so you pick the most european country of them all have you givrn this enough thought or did you just pick a random one    iguazú falls is an obvious choice personally i only did that plus the northwest jujuy province is georgeous    just go to peru or something
  ive already been to peru and i have a close friend who lives in brazil so im saving that for when hes free and we can do more shit together originally i was thinking ecuador or colombia but when i heard the argentina peso was shit i thought id give that country a try
  okay my bad personally im not a big fan of argentina but if youre set on going there ive given you what little advice i can share
  thats ok this is definitely preliminary planning im looking at march of 2020    i suppose i could go back to peru i did not get to do everything i wanted there but i generally like to visit new countries ill have to compare costs and see which place comes out cheapest i might be able to squirrel away some more money between now and then but probably no more than 400 if im being realistic maybe bolivia has some cool sights
  implying crime isnt a good reason to avoid it  dipshit
  hes worried about crime in peru  he thinks all of brazil is dangerous
  most of the places foreign tourists would be interested in are in fact nearby hotspots of crime but perhaps the militarized police will help i dont know from what ive heard argentina isnt exactly japansafe either
  why do /trv/ mods hate cartoon so much i thought their hatred was directly primarily at the stupid frog i did not realize that it extended to los simpsons as well they are cultural icons likely older than the mods themselves and very popular in south america  at the very least replace it with something relevant and appropriatewant a still from evita or something
  if thats the worst thing that happens to you oday youre going to be ok
  weak response cucked response
  cucked  not him but you are not using the word right
  so the argentina economy is shit but everything is still expensive  india it is
be me  20yo  mexican  musician and street performer  planing to hitchhike my way to the south  only been out of my city a couple of days in a church camp when i was 11      i want to move from juarez to guadalajara witch is about 15339 km or 1000miles  plane tickets arent too expensive but im looking for an experience i might take a bus is okay but only from one city to the next    i want to leave with nothing but a backpack and my guitar im a relatively good singer and i have been told that we mexicans are nice people so i think is almost impossible for me to not get 60 or so pesos for a meal about 3 dollars just busking a couple of minutes    also making vlog on yt of the whole thing might be interesting    i can find someone in any place to let me sleep in their couch if not airbnb motels and even parks are cheap alternatives    i would sleep in a park for sure but someone might steal my stuff wile im asleep    also im not in a rush ill be at least 2 months moving around north and mid mexico      comments questions advice
  first get the hang of busking in juarez   go down to revolution street and see how long it takes to make 100 pesos  are there any americans in juarez anymore
  oh and que classe de musica will you be performing
i live in san diego and during the first two weeks of january i was planning on riding my motorcycle the entire length of the 101 coastal highway    how fucked would i be re snow is this trip possible to accomplish if not how far north could i get
  youre pretty unlikely to see snow especially since it looks like its going to be a pretty mild winter what you will have to deal with is near constant blvery cold rain and drizzle once you get past san francisco if you do see a little snow itll slush up pretty quickly and start freezing as the sun goes down
  the 101 is so close to the ocean it would be pretty hard to see snow really the only spot you would be iffy is once you get north of aberdeen
  snow is not unheard of on parts of the olympic peninsula but not enough to stop travel mostly its just miserably wet and cold
      so i will at least try to get a raincoat riding in rain would suck dick but oh well thank you for the advice i have military issue warming layers so the cold wont be much of an issue i mainly want this trip to be an /out/ and /p/ experience so maybe rain could be cool anyway
  honestly youre going to need a full rain suit i dont care how many warming layers you have or who made them but they wont hold up to pnw coastal winter unless youre head to toe in rain gear also however much time you think youll need give yourself more because itll be pretty slow going
  why not ride ca 1 much more scenic than us 101 in areas they diverge
  this   might grab a rain jacket  lol youre gonna get pnuemonia and die before you even get out of california have you ever left san diego have you ever been on a motorcycle all day in 45 degree rain rain is usually worse than snow in terms of feeling cold
op here talked to my friends in wa im gonna drive it in my ranger instead lel        wasnt aware of this ill look into it
  ah i didnt realize the 1 takes the actual coastal route in mid california yeah i intend to stay right on the ocean for at least the whole way up maybe most of the way down too
  keep in mind if doing the 1 there are more slowdowns due to a few more cities and winding roads also watch your speed in them cops are always always on with their speed radars out
  this is a much better plan the coast can still be beautiful in winter but it would be miserable on a bike
  thats fine im making this roughly a two week trip thanks for the headsup
